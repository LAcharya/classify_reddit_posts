0,Are you sure you want to fire me?,"English is not my native language so pls forgive any typos.. Couple of years ago I worked in a big energy infrastructure company. I worked there for over 4 years, starting out as a technician. But because I'm a very IT oriented person, I soon found myself doing server maintenance and also new server room builds. Because of the nature of the industry in my country I happened to be one of the few onsite IT support guys in the whole country. Later I found myself to be the only one since all the others moved to different positions. I also did regular energy production maintenance, because for some reason the company felt they didn't need a full time onsite IT support.

About 3 and half years to my employment, I was diagnosed with an illness that affected my production maintenance part greatly. In fact, I couldn't do that anymore at all. I won't go into details with this. I could and was still doing the onsite IT support and installations since I was by far the most qualified and also the only one who was doing that at the moment. Our main IT crew was located in another country but I still made friends with most of them in my years of onsite IT support. At some point when the equipment was already aged many years we started having problems with it. I begun having jobs hundreds of kilometers away, and also in completely different maintenance areas as well (because all of the other support guys moved to a different positions). I had a colleague in maintenance, that I started to take along to some of the jobs, just because I really needed some help. Some of the tasks took several days, sometimes even a week of travelling to do them all. He wasn't really qualified for IT, but I thought he'll learn as I teach him. It turned out he actually learned some, but he was also very sloppy and got distracted very quickly. One time he even got himself electrocuted with the mains rail when doing server maintenance. But it is a completely different story. 

It turned out that the company was not happy because of the illness I had, and wanted me out. I could still do the IT stuff completely fine, but since that was not the position they hired me for, they started to give me some hard time. I contacted some of my colleagues abroad and they all said they really needed me for IT support and installations. After some time, the ""big bosses"" decided they didn't need me anymore since I was not able to do the work they originally hired me for. Let me remind you at this time I was the only onsite IT support guy in the whole country that was qualified to do that job. 

Some months go by and I was eventually fired. I tried to fight this termination with a union lawyer, with my boss and other colleagues in the maintenance, but with no luck. I had 6 months left and then I was out. I had no problem doing IT support because my illness didn't really affect that part of the job.

Almost immediately after I was no longer working, I started getting phone calls from the colleague I previously tried to train for the same job I was doing. He had his hands full with all the stuff I used to do before, but I could clearly tell he had not listened the half of what I told him. He was calling me to ask for the most basic questions of how to do maintenance and troubleshooting. I was dumbfounded that they actually moved this guy to IT support, since he had absolutely no idea how to do it, and I also recall telling my boss that this guy is no fit for this job. After awhile I head that the local boss (who was a really nice guy and on my side) was in trouble because he had no qualified local IT support for server maintenance and the guys abroad were asking what happened to me and they needed stuff to be done.

To this date they haven't got anyone qualified to do the job and the guys abroad regularly have to travel hundreds or even thousands of kilometers to do maintenance and installations that I previously completed in some hours. I can't see how the company saved money on this. It's crazy how detached most of the management is from the actual work and tasks.",2,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CCF24340>
1,"""This Mouse Doesn't Work.""","A short and fun one.

I'm the head of IT at a medical facility, and I was doing my daily walkthrough today (because people tend to forget something's wrong until they see the one responsible for it) when I was stopped by one of our newly hired front desk staff ($FD1).

""Mf9769,"" she says, ""this computer's mouse doesn't work.""

So I turn around and look at the computer she's pointing too, and it's clearly got a brand new wireless mouse (y'all have probably guessed where this is going right about now). Those batteries last months, so it can't be a dead battery. So I walk up, and start moving the mouse around, at which point I hear, from about 5 feet away ($FD2), ""MF9769! YOU'RE MOVING MY MOUSE!"".

Of course I am.

I go over to $FD2 and ask ""$FD2, did you take anything from the other desk"" and she points at her keyboard, which I know comes as part of a set with the ""non-working"" mouse. Apparently, she was smart enough to unplug the dongle and take the keyboard, but not to take the mouse, nor unplug the dongle from her computer in order to actually switch keyboards.

Naturally, I did what was needed and then asked the eternal question when something like this happens: ""Why?""

""I liked that keyboard more."" -$FD2",60,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEFDF4C0>
2,What do I DOOOOOOOOO (screenshot),"With the stories on here about having users put in tickets for errors without the actual error message...  thought you all might enjoy this. 

Again I have taken my time getting to the ""Actual Story"" but if you want to be boring and miss the fluff - it's the last few paragraphs. 

I have now graduated from ""unofficially IT but the person people go to"" to ""IT-ish is kind of part of my official job""  
I've recently been added as the 3rd person in a hodgepodge group that requests and troubleshoots access (or lack thereof) for the myriad of programs and permission levels for my decidedly non-IT department in a large Healthcare corporation.   
Sooo... many... permission levels!   
Along with the other 95% of my job lol. 

Anyway, that's only tangentially related to this story,  I'm just excited to be semi-officially IT,  or officially semi-IT.  

When I told my dad, who is old school computer geek - punch cards for solving grad school math problems and writing programs in Fortran old school - he told me that next time I come over he'll show me the powershell programs he's been working on to convert some lawyer's 20 yr old files from Wordperfect.  (He is semi-retired from the computer store he'd owned since the counter- sized business computer days.)

I told him that sounds like a blast and he burst out laughing,  I don't think he quite realized the level of nerd I am before that LOL...  I know you guys will understand! 

So, onto the Actual Story:  

We are pretty informal on my team,  and usually if someone is having issues they just shoot me an email or IM.  

So one of my good friends just changed her Windows password and was having access trouble all day.  (We have a lot of programs on single sign on and sometimes it goes a little sideways...) Restarted,  called the ""real"" IT folks,  all that. Was figured out, or so I thought... 
 
And then about an hour later I got an email from her with the subject line ""What do I DOOOOOOOOO (screenshot) ""

All that was in the email was an image of a blank login/ password entry screen that I did not recognize and an error message saying ""The proxy xxxx requires a name and password.""   
And nothing else.... 

Well at least I got the error message! Right?

So I messaged her...   ""Hey you....  What  are you trying to do, anyway?""

Turns out to be Adobe pro...  Somehow when she reset her password it didn't change that one...   

So I did what I could and verified she still had access in the Active Directory ...  and to try the ""password tool"" that's supposed to reset all passwords.  

A bit anticlimactic as then we were slammed and I'm not sure if it's working for her now.   But her email made me chuckle and hopefully it will do the same for you!",14,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEFDFBB0>
3,"Do what I mean, not what I say.","Background: I worked in IT support for a major bank somewhere in the UK. This tale is from long before Covid and Working From Home.

We'd always taken Disaster Recovery seriously, as long as we had a week's notice of the impending disaster, but that's another tragedy. But after 9/11, we started planning for Business Continuity too - what to do if your workplace is compromised. So we acquired a building on the opposite side of the country, kitted it out and wired it up, and we were all set.

The first test was a bit ropey, but we improved with practice and made sure to rotate staff and keep everything written down at the recovery site.

Skip forward a couple of years and I got the alert - it's that time and I have to join the other designated survivors across the country. We all make our way to Numbercauld, gain entry to the building and find our desks. Power up our desktops, boot up and connect to the - nothing. 

That's odd, none of us can connect to the network. One of the network guys has a laptop and dials in, checks that all the network switches have switched. Yup, it's all good, we just can't see it. So he starts following the network cable from his desktop PC, along the floor to the 2ft x 2ft floor tile where *all* of the cables are concentrated before going underfloor to the switch, lifts the tile...

And on the underside saw about 2 inches of each cable protruding into empty space. It was as if someone had taken a pair if shears and just chopped through the lot of them.

Which is what had happened. 

Some months previously, it had been decreed that *that* floor tile must be moved, I think it was to allow for more desks or something. The guy moving it saw all the wires when he lifted it it and asked what to do about them. ""Oh, just remove them,"" said his boss, meaning ""unplug each cable from its socket on the underside of the tile, so that they can be replugged later.""

But the workman's psychic interface was on the fritz that day and he only heard the words that actually came out of his boss's mouth. *Snip-snip!*

So yeah, we didn't pass the Business Continuity test that day.",24,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEF83070>
4,This computer is literally a bomb!,"I don't work in IT (I restore old computers), but this happened at my school and thought it'd be worth sharing.

So I walk into calculus. We had a substitute that day because our teacher had Covid - she was a nice old lady. Usually, the substitutes are given 2015-ish MacBook Pros to use while they teach. This particular specimen had seen better days; so I saw as my eye followed the HDMI cable from the projector to the laptop, it had grown a belly. The trackpad and keyboard were bulging up - the battery had expanded a LOT...

At this point everyone was still getting ready, the sub was taking attendance, and I went ""oh nooo..."" under my breath. I stood up and blurted, ""This is literally a bomb. this computer is a certifiable bomb."" I regained my sanity and said something to the effect of, ""The battery has expanded, it's bulging against the frame. These can explode, you should get IT to give you a different computer."" So the sub gets on the phone with ""IT"" which was really another teacher (we'll call him Mr. M) who had been providing the laptops. At this point everyone in the class is either silent or laughing at me with variations on ""it's a bomb!! uhauahaha""

Sub (incredulously): So there's a student in my class here who says my computer's a bomb, that it's going to **explode**.

**Me,** desperately trying to regain my dignity: The battery's expanded-

**Sub**: She says the battery's expanded and you should come and replace it.

(Side note: I'm a dude lol. I have a man bun so old lady thought I was a girl)

So now Mr. M comes in and I explain it to him, he replaces the laptop, the zoom is all sorted out, etc etc. I realized though, looking at the new laptop, that its battery had expanded too. what. I have so many questions. Mental note to talk to Mr. M later and get him to return the explosive stash to IT...

I run into him a few hours later during passing period,

**Mr. M**: Thanks for letting me know about the computer. I brought that one right back to IT. 

**Me**: No problem, sorry about that. Do you have more of these which have expanded batteries?

**Mr. M**: Not that I know of.

**Me**: Ok, actually also the one you gave the sub also had a bad battery, uh..

**Mr. M**: Should I go and replace that one too?

**Me**: Yeah probably. (I proceed to explain to him the dangers of expanded batteries)

**Mr. M**: Thanks for letting me know. I'll go and replace the other one.

**Me**: Alrighty bye :)

Disaster avoided?

""Hope your computer's not a bomb"" - my friend after the fact lol",62,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEFC07C0>
5,We Regret to Inform You,"[Previously](https://www.reddit.com/user/BlueCoatEngineer/comments/8bo0x4/jeepers_creepers_phd/)

**Friday Evening Shift**

***`BEEP`-`BOP`-`SKEE``DLE`-`BOOP`-`BEEP`-`BOP`!***

>**Bluecoat**: WAUGH!

I reflexively closed the VLC window and looked around in an absolutely suspicious manner.  Not that Kahuna would have cared if he was around.  Nobody ever called during Friday evening shift, for obvious reasons.  Our powers-that-be, demonstrating a willful incomprehension of reality as is tradition, had recently mandated our extended hours anyway.  Us senior-ish techs had turned these times into social gatherings where we got to watch contemporary Star Trek and enjoy take out.

>**Bluecoat**: Thank you for calling the Undistinguished State University Helpdesk, please state the nature of the technical emer-

>**RollerDarby**:  Dude, it’s RollerDarby.  Are you near the List Computer?

>**Bluecoat**:  No.

A good number of Mississippis died in the air as we waited.

>**RollerDarby**:  ...are you going to the List Computer?

>**Bluecoat**:  No.

>**RollerDarby**:  GODDAMNIT GO OVE-

>**Bluecoat**: Please hold!

Smacking the banish caller button, I pushed off the edge of the helpdesk towards my dedicated workspace for when I wasn’t manning the phones.  I’d managed to convince Kahuna that I rated one, given I was the one that maintained Beerys, our campus mailing list server.  With no one watching, I was able to roll *all* the way to the pimped out SPARCStation 20 I’d found abandoned in a forgotten storeroom.  It was the only computer I’d been able to find on campus that outputted video to a 13W3 connector and was capable of driving the absolutely-decadent-for-the-time 24” CRT I’d earned for clearing the College of Art catacombs during a previous adventure.

I clicked back onto the phone call as I waited for the 200mHz hyperSparc to come to life.

>**Bluecoat**: Thank-you-for-your-patience-we-want-you-to-know-that-your-call-is-very-important-to-us-and- Wait, where are you?

>**RollerDarby**: I-

>**Bluecoat**: And where are the delicious hot sammiches?  Why are we not eating delicious hot sammiches and watching Star Trek right now?  *gasp*  Are the delicious hot sammiches getting cold?

>**RollerDarby**:  I just checked my email on my phone-

>**Bluecoat**: What?  How the hell did you check your mail on your *analog* cellular phone?

>**RollerDarby**:  Uh, sorry, didn’t catch that- static.  I mean I used my laptop here at the sandwich place.

>**Bluecoat**: BULLSHIT, there won’t be wireless everywhere for easily another two years!

>**RollerDarby**:  FINE.  I’m at the computing center acr-

>**Bluecoat**: ACROSS CAMPUS, and by the time you get back the hot sandwiches will be cold and sad.  I’m starting the episode and deducting 5 points from Gryffindor.

>**RollerDarby**: Don’t worry about the sandwich, I have a solution.

>**Bluecoat**: Won’t work.  The Librarians took the grill.  Spirited it away for one of their weird weekend things and now you can’t fire it up without it imparting the smell of weed and hair onto everything it touches.

>**RollerDarby**: Not that.  Pull up a mailing list called ‘Inform-01.’

>**Bluecoat**: That’s one of Dean’s Office things, isn’t it?

>**RollerDarby**: *Is* it?

I could hear their shit-eating grin over the phone.  I typed some commands into a console and read the results aloud.

>**Bluecoat**:  Ok, let’s see… “Inform-01: Messages from the… University Office?”

Oh right, the Office.  The Office of the University.  The Office especially for the University, the University’s Office.  My eye began to twitch.  Based on their rising glee, I’m pretty sure RollerDarby could hear it.

>**RollerDarby**: Can you see what they’ve been sending?

>**Bluecoat**:   “Hot Widows In Your Area!”  “Used Hot Tubs Quarterly.”  “Rob Hobs Your Knob Jobs For Gold!”  What the damnboozle is…

I trailed off into a flurry of angry typing as I tried to figure out how much jackanapery had been going on under my nose.  Seven. This shitbird had created seven separate lists and was using them to send the lowest tier of junk mail I’d ever seen to thousands of folk.  This was especially bad, since the standard practice back then for dealing with spam was to simply blacklist the server sending it, and we were a major university.

>**RollerDarby**: See, now you’ve forgotten about the sammiches!  Be there in ten!

**Sammiches**

I took a cautious bite as RollerDarby stared expectantly for my reaction.  I winced; they were right, the “pastrami” from the vegan place was amazing.  I slid a ten across the table.

>**RollerDarby**: Thank yeeewwww!  So what’s with the Spammer-Jammer?

>**Bluecoat**: We’re not calling them that.  As near as I can tell, Fifty Shades-

>**RollerDarby**: I don’t get that reference yet.

>**Bluecoat**: -our UNIX admin didn’t know, or more likely didn’t care, about how to tie into the campus authentication system when he set up Beerys.

>**RollerDarby**:  Uh huh.

RollerDarby was a remarkably good technician for how little they actually cared about how things worked under the hood.

>**Bluecoat**:  So instead of checking for “is this person a student, staff, or faculty member of Undistinguished State University” against LDAP like a sensible person might do, he instead just checked if the email address you told it ended with “@undistinguishedstate.edu.”  Wanna guess who this bojo claims to be?

They talked around a mouthful of falafel.

>**RollerDarby**: No.  Eating.

>**Bluecoat**: zero dot cool at undistinguishedstateuniversity.edu

RollerDarby’s eyes got wide as they nearly choked.

>**RollerDarby**:  *GAHG* Wat.  Alright, *FUCK* that guy in particular!

>**Bluecoat**: Indeed.

I zapped all the lists that this escapee from the assclown circus had created before going back to my phoneystrami and Star Trek.  I was slightly disappointed that he’d gotten away with it for so long without users reporting anything amiss.

 **Monday Morning Shift**

I rolled into work nursing a coffee, my brain numbed by too early of a morning for Prof. Crappington to have dedicated an entire lesson trying to convince us that his idiotic method of solving Karnaugh Maps was revolutionary.  RollerDarby, with dangerous levels of pep, spun their chair around as I entered the Technician’s Pen.

>**RollerDarby**:  …so the important thing here is that you ask me how my weekend was!

>**Bluecoat**:  …how was your weekend?

>**RollerDarby**:  I spent it in jail!

>**Bluecoat**:  Oh shit, what the hell happened?

>**RollerDarby**:  I was driving down the highway and got pulled over.  Cop ran my license, came back clean, so he started wandering around my car looking for anything he could cite me for.  Tags are up to date, lights are all good, even have new wipers.  Still busted me and I had to watch them tow my car as I sat cuffed in the back of the cruiser!

>**Bluecoat**:  Wait, what did he arrest you for?

They put on a huge grin and smacked a pair of not-at-all buff biceps and matching gut for this next part.

>**RollerDarby**:  For being behind the wheel with two guns and a six pack!

>**Bluecoat**:  Oh goddamn it-

>**RollerDarby**:  So you should totally check your voicemail, the List Support phone has been ringing off the hook.  I woulda answered it, but don’t care!

I glanced over at the flashing red light on my phone.  No one ever leaves a message, let alone many messages, about anything good.  I decided that was a problem for the next hour.  Throwing my hoodie over the phone, I pulled up the List Support email box and slurped my coffee loudly as I read 

I slurped my coffee loudly as I read the email before me.


    Undistinguished State University Electronic Mail Administrator:

    Good day, I am Tommy Beeblebobble, attorney-at-law.  I am the owner of several mailing lists,
    Inform-01 through Inform-07.  Until yesterday, they were active and reaching thousands of my
    customers every day.  Through what I can only assume is at best incompetence and at worst
    malice, they have come to be unavailable.  Please restore them immediately.

    T. Beeblebobble, JD.


The baleful screaming in my head tapered and my vision began to return.  Pushing through the shaky-handed rage, I began typing.


    Good morning!  I am Bluecoat, caretaker of users, defender of network security, and keeper
    of the mailing lists here at Undistinguished State University.  I’m terribly sorry to hear that
    you’ve been having trouble with your mailing lists.  After some review, I unfortunately must
    inform you that your use of our automated electronic list server appears to run afoul of
    several university policies, including, but not limited to:

I enumerated the three dozen or so university policies that I was able to apply to the situation.

    In addition, I can’t seem to find anyone with your last name registered as a student, staff, or
    faculty member.  Use of campus resources, including the list server, is reserved exclusively
    for members of the university.  As such, your lists have been removed.  If there’s anything
    else I can help with, please let me know!

It took less than an hour for him to reply.

    It is unfortunate you feel this way.  I demand that you restore my lists immediately and allow
    me to retrieve my customer lists.  Otherwise I will be forced to take legal action for tortious
    interference.  I await your response.

    T. Beeblebobble, JD.

You wot, mate?  There be few things more detestable in this world than the jackass who tries to spin the consequences of their own shitty self-serving behavioral disorder into a problem for others.  I picked up my phone and punched in the number for Campus Legal Services, one of the many departments my group provided tech support and belly rubs for.  Their mascot, Legal Beagle, picked up.

>**Legal Beagle**:  Aroo?

>**Bluecoat**:  Aww, who’s a good boy?  I got something for you!  Who wants a toy?  Do you want a toy?

>**Legal Beagle**:  Ruff!

>**Bluecoat**:  Forwarding you and yours an email.  Check it, Rando Calrissian here is threatening to sue because I shut down his spam lists.  He signed up pretending to be a student and has been slinging hell of crass advertisements to unsuspecting folk using university resources.

>**Legal Beagle**:  Bark bark!  Woof bark arf?

>**Bluecoat**:  Well no, of course I don’t think his mother loved him.  To be fair, would you?  Also, you saw his JD?  Bar website says he’s not a member.

>**Legal Beagle**: *Grrrrrrrr…*

I grew up in a law firm.  Two important facts about lawyers:  First, the majority I have encountered are inexplicably crap at the technology they use every day.  Second, they universally hate, Hate, HATE it when someone lies about being a member in good standing of the Bar.  I dropped into the Customer Service Voice to confirm that this was No Longer My Problem.

>**Bluecoat**: So may I take that to mean that I have handed this incident off to Campus Legal Services?

>**Legal Beagle**: Arf!

>**Bluecoat**:  N’awww, such a good boy!  Alright, thanks!

He really was a good boy.  Two days later, I got an email from a less canid member of the department directing me not to worry about Tommy Bees and that I was free to drop any backups that I might have in my possession.  We can only assume that Tommy died cold and alone, abandoned by his blood, forgotten by his colleagues, and buried in his own effluent.  Mere moments before he expired, a seagull shat upon his head.  His grave can easily be identified; it’s the one with the tallest grass.

Edit: New update.  Turns out the patient may have dementia.  The user went to talk to her about the age thing, and the patient apparently got angry that the user said she was 63.  When the patient went in for a procedure the patient told the doctor they were supposed to be prepping her right side, and the doc said ""I am prepping your right side.""  The patient then held up her left hand and said ""This is my right side.""

7,Power Cut,"#### The Setting

Early April, 2020.  Many of my coworkers have gone WFH.  I, on the other had not, due to my then-manager's inability to understand that a pandemic was underway.  Maybe he didn’t know what that meant?  My job, among many other things, was to support the WFH folks.

#### The Story

A little after lunch, my phone rings.  Looking at the caller ID, I see that it was one of the WFH users.  I brace myself for the all-too-common “my internet is not working, fix my internet” conversations, and I answer the phone.  We’ll call her Jill.

Me: IT, this is arremarref.  How can I help?

Jill: (oddly quiet, almost whispering) Hey, arremarref.  I’m sorry to be calling like this, I know you’re swamped.  I can’t connect to the VPN.  It keeps crashing at 20%.

Normally, my then-coworker handles VPN issues, but he was dealing with a connectivity problem on the production floor.

Me: I think I can help you.  Your VPN username is JillK, right?

Jill: Yup.  And I am using the VPN password.

Now, we have a separate password for VPN access as for AD, so her offering this information was a good sign.

Me: OK, good…  I’m looking at your user logs and I don’t see any anything since you disconnected about an hour ago.  Are you connected to WiFi or are you hardwired?

Jill: I was on WiFi, but it cut out an hour ago, so I connected the laptop to the router with the blue cable.

Me: Like a large phone cable?

Jill: That’s the one.

Me: Make sure it’s plugged in all the way on the laptop.  Those ports are tight.  Also, can you look behind the router to see if it’s plugged in all the way?

I hear her move around for a bit and I hear a faint click.

Jill: I disconnected the cable from the laptop and plugged it back in and it clicked in.  I don’t remember if it did that last time.  Hang on…

I hear her typing on the keyboard.

Jill: It’s still not working.  Hang on a second, I’m going to check the back of the router.

I hear her struggle.

Me: Are you OK?  You sound like you’re struggling.

Jill: Yeah.  I can’t see behind the router.  I’ve got to turn on the lights.

Me: Why are you in the dark?

Jill: I have a migraine and the light makes it worse.

Me: I’m sorry to hear that.  I hope you get well soon!  Is that why you’re speaking so softly?

Jill: Thanks. Yeah, I’m trying to ignore the pain, but it's wiping me out.

I hear her drag-walking around and flipping light switches.

Jill: Son. Of. A. Bitch. Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!!

Me: Are you OK??

Jill: Hahahaha!! Yeah, I’m fine.  My power’s out. I’m sitting here in the dark and, like an idiot, trying to get the internet going with no power. Haha!! Sorry for wasting your time.  I’m going to call the electric company now.

Thinking it was a prank, I checked the calendar… April 3rd, 2020.

Me: That’s OK, Jill. It’s not a waste of time.  You can use your phone’s hotspot to get connected, if your laptop and phone have battery left.  It’ll be slow, but it should work.

Jill: I thought hotspots were disabled a while back.

Me: They were.  I reenabled them for WFH folks to help make sure you’re not without internet when the internet providers will, inevitably, get overloaded.

Jill: Thanks!  I’ll give that a shot, after I get an ETA for my power… Or maybe I’ll use this as an excuse and rest my eyes…

Me: Frankly, in your shoes, I’d rest my eyes or take a sick half-day.

We spoke pleasantries for a bit, mostly about the state of the world and how strange it was that my manager (who was not her manager) required his direct reports to physically show up to the office during a stay-at-home mandate.  I did explain that I understood why IT needed to show up and that, with the decreased foot traffic, I didn’t mind it too much.  We also talked about the shenanigans her cat got into (like jumping at her passing neighbor through the open window), but that’s not really relevant here.  Towards the end of the call, her power came back on and I hear her groan, as the lights seem to pierce her migraine-struck eyes.",14,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEF5CA60>
8,They accidentally... the whole outbound email infrastructure.,"So I've been out of being ""IT"" for going on five years now.  I worked for a small company that made hardware that made multimedia files and to accompany that hardware we made software to manage and catalog those files.  I'm an implementation specialist, actually now implementation manager.  We had a very nice On-premises setup and a rather nice (if a bit buggy) Cloud product as well.  Things were great, but as things in the corporate world go, big fish eats little fish.  We were acquired by an established player in our market back in 2019.  The past 12 months or so have really proven that the new corporate overlord's commitment to quality just ain't there.

We're in the painful process of taking our existing kit, and kludging our hardware to work with some new Cloud app that is nothing like what our small team of 300 people made.  Our product; we chose to integrate with Microsoft Azure Active Directory for authentication as it offered flexibility for customers with and without On-Premises AD.

This new App, has in-house authentication based on e-mail address.  It can federate to Azure AD, but the lead time is 2+ weeks because ""reasons""  The old app, 2 working days to link to OnPrem AD (or less if I bought breakfast tacos for the engineers).  Admins in the app can't even reset or assign passwords to their users, the user merely gets an invite in their e-mail and if they forget their password they just do ""Forgot Password?"" and reset themselves.  All was good, until someone deleted the company e-mail processor account.  Not to go too far into the weeds, but the processor is a third party outfit that handles outbound e-mails such as marketing and sign-in messages to make sure they don't go immediately to the spam folder OR get blocked entirely by mail gateways.  Makes sense to use something like this to me, I mean we have hundreds of thousands of potential users on this platform.

But yes, our outbound email management account was deleted.  Along with the ""reputation"" our IP address had with inbound mail servers as not being a spammer.  So a customer I just deployed yesterday still can't login to see any of the content they've created with their hardware.   I did have a service account created that got its password setup before this unfortunate outage.  We asked the e-mail service for any help and they were like  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯   .  Just sign up with a new account and pay us more money for any overages.  No soft-delete, no tombstoned account that could be restored just a polite ""Get fucked""  No one can get their invitation e-mail to create a password, nor can anyone receive a one-time code to reset their password.

We've been ""Trying"" to roll this new app out since last summer, and my first deployment went over like a lead balloon.  That deployment went so bad I did just one more before we pulled back until a couple weeks ago.  Every time I get my confidence restored in this new product, crap like this happens and I feel bad.  Just bad that we're pushing this complete disaster of a cloud product on customers when we had a perfectly working one that just didn't match some Higher-up's ""Vision"".  The list of things I loathe about management's ""New hotness"" could fill a lot more posts.",12,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF01F430>
9,The Dumb mechanic,"Currently I work for a food processing plant as a maintenance generalist. My work contains a lot more than that and everyone on my shift has a different knowledge base and skills. We work on mechanical, electrical, pneumatic, hydraulic, computers, networks, fiber, etc. In other plants I've worked at the jobs are separated (mechanic, electrical tech, automation tech, computer tech, refrigeration tech, etc). We're all paid the same here (except refrigeration). For instance, one guy I work with is a licensed electrician, another has his A&P license, and I have a bach.computer maintenance and networking degree. 

I've offered my assistance a few times, submitted my stuff showing I know what I'm talking about. It's been turned down as ""we have a guy for that"" who is a contractor. It takes weeks for any computer/network related work to be done (honestly trying to get them to open up a computer tech position like they have at other plants). Hell, all I want is power user access. We aren't even allowed basic cmd access.

Anyway, my leads have figured out I'm good with anything that has an OS attached to it. We're generally assigned one line to work on from start to finish (all equipment on that specific line). Monday, a mechanic on another line gets a new computer installed on his POD ((Print on Demand) Windows OS, access DB, wifi, touch screen only, to a label printer). Leads can't get it to work, supervisor can't get it, his boss on vacation, and the plant engineer is there trying to make it work. Leads nonchalantly tell me what's going on (asking me to take a look without saying ""we can't figure it out"")

So I catch the hint and wonder over....

Problem 1: ethernet in the wrong port

Problem 2: IP address conflict (they had assigned the OS same IP as printer) I can't change because access. PE has to log in. 

Problem 3: wifi not connected

Problem 4: cover not closed on printer (jumper wire bypass came lose on board) 

Problem 5: printer settings all wrong 

I ask the plant engineer (solid dude, very smart, but hasn't said more than two words to me in the two years I've been here) ""who installed this?"" Of course it was the ""computer guy"". Guess he went and installed it and left for the day and couldn't be reached. 

Maybe that computer tech position will open up now? (I highly doubt it).",5,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF01F730>
10,"Stupid ""Boss"" Cripples Navy Ships Connectivity.","A little more than a decade ago when I was still active duty US Navy we were on a deployment and at that point sailing in the Mediterranean Sea.  One of my technicians was working on the main interface between the ships internal networks and the satellite.  Everything went through this system (internet, email, message traffic, ship-to-shore phones, secure networks etc).  We had been having a minor connection issue with the shore facility, Boss tells my tech to enter a change into the configs, no change, Boss tells him to enter a different change (without undoing the first), no change.  This goes on for about 30 minutes or so.  Then I hear this:

Boss ""change that to this, then restart""

Tech ""I have to copy the running config over to startup first, should take a minute or two""

Boss ""I know how this system works, I went to the school for it, just restart it""

\*Note, He went to the school for two versions ago, different OS, didn't work the same anymore.  One of the commands he had the tech enter had cleared the startup config file during the last 30 minutes\*

Tech ""If I just restart we'll lose every config in the system, and a reload will take a lot longer""

Boss ""Just do what I tell you to do, BiggerBoss needs to get messages out for our next port visit""

\*Note, I had talked to BiggerBoss earlier in the day, he was glad to not have a ton of emails coming in and couldn't care less\*

Tech ""Just let me copy this and I'll restart""

Boss ""Just get out of my way and I'll do it""

Tech walked over to me and said we had better open the safe and get the backup configs ready.  We entered our combos in the safe and pulled the disc.  I looked at the sleeve and the date of last back up was after we left home port, no big deal.

Boss ""What the FUCK!  I can't get into anything now!""

We walk over, disc in hand and get ready to reload everything.  Pop the disc in, pull up the file just to visually verify everything and the file has only the header, nothing else. I ask Boss, who according to the log did the last backup (it's an easy process and he usually always took the easy ones because ""BOSS"") if he had verified the file before he burnt the disc.

Boss ""WTF do you think I am an Idiot, of course I did everything was there""

ME ""Nothing is here now, Tech pull the older disc out and we'll try to rebuild from there""

Tech \*looking confused\* ""There isn't an older one""

Me ""There has to be, we keep two for just this reason""

Tech ""It's not here man, take a look""

I go through every disc in the binder, he's right it's gone.

Boss ""I shredded it, we only need the most current""

Me ""You wha...(sigh) Tech, hand me the sat phone I'll be up on deck for a bit""

&#x200B;

Because Boss wanted to save the ginormous amount of space that a single CD takes up we were completely disconnected with an empty box of a router.  It took me over 2 hours of dropped SAT calls to a few civilian techs I knew to get a new config made and sent out via regular mail.  Two weeks later we got the disc in hand and had the system restored in about an hour.  Boss was ordered BiggerBoss to not touch that system again while stationed onboard.

11,Can you please do my work,"Background:  
I am working in a social institution since January as IT Helpdesk and the guy who nearly does all the IT stuff.  


The Company had a rollout on a new software since nearly a year. Let's call this software Charles (Time Booking, Documentation about clients etc.) - Clients are, in this case, not PC Clients. Clients are the persons we serve with.... Well... Social stuff  


The Software was set up, then the Server fatally crashed, they started again, made every IT mistake you can do and \*tada.wav\* I am here...  
I don't understand every Part of the Software but fixed most of the mistakes... Now my company demands me to explain the Software... (Thinking a Pic with Gru and a gun. ""You know Charles? Explain it"")   


In the other handy, nobody really wants to use it. Unfortunately it is very slow and irresponsive since the Bss don't want everyone to have a suitable Laptop, Tablet or Desktop PC. I cannot do anything against it. Tried to convince my Boss about Chromebooks for Colleagues three times.   


Successfully ignored  


So, What happened today? This is the Setting.  


A wild $me is attacking  
and  
$C1 aka. the unfriendly colleague as well as $C2 as the friendly colleague.  


I came into the Office, booted up my PC, had some smalltalk with $C2 about everything going wrong in my Job.  
Smalltalk finished, opened Ticketboard, One new Ticket... In the Charles Queue. \*banging head on table\`\*  


In very bad geman grammar (I'll ruin the title in english for you to show it):  
""pleez book times for $C1 on client""  


The Description said litterally to do $C1's work. To do her timebookings and her documentation.  


$me: \*Maybe sligthy mean written\* (I had no Coffee yet)  
""Why should I do that? I am not responsible for your time bookings. It's the same as in any other client. Even though, mostimportant Info is missing (again)!  
I assigned you as representation for serving the customer.""  


Had another smalltalk with $C2 after that. She said thats impudent from $C1 and sadly this is the way $C1 is. I guess $C1 will be more and more part of my TFTS. Well... A LOT of colleagues will.

12,We urgently need you to restore this file,"Another story reminded me of this experience. I think it was about 1996 and I had a side job as “general IT support” at a nearby local government office.  Long time ago do I’ll enhance the forgotten details.  

The main IT strategy whenever they needed a new computer for anyone was to go to the local computer store and buy whatever was discounted that day. About 120 or so computers, almost all different and stand alone. And an AS400 with about 40 terminals connected. Each user had their own backup routine explained to them. Some did this but most didn’t.  

One day management decided they needed upgrading and a network with file server etc. In comes a big IT company and installs 25 new computers for management and their support staff, including room of typists.  

I get the task to replace the backup tapes on the two days I am around. I noticed that the tape wasn’t ejected automatically and has to be ejected manually. This worried me as all other backup tape drives I had seen prior would do this. I looked for logs on the server but found none. I even didn’t see any jobs scheduled.  I contact big IT company about this and their answer was: “Of course you can’t see the jobs and logs as they run with special permission.” I argued about me logging in with the domain administrator account but they ignored me.  

One day I receive a call from the legal person requesting a restore of a document they created a few days ago but was deleted accidentally by themselves just now . They of course always did their backup before being migrated to one of the new computers. They urgently need the restore as the document needs to be sent via registered mail TODAY. It is 2 PM. I contact Big IT company as I had no information on how to perform restores. They walk me to through opening the backup software and indicate me to select last night’s backup. I reply that the screen is empty. They don’t understand. I fill them in our earlier exchange from several months prior with their coworker and the special permission etc. You get it- I was right all along. They still ask me to manually index the last tape but dice.  

I walk over to the legal person (it is now an hour later and they have phoned me twice already) and explain that we don’t have a backup because it was never implemented. They exclaim that this can’t be true and that we will face legal implications if we don’t restore the file. We go back and forth a bit until they say the magic words: “If we don’t have this letter at the receiving end by end of day tomorrow we have a huge problem.”  They are pointing at a piece of paper on their desk. One sheet. A printed version of THE document. Two paragraphs of text with one handwritten correction.  It takes them less than five minutes to re type it all the time arguing that there should have been a backup.",74,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF01F580>
13,The most powerful sticker.,"IT people, I have done the impossible.

You know how one of the most common gripes in support is how you can solve a large fraction of user problems just by rebooting whatever device is causing you grief? Well I trained my users to do just that.

See, I use WhatsApp a lot at work to communicate both with my users and with my bosses and It guys. Our region in particular has a very casual approach to work colleague relationships, which honestly is a godsend. When I started here I found myself asking ""have you restarted?"" every day, several times per day. This takes several strokes of the keyboard, unacceptable. So I made it a WhatsApp sticker with a funny picture of myself  and the text ""have you restarted?"", and I got a lot of use out of it. Several times it became my sole interaction with the user in support tickets.

Now it's been a year and since then and issues that just require a restart have dropped from my ticket queue drastically. Turns out when my users got a problem, they would remember the stupid meme sticker and try a restart themselves. Users would save the sticker and send it among themselves when they were struggling with their printers.

14,Customer wastes the workday of my boss because no one wanted to try my troubleshooting step,"This particular incident occurred while I was working as tech support for a company that sells popular NAS storage devices.

Everything is paraphrased/summarized, I'm kind of just getting this off my chest:

1. I got a call from a customer who worked as a technician at popular local zoo. He was calling about the NAS device being unreachable despite being on. It was unreachable by all machines in the network, including devices in the same subnet and on the same switch it was connected to.
2. As a first troubleshooting step I had him directly connect via ethernet, a laptop to the NAS device; the NAS was reachable normally by the laptop using this method. So we know the network stack is working on the NAS.
3. We tried checking the switch to see if there was any rule blocking the NAS from connecting; we didn't see anything.
4. We tried connecting to a different port on the switch to see if it would connect; it still wouldn't connect.
5. We tried resetting all the settings on the NAS to default (in case there was something on the NAS blocking the connections), it still wouldn't connect.
6. At this point I suggested trying to reboot the switch because it was connecting through the laptop, but it just wouldn't connect when connected to this switch, even though there shouldn't be anything in the switch that's blocking it.
7. I'm called an idiot and he wouldn't take down 20 other devices just to test this case, and I remember him saying ""You KNOW that rebooting the switch will not do anything, it's obviously a problem with your device""
8. This case escalates to my boss (at this point I was on call with him for over 3 hours).  After an hour of talking to the customer, Boss agrees to bring a new NAS device to their location. (said zoo was literally 30 minutes away)
9. He goes there, replaces the NAS device; it's working! Comes back.  Case closed? no!
10. The next day the same dude calls back and I pick up his call again. Surprise! New device isn't reachable anymore!  Same symptoms as yesterday.  I ask if he's tried rebooting the switch. Get called an idiot again; escalate to my boss.
11. Boss drives out there again, comes back at the end of the workday. Says all they had to do was restart the switch to get the NAS to connect.
12. I write a note in our internal ticketing system about how, if the customer calls back with this issue, he needs to contact switch's customer support, and not us.",63,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF0236D0>
15,I need a file from my laptop,"(I know it’s been awhile since I’ve posted, more to come…)

One of our executives and a VP were on a business trip together and realized the presentation they had prepared was still on the VP’s laptop that he didn’t take with him. 

Phone rings
Me: IT, this is bambam67. 

VP: bambam67, please help me, I need a PowerPoint file from my laptop. I’m away from the office.

Me: Sure VP, is your laptop still here at the office? I can remote in and send you that file via email. 

VP: No, it’s not in the office. 

Me: No? 

VP: No, I left it at home. 

Me: At your house? 

VP: Yes. Can you please connect to it and retrieve the PowerPoint file on my desktop? 

Me: Is your laptop turned on and connected to the VPN? 

VP: No, it’s turned off and in my home office. 

Silence…no, really…in over 25+ years of pc support and I was a bit taken aback. Stay calm….

VP: Hello? Can you get my file please? 

Me: I’m afraid I won’t be able too. 

VP: No? Why not? 

Me: (trying to keep my composure) So…your asking me to connect from the office to your laptop while it’s turned off and in your home office…

VP: Yes, please. 

Me: (preparing myself to ride the wave of logical thinking) I’m sorry VP, unless your computer is on, connected to your local WiFi and logged into our network via VPN, there’s not much I can do. 

VP: So you can’t connect to my laptop? 

Me: Unfortunately, no. 

(I can hear muffled discussion between VP and Exec) 

VP: This is very important for our meeting. I really need that file. 

Me: I’m sure it is. (I put my thinking cap on) VP, when did you last work on that PowerPoint and did you happen to send it to anyone via email? 

VP: I did! 

(Suddenly our executive jumps on the phone) 

Exec: Can you please jump on VP’s email and find that file? I’m sorry about all this…(sounding very apologetic)

Me: Absolutely, Exec, put VP back on the line and I will logon my pc with his account and forward you the file. 

Exec: Thank you bambam67 and thanks for your patience. 

I was able to logon to VP’s account and access his email, and even converted his file into a pdf and sent both to the Exec.  

I saw both VP and Exec a week later, both were all smiles…I’m assuming the meeting went well. I like when it’s a happy ending!

16,Don’t ask for help if you don’t want to be helped.,"I have been working in tech support (level one) for less than six months. I work for an organisation so my customers are technically my colleagues. 

I am still new to the job and industry, but I have realised that people have a superiority complex when speaking to tech support.

Today I had a call from a staff member who couldn’t connect to the organisation WiFi. I asked her to try forgetting the network (usually WiFi credentials just need updating) and she said, in the most condescending way, that she couldn’t. 

She omitted information so I had no choice but to keep asking questions so I could assist her better, but she would say things like “what do you think I’m calling you for,” “duh”, “obviously”, “how would I know”.

She would interrupt me while I was explaining possible solutions, and she’d  immediately say “no, can’t do it” when I’d guide her on where to go/what to do on her laptop. She also left me on the phone to mingle with other colleagues for 3 minutes.

By the end of the call, she told me that she hadn’t, prior to calling support, attempted to connect to the WiFi at all. 

?!

Edit: End of this story is that I asked a technician to go over to her, as I had had enough of her being rude to me so I wanted to terminate the call. Though, even when I suggested this, she still found a way to complain about it! Awesome.

I’ve had “colleagues” tell me I’m wasting their time when I can’t solve their problem in 30 seconds. 

I once assisted a colleague with locating a link on website because he couldn’t find it. Instead of just saying thank you, he dragged the situation by telling me it wasn’t there; put me on loudspeaker; said my name very loudly and told me that I was wasting his and 30 other people’s time, as they were in the room with him. 🙂

I am these people’s colleague and yet I feel so disrespected. Don’t call tech support if you don’t want to be helped. I’m not a wizard. It’s not fair that I feel like I can’t be frustrated because I wasn’t able to solve someone’s problem, when they didn’t want to cooperate.",125,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF0276D0>
17,"Your grandson isn't here, but i am","So let's get back to my first ever ""official"" IT work. But before that, i think i have to get a little more in time.

I started to learn software developpment as a teenager (Thanks Internet), and was called the ""computer guy"" in my family even if my brother (twin) almost had the same knowledge about computer that i did back in the day. I was just able to code some small software, scripts, and webpage.

After my bachelor, i went to some IT / dev classes, and it went worse, way worse than i expected. I was bored by the basics stuff, i was far from home and family, i had no money, was eating once every two day, worst year of my life so far. I tried to keep up but the depression was here, and worst everyday, until i definitly give up and go back home 1 month before the end of the school year and skipping last exams.

At this point, I choosed to let my computer away for a while, and spend my summer with my family, and a lot of time with my grandma, as she was not far from where i lived at the moment. I was getting a lot better when she died 3 month after i gave up my classes. I think i will never be as much broken as at that moment to be honest, but i'll not talk more about this, as this is enough for the story.

I don't know why, but i tried another year in university, IT stuff again, but close to my home, and .. not so good university to be honest. I met a lot of people there, but i went in class for like, 1 month before giving up, i still went to university to meet friends, and work with an organization that was creating ""geek"" events around the city. It was a bad year for my profesionnal experience, but a good year for my mental health, but still had to work with IT stuff for these said event.

I definitively left school after that, i was a bit naive, and though that my knowledge was enough to get a job. Wrong.

I spend almost two years after that working for a small organization. The goal was to help people get a small job, but for cheap cost for people or small company. 

Most part of that was old people asking for help for manual task, because they couldn't do it. I met some nice people doing that work, and was searching a web dev job aside (wich gave nothing).

And this is where the good part of the story part, before i came to this organization, they knew nobody that could handle IT work, so when someone asked for help with their computer, they told them they can't send someone to help. When they knew i was searching a dev job and was ""good with computer"", they asked me if i could handle IT problems, and of course, for me it was more experience, more job, more money, full win.

So the next time someone called for help with their computer, they send me.

And it is where my story start (yeah, more backstory than an anime), they call me one day for someone, not far from where i lived, that needed help because he couldn't get to his webmail, i said i could go the afternoon, no problem. 

I go the man house, small house just outside the town, i knock, and the guy told me i was quick, and show me what's going on. I go on the webmail page, and yeah, blank page. I try in incognito, and yeah, it works. So I check extensions, it was the adblock that was causing the issue. 5 minuts and it's done.

I told him about that and he said it was his grandson that installed the computer, and he can't do much without him, but his grandson went on the other side of the country. As he talked about his grandson, i remember my grandma (previous year, if you can keep track of the time), and i started talking about her to him (after all, she lived like less 10km of him, maybe he knows her), and i talked about my grandfather's brother, who was living not far from here either (he died when i was young, and my grandfather died when my dad was young, so i don't know them really). And then we talked.

I spent the afternoon with him, for a 5 minuts work. At this day, i still stop to meet him every time i drop by, and help him for free if he need to.

That was the first time and last time i did IT with this organization, as they quickly understood that IT problem will often be less than 10min works and not worth the effort for the low price they were charging to people (less than 20$/h)

There was a lot of backstory, not so much IT, a lot of english mistake, but i'm reading a lot of your story, and now that i work as an IT / Sysadmin, i have a lot of bad story. And i wanted to share a good one.",23,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF027490>
18,As long as it takes.,"A little background: I spent some years in computer operations before moving into automated ops. This tale is from the before times. TL;DR at the bottom.

As long as the mainframe was running, it would create system management data about the jobs it was handling - tape mounts, disk reads, run times etc. We would run housekeeping jobs every night to collate this data and produce reports for the vendors, billing and other departments. 

All jobs were made up on punched cards by our Data Control team. We'd stick the housekeeping jobs in the card reader at the end of the night when we'd finished the day's work. Typically these housekeeping jobs then ran for about 15-20 minutes. 

An important note about punched cards: the information on these is coded in holes arranged into rows and columns. Each column represents a single character. Each row of columns is typically an instruction, or data. To simplify things, the card punch includes a dot-matrix printer that prints each character at the top of its column, so that people can read it.

So this night in 1988 (how do I remember the year, you ask? Read on), the card reader decided to chew a couple of cards from the housekeeping deck. ""No big deal,"" says my senior op, ""we can repunch them from the text at the top."" 

What we didn't know at the time was that the card punch in Data Control was faulty - the leftmost part of each character never got printed. This didn't affect the jobs, as the card reader only reads the holes, and nobody noticed.

After the housekeeping job had been running for a couple of hours and been through several tapes, we thought ""something's not right here."" So we took a look at the deck, then fetched the original cards from the bin. Our deck had ""33"" at the top of a couple of columns, matched by holes in the third row. The original also showed ""33"", but the matching holes were in the *eighth* row.

Yep, we'd told the mainframe to collate all of the housekeeping data from 1933 to the present day (in 1988) and it was busy trying to do just that, however long it took.

Swiftly cancelled the job, repunched the offending cards and reran it in the usual time. And submitted a report about the dodgy card punch.

TL;DR We told the mainframe to collate all of the housekeeping data from the past 55 years. So it tried.",16,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF027190>

Her phone is land line and doesn't reach into the room, so this is over several calls each time I ask her to go check something.

Then about half an hour later I missed her call back but got this voice message:

>Hey, Erna here. Or a magic person cuz just right away. I found it plugged it in and it works you really are a Healer. Thank you. Bye.

Which really made my day.   I'm a computer healer apparently ;)

Nice job Erna",40,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF027C40>
20,VP tells me I think the motherboard is fried... the computer won't turn on,"Many years ago, I got a call from a VP, who said her computer wouldn't turn on.  She had spoken to one of our programmers, who told her that it's probably the motherboard.  so I went to user's desk, and confirmed it, if you pressed the power button, her computer would not turn on.

""It's the motherboard isn't it?"" she said... I told her ""Give me 10 minutes to check something, I'm going to take it with me, and I'll be right back""

5 minutes later, I came back, connected all of the plugs, and powered it up.  ""Wow that was fast... you were able to replace the motherboard that quickly?""  

""No, your power button was broken; now it's all fixed.  Have a great day.""",91,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF027460>
21,Who is on call for IT?,"I'm typing this on a desktop with a full keyboard, so I expect you to judge my spelling and formatting harshly.

I'm not IT, but I am one of those unofficial go-to guys at work because I'm good with technology. I'm an RN who used to work nightshift. If the IT guys actually knew how many middle-of-the-night calls I stopped people from making, they'd buy me pizza or something. You know, they're ""on call"" so I should call them even though the solution is a reboot, 99% of the time. It took us a long time to break people of that habit, instead to not call someone in the middle of the night unless it's truly important and prevents you from doing your job.

One such situation was about 1:30am. I wasn't called over, I just happened to be walking by the nurses station and overheard someone ask, ""Who is on call for IT?""

Me: ""What's the problem?""

Her: ""I can't get this computer to turn on. When I push the power button, the screen stays black.""

A quick glance to the tower to see if the front power button was lit, and the problem was obvious.

Me: ""Well, it probably won't turn on because there's no computer there.""

The space on the desk just to the right of the monitor, where the tower had always resided, is bare save for the unplugged ends of several cables.

Her: ""...Oh""",184,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF027730>
22,How I ended up in IT,"So this  was back in the year 2001, (or maybe 2002) . I was in 6th grade which  is why i'm vague on what year aged 11 or 12. We had I-macs in the computer lab. I barely could operate it because my family had been ""pc"" since the Packard Bell my dad got from RadioShack in 1993, which is one of the seminal moments in my life.

&#x200B;

One of the horrible horrible things about those computers was the absolute horrible little half sized hockey puck mice they had with only a single button.

&#x200B;

I don't need to tell tales from tech support what it's like going from a standard mouse to that dang thing. On top of that the school macs themselves left me feeling very much like a PC guy in a mac computer lab.. wait.. yeah that's exactly what it was.

&#x200B;

Among other things for that computer class we had to save all of our work on floppy disks, which I also don't have to tell all you folks who have been in the industry as long as you have that storing anything important on a floppy is like writing something  important on a slice of cheese with a dog around. It's a matter of *when* not *If* you lose everything on the diskette..

&#x200B;

So naturally being the intelligent person I am I didn't depend storing anything on the floppy. I turned it in on the floppy but I didn't depend on it.

&#x200B;

So day 1 ask if I can bring in my own mouse to use because I really don't like the ones that the imacs have.

&#x200B;

""Well I really don't like that because the mice are made specifically for the computers and it probobly won't work""

&#x200B;

""Well no Mrs. B. The Universal serial bus was designed to be compatible with everything to replace the IBM PS2 port, which is 13-14 years old as well as the mac equivilant which I don't know the name of which is probably just as old. So really a mouse is a mouse but these really bother my hand"" I explain.

I basically dazzled her with techno babble. I still don't know the name of the old port that mice used to use on macs before the USB.

&#x200B;

So every day to computer class I brought my own mouse from home and a USB splitter as well as my very first (they had just just come on the market) USB thumb drive.  I even did the leg work and made sure it was formatted to FAT so it would be compatible with both mac and PC.

&#x200B;

I show up to computer class on day 2 and plug in my mouse, the splitter, and the flash drive.

&#x200B;

ANYWAY a week in I do my assignment for the day working out of the flash drive, and at the end of class I dump it to the floppy disk to turn it in.

&#x200B;

The next day.. I get a failing grade on the assignment for not doing the assignment.

&#x200B;

""Well that's bullshit the floppy failed, these things lose data all the time and are entirely unreliable, i'll pull the file off my flash drive and print a copy right now"" I tell her. She argues with me, accused me of just not doing it ect. In the time she's scolding me I bring up the assignment on the flash drive and bring it up on the computer.

""This assignment?""

&#x200B;

""You must have done that at home"" She then goes off on another tirade. I copy it over onto the floppy again.

&#x200B;

""The fact that floppys suck is not my problem, and it's not a reason to fail an assignment. You will find that everyone has these issues simply because floppy's suck. If you properly stored them in a hard box the problems could be reduced but that's simply not reality when we have to carry them all around the school. I myself have a flash drive that i've been using for my assignments and you probably never noticed"" I explain to her. I show her the file and she looks at my computer.

""There you all my class work even the stuff I wrote for other classes after finishing your assignments 5 minutes in"" I explain to her.

&#x200B;

""How'd you get that flash drive to work on the schools computers? I couldn't get mine to work"" she replied.

&#x200B;

""You probably just need to format the thumb drive to Fat32 instead of NTFS, Fat works on mac but NTFS is windows specific.""

&#x200B;

""I don't know what any of that means""

&#x200B;

""Of course.. take everything off the thumb drive so I can set it up right for you"" I reply. I completed the typing assignment for hour or however long class in all of 4 minutes, While everyone else is doing there assignments I ""fixed"" her thumb drive to be cross combatable with both her computer at school and her computer at home, then I played some stupid education game for the rest of class. Something with a space man or something. There wasn't anywhere cool on the internet to visiit.

&#x200B;

That's the moment that I realized that there's 10 kinds of people, those who can barely operate a computer but know just enough to do everything they need it for, and people who can actually fix and work on computers themselves. I also learned that formal education means nothing on the subject.

&#x200B;

And yes, I went to tech school to learn networking, learning all those cool toys that I couldn't afford to buy like blade servers and all that.",59,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEF7F580>
23,Did you even try?,"Technician for a casino, I got called because a slot machine door just would NOT open for them. Now usually it just need a more 🌟assertive🌟 touch to get the door open or shut, maybe they need to lift it a certain way so I don't mind helping for people who don't know the machines well.

I get there and the key is already in and what do you know? It's not opening for me. All my tricks don't work, I decide that maybe her key might be damaged or it's the lock so to be sure I try my key and it comes to my attention that they never turned the key in the lock, door opens....

24,It’s Not All Thankless,"Years ago I was working tech support at a theater (the play kind with a stage, not a movie theater) and I started dating a woman with a teenage son at home. And he did not like this new guy stealing his mama away from him!

Well I was newly divorced and living my best life, so I had booked a WWII tour of Operation Market Garden in the Netherlands, a full immersion event where we dressed up in uniforms, joined an armored convoy, and slept in foxholes. At the end of the tour my new girlfriend joined me for a week while we did our own tour of Benelux and afterwards we headed back to the States together to resume our regular lives. 

I had parked my car in the ramp across the street from work and took the train to the airport, so the first thing we had to do was go to the theater and pop by the office to get my keys. My girlfriend’s son met us at the airport and drove us downtown as this was the longest time he had been without his mother and didn’t want to waste a single minute when he could be chatting with her. 

When we got to the theater they decided to come inside with me as it’s a beautiful space and every person we ran into was unabashedly happy to see me and gush about how much they had missed me. From staff wandering through the lobby to the receptionist at Stage Door to random people in the hallway to my boss and coworkers once we got to the office, all gushed on about how much I was missed, although to be honest, the team was just happy they didn’t have to cover my duties anymore. 

By the time we left the kid decided that the guy dating his mother may not be so bad after all.",19,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF02B370>
25,IT is a thankless job...until it isn't,"Since there was a post detailing sweet experiences with users appreciating work done, I felt I should add to that simply because we really don't see enough of it.

As I've said before, I work for a fairly large school district as a L1 campus tech. Because of how large our district is (somewhere around high-teens in campuses, swiftly growing...) we don't have enough techs at the moment to give everyone a single campus. The high schools and middle schools have enough problems on their own that they require a single dedicated tech on campus every day. The elementary campuses do not have close to the numbers that the above do, so techs will get assigned multiple campuses to take care of through the week.

I recently was given my third campus to oversee, which just so happened to be the week after spring break...which came after two weeks of delays due to weather and state testing. So when I say I was backed up on tickets due to being unable to work on them, I'm saying my open ticket numbers were almost starting to rival that of one of the middle schools.

The week this story describes was my catchup week. From the moment I walked in the door to about 2 hours past lunch, my feet were in constant motion from classroom to classroom. This campus in particular was extra unlucky as my day to visit them happened to be the days that we froze over and school was canceled. So needless to say, they were REALLY hurting for tech help and I was really hurting to get my numbers down to a point that I no longer feel pain when seeing them.

It was around 10am on this midweek day and I had closed well over a dozen tickets by this time. Most of which were your standard issues. ""My projector doesnt turn on"" or ""my student's Chromebook won't turn on"" or even ""Suzie Q dropped her Chromebook and now the  screen is coming off."" I was in a daze and entirely functioning on auto pilot. My attention was shot, smiles were faked, and conversations were very brief because I was truly exhausted from all the work the week had brought me. This next ticket in my queue talked about a student having issue with a testing app, stating it was taking much longer than normal to load. No big deal, let me swing by and check it out.

When I stop by, I find the kid and ask him to show me what was going on. I immediately learned this kid was very smart when it came to figuring things out simply because he power cycled the Chromebook using the key combo (Refresh + Power) and I'm still teaching the teachers how to do that. He shows me the app and how its not loading properly, so I take the Chromebook and head back to my office. The best thing about these Chromebooks is you can just hook it up to the network and ""Powerwash"" it to reset it. Its like 5 button presses and about a minute or two at most. Typically this solves 75% of the issues I come across, and I was hopeful that this was simply something that could be solved by it so I reset it and tested the app again, since the machine is set to have the app installed based on the profile defined by the network.

I boot the app up and, sure enough, near instant response. Well, cool! Job done, on to the next one. I bring the kid his Chromebook after, at most, 3 minutes and they're shocked to see me so quickly. I explain what I did and ask the student to test if all is working to which I got a happy confirmation. All is good, I leave to work on the next.

You might be wondering where the happy part of this story comes, well...here it is.

On the way out for lunch, I'm on fumes at best. As I'm approaching the door, the teacher of that previous student passes me and goes ""Hey! My kids think you're a wizard! That student was convinced he wouldn't have his Chromebook back for a while and I told him that you were really good at your job and that you get things done really fast. Thank you so much for all your help!"" I belt out the most animated laugh i've had all week and tell her that I'm always happy to help.

Its these small things in life that make it all worth it, really. I did end up getting my ticket numbers down after that week, but honestly I wouldn't have gotten it done as quickly without that interaction",33,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF02B040>
26,Total Grandma type,"So this is a short and sweet story, but I love spreading positivity. So, I get an email ticket from one of our users yesterday, very brief. No body, subject just reads ""VPN"". I email back, asking for more information, asking for error messages, things like that. I get a reply, once again with no information, just reading ""Broken"". Great, one of ""those"" types. The one's who are so impatient that it isn't worth their time to write proper emails

So, I call the number in their signature, and brace myself for the shortness, rudeness, impatient-ness, etc. he user answers the call, with the sweetest old lady voice you could imagine. 

""Hello, this is [username]."" ""Hello [username] this is u/nwojdak with [COMPANY NAME]. How are you today?"" ""Oh hello u/nwojdak! I am doing much better now that you are calling. Do you think you can fix my problem?"" I was surprised. Been a while since I've heard that much sweetness. ""Well, I'll certainly try. Can I jump on your computer to take a look?"" ""Absolutely! Please do! Do whatever you need to! ""I hop on and start taking a look at the issue. ""Goodness, I can't believe how fast you're going! You IT guys always impress me with how smart you are! Especially compared to stupid people like me."" Hearing her put herself down like that broke my heart. ""Hey now..."" I say. ""We don't use words like that. I just have experience. If you guys didn't need help, I wouldn't have a job. It's not your job to know how to fix this."" 

A few minutes later, I solve the issue and get her working properly. ""You're already finished!?"" ""Yes ma'am, I've seen this issue before, so I knew how to resolve it."" I can practically hear the smile in her voice. ""I am so glad you guys do our IT now. Our last IT provider was horrible, always rude and took so long to get back. Thank you so much u/nwojdak, you've been a really big help!!"" Lady, you're gonna give me a cavity.

The next day I got a review back from her, as my company sends out automated reviews once a ticket is closed. The review was marked ""Overwhelmingly positive"" and the text read ""My new best friend u/nwojdak got the issue fixed lickety split. Fast, friendly service. That's why I love [COMPANY NAME]. Keep it up!"" 

I'm still riding the high off of that call, and I wanted to share, as it is experiences like this that remind me *why* I do this job.

27,How can you mess this up?,"I’m a teacher. I’m good with tech because I like to try new things.

They asked me to help because when it comes to actually using most software programs (and all google for education programs) even our school IT will sometimes call me. 

I opened excel and opened the file just fine that way. Coworker thought I was going to copy and paste the data. Nope, opens just fine when you use the correct program.

28,Layers like an onion (an ergonomic nightmare),"So the ticket that came in was from our VP of Finance. He's a nice guy, looks like a cross between Bill Nye and Jimmy Stewart right down to the bow tie, but is counted among the clueless.

Ticket said: My keyboard is typing backwards, please help.

All I could think off the bat was that he had managed to somehow enable u+202e but that was unlikely. Since he was C level I went deskside ASAP.

I can't really explain how he ended up like this, but his laptop was placed on top of his courier bag, which was itself sitting on top of two binders and a large book. I didn't ask but it was clearly to make an impromptu standing desk.

This is odd, because he already had an adjustable desk. Every office and most of the cubes had them.

I step up to the laptop and try to type something, he was stuck at the login screen so options were limited. Sure enough you'd type a character and the cursor would be at the left of it, not the right. The cursor was also flashing a lot faster than usual.

Searching around the desk, I found a few more binders leaning against the wall. Behind them was an external keyboard, connected to a docking station, with the corner of a binder pressing ever-so-gently against the left arrow key. Moved binder, issue resolved.

Naturally I had a few questions. These were the answers:

He didn't use the external keyboard because the desktop was too low to use while standing. He raised the laptop so he could type properly and still see the screen.

The adjustable desk wasn't working (plugged into its own onboard power strip somehow) and when he raised the laptop his two external monitors were too low so he didn't use them.

He was absolutely certain that I couldn't fix the desk (plugged it into the wall and reset the controls - easy) and argued his solution was better pretty much up until I convinced him to at least try the new (correct) setup. Raised the desk, removed the pile of stuff, set up his laptop, external keyboard and mouse, arranged it so he could see all 3 screens, and made one of the 27"" monitors the main.

Again, this guy is not entitled or even unreasonable, he just has the technical acumen of a turnip. He's amazing at his job, but had to be taught how to forward an email. So when it's properly demonstrated that he can have his bigger keyboard, bigger monitors, standing desk, etc. all at the same time he's over the moon. Tells the other execs how I (gasp) fixed his desk, so that's good.

I kept my yap shut because there was literally no way to relay what happened without making him look incompetent, and wrote it up as ""foreign object pressing against left arrow key"" with no elaboration on specifics.

It's the chain of events that got me. Desk never worked because it was plugged into itself and was set up for a sitting desk arrangement. (That one's on whoever set up the office for him - we're supposed to wire any desktop items to the onboard power strip so the desk can move safely.) User wanted a standing desk but never once mentioned it to the Help Desk or the head of IT, who he met with weekly at least. He made a precarious pile of random stuff in his office (bag was far from flat and the binders slid against each other, he was adjusting it constantly because it moved while typing) and abandoned the two really nice monitors he had rather than sit in his chair. Finally, he moved his mouse and keyboard aside since they were in the way of his new setup and over time stacked binders until the issue occurred.",85,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF02B820>
29,The ultimate bandaid,"So this is from within the last 10 years. I was an intern for a government organization at the state level. We had an issue with the network going down every morning. It was tied down to a server that was freezing up every morning. We had a pretty large department with its own dedicated network team and all so quick fix right?

Oh no no no this was a government job, band aid fixes all around...rather than find the source of the issue the network team nominated a guy we will call James (can't remember his actual name) to come in every morning at 6 am, clock in, restart the server, them take a nap until everyone else arrived.

It worked and this happened for like a month or 2 before management started asking questions like ""why are we paying James so much over time?"" ""Why is there a sleeping bag in the office?"" And ""did I just see James getting dressed in the break room....is he sleeping here, oh God is he living out of the office?!?!""

If it wasn't for that last question I'm pretty sure they would have kept that bandaid on for years instead of just fixing the issue which they hammered out within days of James being called in on suspicion of living in the office. In fact I think it was fixed same day after that.",31,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF00C850>
30,"""Save your work, the server's on fire""","Many years ago, pre my IT days, I was doing a business administration course and one day someone I didn't really know popped their head round the door and said ""Save your work, the server's on fire"".  Oddly enough, as the only person who saved their work to a floppy disk in the 90 odd seconds before the fire alarm went off, when we returned a few days later, I was the only person who still had the data from that day.  The guy who a) told us to save the work to something that was on fire and b) didn't bother with minor little details like the fire alarm was no-where to be seen.  

Yes, in retrospect we obviously should have just got out and not saved anything but... particularly when you're younger and less cynical, if you're told there's an emergency and to do something quickly, you just do it.  Also, even when I thought about it, I thought it would either be a remote server (rare as they were for small places in the 90s) or at least in an outbuilding.  Nope.

31,Power loss times two,"[This](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/tgew0x/testing_the_ups) power-related post reminded me of a certain server at work a few years ago. 

I was working as a developer/sysadmin with my job defacto being internal tech support and making sure development, deployment and running of code  went smooth (though I hesitate to call it CI/CD in the current implied meaning of the word).

The server site relevant to this story was at the time undergoing construction work and we frequently had to cut power to different server rooms. Hardly ever an issue, the UPS's would kick in and for longer outages we brought external power.

On one scheduled outage a late evening I get a call about the UPS in the server room failing to deliver any power and all equipment in the room had some unexpected downtime.* It actually brought the bulk of the company down with it because of the network layout.

Despite this I and the on site technician could get  most of the functionality back up and running within 15 minutes and all of it except an old server running development and test VM's was running, error checked and functionality tested within 45 minutes. Somewhat of a feat considering the technical debt that site had.

I figured the test server could wait until next day and didn't bother to check it after booting it. No company crucial service was running on it. No one except me was going to work on it that week. Some of the services on it should already have started together with the machine and for the rest I would just need to log on and start them manually. Besides it had been without power during another UPS failure some 6 months prior without any issues getting it up and running.

Next day I log onto the test server. No VM on it is running. Very strange. At least some of them should have started automatically. Check logs, they have a handful of messages saying that the processor model isn't supported and the VM's failed to start. Yet saying on the next logged row that the processor is supported.

Hours of troubleshooting later I have read all relevant documentation I could find, read all relevant forum/bug report threads I could find with Google (it was like two), had verified no surprise updates had been installed, had went through all available backups for meaningful changes and checked for hardware failures. All hardware worked I couldn't see any setting or configuration on the server that had changed from before the crash.

This wasn't good. Sure, the server wasn't required to keep the business running but it was part of some CI/CD flows and had test servers we ran demos from. If I couldn't fix it within the week we would risk having to postpone code deployment and customer demos. My stress level approached 11 as my plan for the week derailed.

Out of the blue my boss gave me a number to call some friend of his. The friend was initially just as bamboozled as I was but later said that one of the warnings could be a side effect related to a BIOS setting on some server motherboards. Then it clicked for us: The motherboard battery had drained and the BIOS reset to factory defaults.

A battery change and an obscure BIOS checkbox later the VM's are up and running as if nothing had ever happened.

---

*Never found out why the UPS never kicked in, but I later got the warning saying it had started to deliver power when planned outage started.",24,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF00CE80>
32,Old Time Tale,"Circa 1994.

Panicked phone call from the help desk.  ""No one can access the system""  great, let me head down to the server room and check everything out.  This was a 500 person law firm with 8 25 port mini computers.  All 25 ports of each server was connected to a Micom RS232 switch.  The Micom allowed users to connect from their dumb terminals to an open port on any of the servers.  Note that all the dumb terminals were hard wired via RS232 ports to concentrators on each floor of the building.

I take a look, and the Micom config is blown, as in factory reset.  So as I begin the process of restoring the config, at 300 baud if I remember correctly, it comes out that a DEC tech was in the server room, pulled a floor tile looking for power, and randomly pulled a power cable to plug his equipment into.  His excuse was ""it sounded like just a fan"".  4 hours later, the Micom config is reloaded, turns out the battery on the main controller board had failed, causing the config to be lost when the power was pulled.

DEC got a bill from the firm for the $100,000/hr downtime the tech caused.",28,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF00C0D0>
33,"Let's get our users to learn how to save space (but, maybe not us)","This is from about 25 years ago. I worked in an IT department that supported a division of our company. At the time, we were still rolling out desktop computers to people; some departments just had a central terminal they used to login to a VAX for e-mail and certain applications.

One of the things we discovered was that folks getting a personal computer often didn't think about deleting stuff. They would just keep saving files, or making copies, and didn't have any awareness about the limits of disk space and such. As I was involved in our helpdesk, and could put together some simple web sites, I was asked to work with someone on developing a web site to teach people about how to reduce their use of space-eating things like e-mails, files, personal stuff, and so on.

We came up with a sort of film-noir detective concept, only he figured out space-wasting capers. We had different ""adventures"" that were written as the denouement of each story, and each story related to a specific concept, like knowing record-retention guidelines, or how to check the amount of data used in a directory or your e-mail. They would have multiple choice answers to reaffirm the concept; picking the right one let you leave your employee number so you could participate in a prize drawing.

Management was really excited about this, and said we should take a snapshot of how much space was used on our servers before we sent this out, and a week after. We would have a random drawing to give out gift certificates to the cafeteria, so everything got set up.

It was cool seeing the information come in as the number of visits increased, and people were talking about the little stories and the character we'd made up.

After the week was over, we talked to the system operators to get the size snapshot...and data storage was *much greater* than it had been before we started!

It turned out that the manager of our organization decided to share a bunch of scanned pictures from a Halloween party we'd had recently, and he'd attached the files and used everyone's name as an individual, instead of a group distribution list (one of the techniques we had a story about).

34,Testing the UPS,"Reminded by this post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/sxvxm2/a\_rapid\_descent\_into\_noc\_hell/](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/sxvxm2/a_rapid_descent_into_noc_hell/)  


So, back in the before times, in the runup to Y2K, I worked for a call center in SoCal.  I had been part of the crew that was going around to each of our 1000+ workstations and confirming or patching the BIOS to stave off the Y2K bug.  Our largest client, still a world leader in telecom, was rightfully paranoid about crashes general call availability.  To this end, they wanted confirmation we were ready for all the potential disasters Y2K would bring.  


As part of that, we tested our UPS system several times.  We had several banks of batteries for the servers and network infrastructure, but these were rated for only about 15 minutes of power, while the backup generator kicked off.  It took 5 or 6 minutes for the generators to come up to operating temperature and be ready for the load they were intended to handle.  The first time we ran it, there was a mechanical failure, and the genset didn't get up before the batteries faded.  The 2nd time, we found a wiring fault, and not all the server racks were wired to the genset.

Third test worked great, everything went as planned.  4th test was done in front of the client reps, on a weekend.  After that we did a full up live test in the middle of week in front of the client's regional VP's.  That was an extended run, lasting most of my shift.  

Y2K came, and by this time I was promoted to a floor supervisor.  All hands on deck on NYE, 1999, just in case the apocalypse happened.  It didn't, we all let out a collective sigh of relief, and we went on with our lives.  


Until March 5th 2000, when Southwest Airlines flight 1455 overran the Burbank airport runway, rolled across the street, and knocked down some power lines.  


We lost power, but the batteries kicked on, genset came up, and our employees restarted their workstations without dropping a call.  All planned for, smooth transition.  


Until about 15 minutes later, when the gensets spun down.  People started scratching their heads, and then about 5 minutes later the servers started shutting down from loss of battery power.

Apparently after all the testing we did in the prep for Y2K, no one thought to refill the fuel tanks for the generators.  Oops.",86,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF00C280>
35,The Network is down….and you’re on KP?,"Here comes another one of my split tech support/military stories. So I will write it for both sub reddits. This is another long one, so buckle up.  
   
This takes place BEFORE my now infamous [Dressing Down the Commanding General](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/t9puc0/i_dressed_down_the_commanding_general/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) post. 

$Me: Again – the lowly specialist who is expected – along with the rest of his squad – to pull miracles off just using baling wire, duct tape, bubble gum, and no budget. 

$My Squad – my miracle working compadres. You give us a paper clip and a tin can, we could get free satellite TV for you. 

$CPT-O: “CPT Opie” - Our inside affectionate name for my section’s (G6) Captain because he looked just like Opie from the Andy Griffith Show with his fire red hair and freckles. He knew we called him this, and was cool with it.

$LTC: The Lieutenant Colonel of our section. (G6) $CPT Opie’s boss. 

$COL: Chief of Staff of my Division. Rank of Full Bird Colonel. $LTC’s boss. He was a former Airborne Ranger. Very intimidating man, about 6 1/2 ft tall. You DID NOT mess with this guy, but he always respected his troops.

$MG: DIVISION General – 2 Star General. EVERYONE’S BOSS. The only person he answered to was either the 4-Star Adjutant General, or the Governor of the State. 

As many of you know (especially my military brothers and sisters) – we National Guard types do the “1 weekend a month, 2 weeks a year.”

This story takes place during the “2 weeks a year” time, also known as “annual training.”

So – switching over to the Tech Side, all of my tech brothers and sisters out there know the difference between “Hot,” “warm,” and “COLD” Sites. 

I will not detail out everything between the types of sites, but in short, a HOT site is one that you can immediately fall in on, and resume operations. While a COLD SITE HAS NOTHING, completely and totally vacant… barely power. 

We were given the mission to bring a HUGE building from cold to hot. This building was COLD, we are talking about Antarctic, Siberian winter cold. You could replace the dust with snow. 

There was nothing there. Not a stitch of networking cables, no ports, barely any power. We were lucky to have floors and a roof and ceilings. 

Bringing up a network from scratch, while enjoying to me, IS A PAIN. We ended up running the equivalent of about 20 miles worth of CAT5 cable. That is not an exaggeration. We also had to put in the ports, crimp all the cables, setup all the servers. (The servers are another story, trust me that’s a good one too, I’ll post that in another post.) 

The days WERE LONG…16-18 hours long.  We were using every geek trick in the book while staying within regulation (AR 25-2) – even using the old “tennis ball and string trick” to pull the cable.

Then the problem came up that the TELCO company was having a problem getting the T1 connection out there, and while we had everything wired (although loosely, but within regulation) – we could not make communications back to headquarters, and VPN back into the military network.  

We tried to get everything ready for the incoming connection from the TELCO, but without Internet, we couldn’t get updates, etc. Basically, the entire network – that all of us worked so hard on -  was basically  bricked.

I am a night owl, and one late night, $CPT-O approaches me as I am doing some configurations (with the current image) on some of the servers. I was about to hit the rack, though. 

$CPT-O: Specialist OP? 

$Me: (I Lock up) Yes sir?

$CPT-O: At ease…. (I relax) How do you think the network is coming along?

$Me: Well – we are still trying to get the main connection in, but overall, I think we are good once we get the main connection in. Just have to configure some things to communicate back to HQ. But I am sure me and the rest of the squad will get it knocked out soon. 

$CPT-O: (kinda sheepishly) Specialist OP, $LTC received the duty roster for tomorrow, and you are to report for KP duty in the morning, I’m sorry to tell you this, but there’s nothing I can do. 

Sidenote for my civilians: KP is one of the most useless and degrading duties assigned. I know many people have the image of someone peeling potatoes, but that disappeared a long time ago. It was just the timing of all of this. 

$Me: Sir, with respect! You know that we are not at full capacity yet! Can’t you talk to the $LTC? I know main connection is not in, but there are other internal things that we need to do…print servers…making sure DHCP is running…user accounts… things like that. 

$CPT-O: I tried, OP. I know this puts us all in a difficult spot, but I am sure we can get it done. As you said, the main connection is not in yet anyway. 

$Me: (begrudgingly) Yes, sir……..understood. 

I being one of the few that were allowed to have their POV (privately owned vehicle), I drove back to the barracks/hooch. I run into the two fellow members of the senior tech team. (They were night owls too) They knew I was either tired or pissed off… or a combination of both.

My Corporal: OP… you ok?

SPC 1: Yeah OP – you look pissed.

$Me: (just venting) Well – guess what? I am f-ing assigned to KP tomorrow, while we still have a network to get online. 

The Corporal and my fellow Specialist’s jaws just drop. And say: “WHISKEY TANGO FOXTROT??” (Used the other words though)

$Me: I know, and I pleaded with $CPT-O to get me relieved, but he said that it came straight from the $LTC.

They WERE NOT HAPPY. 

I try to get some sleep, with my clock being completely thrown off. 

So at about 4 a.m. (0400) I report the chow hall/DFAC and start setting up.

I dutifully go throughout the day: Wiping tables, emptying trash bags, etc. Nothing really of note happened, other than my absolute boredom, and constantly thinking about the network I needed to get going.  

By the time dinner chow rolls around (5-6 p.m \[1700-1800\]), I am just exhausted. I am covered in food, the hall is hot, I’m dripping in sweat, and I have just been wiping tables and taking out trash all day while my network is down. Yes, I was on the food line for a little bit. All I was thinking about was the network. (Yes, I was subnetting in my head… you geeks will get that) 

Just so happens that I was assigned to set up the head table for the $MG, and $COL/COS plus the rest of the upper staff. The $MG was a peanut butter FREAK. He loved those little peanut butter packs we got in MRE’s or if we had some at the sidebar. I put a side tray at the head table. (Yes, this plays a part)

I continue going about my duties. All of a sudden, I hear from behind me, in a very stern voice:

“Specialist OP!”

I whip around and there standing before me is $COL, he was right behind the $MG. I put down my bottle and rag and lock up.

$Me: “Yes,Sir!”

$COL: **“WHO…DID…YOU…KILL?”**

$Me: Sir?

$COL: Why are you are here, when the network is not up yet?

$Me: Sir, I was told to report here for this duty by $CPT-O….

$COL: When did this happen?

$Me: Sir, last night after we had been pulling cable. I was working on getting the servers running at least internally, and $CPT-O informed me I had to report here.

$COL: Did $LTC know about this?

$Me: Yes, sir. She was the one that told him.

At this point, even the $MG was having this “WTF?” look on his face.

$COL: (A very pissed off look on his face) Ok.. OP…Carry on.

They continue to proceed through the chow line, and they were having chatter that I was not privy to.

Since I had setup the head table, I was the unofficial “waiter,” and – to be honest – a perfect opportunity to suck up. (Hey, we all do it.. admit it.) 

So I finish up my current table, and I just happen to notice that the $MG and $COL with the rest of the senior staff had sat down. ($LTC was not there.) Seizing the opportunity, I went to the table to make sure that they had everything they needed. 

$Me: Gentlemen, is everything ok here?

All at table: “Yes….Specialist… thank you…”

$Me: (with a smile on my face) $MG, is enough peanut butter there for you, sir? 

$MG: YES, Specialist! Thank you. How did you know?

$Me: (with a smile) I have good connections within the G2 (military intelligence). \[This of course was a total joke, someone on the kitchen crew had told me\]

$MG: Specialist, always keep in mind, I’M A PEANUT BUTTER MADMAN. 

$Me: Yes sir!

The $COL was just sitting there with a really pissed off look on his face.

I continue on, trying to get this hell of a day over with. 

I was cycling back around to the head table, and all of sudden $COL busts out with, IN A VERY LOUD VOICE:

“I DON’T UNDERSTAND WHY $LTC HAS ONE OF MY BEST NETWORK ADMINS ON KP WHEN WE CAN’T DO SHIT OVER THERE RIGHT NOW. WE NEED OUR NETWORK UP! OP DOESN’T NEED TO BE HERE! ”

$Me (internally): “*Oh God…..I’m in trouble…..*”

$MG: $COL, don’t worry, I’m sure our boys will get it fixed, we have the best in “the 6.”

$COL: Well, one of our best shouldn’t be here right now. 

I was just thinking… “Oh God…. What’s next?”

The day finally ends, and I am just exhausted, but it was one of those weird exhaustion points. You know…. when you are so tired…that you are wired wide awake?  

After my KP duty shift, I was curious as to what the rest of the team had done during the day. (Remember, this is before everyone had cell phones and texting ability.)

I drove up to the building to just to take a look at the server rack, and see what the squad had done. Masochistic, I know, but I just wanted to know how my “babies” (servers) were doing. 

So I drag my bedraggled butt into the building. I smell… I’m tired… I need a shower REALLY bad, and just wanted to see the status of the network that I would partially be in charge of.

As I am looking, I hear from behind me.

“Specialist OP…”

I turn around and to my surprise, it was $CPT-O. It was REALLY late for even him to be there. 

$Me: Sir?

$CPT-O: First off, what are you doing here? You should be in the rack. 

$Me: I know sir, but I just wanted to see what the guys did today so I know where to pick up tomorrow. 

SCPT-O: OK, did you say anything to $COL today?

$Me: Sir, he asked me why I was there. I told him the truth: I was put on the duty roster for today. That’s all I said, but I did make sure that the $MG had his peanut butter though. (slight, tired smile)

$CPT-O: Well…whatever you said made a huge difference.

$Me: (bewildered look) “Sir?”

(Now, I want it clear that what I am about to reveal is 2nd hand information from $CPT-O…and this is his recollection of it, as I was still busy wiping down tables when this allegedly happened, but he was usually pretty accurate.) 

$CPT-O: I was talking to $LTC when then $COL walked in, we stood up,  but **he did not say “As you were.”** 

(Note for civilians: It is customary that when a superior officer enters into a room, you come to attention, and typically, and they will say “As you were” or “At ease.” This apparently – in this case – did not happen.)

$CPT-O: He really dressed down $LTC. Wondering why with the network down that you ($Me) were on KP, and about a few other issues regarding to the network. He was not a happy man. He was pissed off. 

I felt myself turning white.

$Me: Sir, I didn’t mean any trouble, but when you have the $COL AND $MG talking to you, you just have to be honest. 

$CPT-O: Relax OP. Whatever you did, intentional or not…worked.

$Me: (bewildered look on my face) Sir?

**$CPT-O proceeds to inform me that the G6 – AS PER THE $COL (and probably the $MG) – were exempted from all other duties, especially KP, for the rest of the mission.**

$Me: (about to collapse from exhaustion) You think it was the peanut butter, sir?

$CPT-O: (laughing) Go hit the rack, OP. You can come in late tomorrow. Go get some rest.

I went to the hooch/barracks and just scalded myself in some of the hottest water I have ever felt. I barely dressed, and just racked out. I return to duty around 10:00 the next morning. 

My squad thanked me for taking one for the team, and I did get an AAM (Army Achievement Medal) for that time in the field.",18,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF00C1F0>
36,Wedding reception call,"Happen about 7 years ago. I was no longer help desk but in an system admin role within the same company. Habits are hard to quit for some people so I am often reached out to like a tier 1 help desk. 

It was Sunday, the office was closed and my fiancé, parents and some other family members were checking out a venue for our upcoming wedding. I dropped everyone off and drove off looking for a parking spot. As I circle around looking intently for parking, my phone rings. Since I am on the hunt for a free spot I pick it up without looking figuring it was someone I dropped off spotting a parking space. It wasn't. It was the CEO of my company with email issues on his Mac. I screwed myself. If I looked at the caller ID saw it was him and ignored it, he would of tried calling another team member or my boss etc. Because I picked up I am stuck. I now have to help. The issue was his gigantic email database on his Mac was corrupt and needed to be repaired. 

So as I am meeting with the venue manager seeing all the areas of the venue and going over the potential setup of our wedding reception cocktail hour etc. etc., I am walking the CEO through how to repair his database. Painful to do on the phone and with him. I get him to the point where we have to wait an extremely long time for the database repaired. I thinking great let this run and I will call him back. NOPE. He asked 100 questions. How long is this going to be? Will I have all my email? How can I do work email while this is going on etc. etc. I tried getting off the phone with him for 20 minutes but he kept coming with the questions. I got off the phone and reached out to another team member to call the CEO and check on the repair. It took hours. 

The CEO used webmail while it was being repaired. I did see the venue and liked it. My fiancé was understanding.  It was the venue we picked in the end lol.

37,It's 2AM,"**Back Story**

This happened more than 10 years ago. During summer, my uncles got my grandmother a new-to-her computer, which she didn't want to use. I pried and she said that she was too old to use a computer. I disagreed. I showed her some basic computer tasks, like how to turn it on, using the mouse and keyboard, how to get logged on to the internet, some basic internet safety, shortcuts to news sites, and other ""simple for us, but hard for them"" tasks. She was most excited that she could read the news any time, not just when it came on the TV. She took a computer class a few weeks after I had returned home to learn more of what it can do. It is important to mention that she lives in a different time zone, but has always been mindful of this when calling. 

**Story**

After a long night of test prep, I go to sleep, exhausted. I'm REMing hard, when my polyphonic barphone goes off (that thing was loud). It took several seconds to pull me out of sleep, but I looked at the calling number and the time. It's from her area code. Now, that part of the family never calls at these hours, unless there's an emergency. Armed with this knowledge, I perk up and answer the phone. 

Me: (nervous) Hello?

Grandma: (as happy as could be) I sent you an email!

Me: (confused) What? Grandma?

Grandma: Yes, I sent you an email! I figured it out! Did you get??

Me: (SOO glad it's not an emergency) It's 2 in the morning, what--

Grandma: No, I did the math. It's 2 in the afternoon. Did you get my email??

I decided to turn on my tower and log on. Indeed, I see an email from her. 

Me: I do see an email from you! That's so cool! Now I can email you any time! 

Grandma: Well... I hope I can figure out how to write one back! You really got it??

Me: (chuckled) I did! 

Grandma: Thanks for showing me that I'm not too old use the computer! I have to call your mother! I sent her one, too!

Me: You're very welcome! But, grandma, it *is* actually 2 in the morning here. Maybe wait a few hours before calling her?

Grandma: Oh, OK, yeah. Sorry I must have done the math wrong. 

Me: Don't apologize, I'm glad you called!

We hung up shortly after. She did end up calling my mom... At 6:30 AM. I guess she couldn't wait any longer.

Edit: She lives in a different country, so my midnight is her morning. She usually calls in her evening, so she's used to catching us in our afternoons. In class the next day, the professor noticed I was unusually tired and confronted me. I told her a summary of my night and she allowed me to retake the test. I thanked her, but franky, I was fine with the less-than-perfect (but passing) grade I got. I am enormously proud, to this day, of my grandma for being able to email on her own and I would never give up that 2am call. She's had to stop using her computer, due to her legally blind status (over 80% blind) :(",74,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF00C100>
38,The equipment operator thought he was as qualified as me to make repairs,"I work in a small company where we make these widgets. The widgets are coated in a substance that must be cured by heat. Ordinarily, this substance is applied by “soaking” the parts in an oven to heat them, dipping the parts in the coating, then “soaking” the parts in an oven one more time to “cure” the coating.

Instead, we heat the parts by running an electric current through them. We use modified welders to do this. Much of the equipment was built or modified by me, based on designs by the previous employee. I would like to think I have improved upon his designs—for example, where he used wire wrapping to assemble a circuit board, I used solder. Wire wrapping was a method for prototyping circuit boards “back in the day,” but isn’t used much any more—and it wasn’t meant to be a permanent solution as the wire-wrapped connections can oxidize over time and cause intermittent faults.

I don’t actually work in the coating room where the widgets get dipped in the coating and then cured. I maintain the equipment (the boxes of electronics that interface between the computers and the rest of the equipment, the mechanisms that dip the parts, and the welders that heat the parts). The operator of the coating room is expected, with training and experience, to understand what “times” to enter into the computer that operates the mechanisms that dip and heat the parts. 

On to the story. The gentleman that is the operator in our coating room has come to believe he knows at least as much as I do about how the equipment functions. He has become quite knowledgeable about what times to enter into the computer as the operations progress throughout the day—*I do not have such knowledge*, as when I’m not doing repairs in the coating room, I have my own equipment to run and maintain (I troubleshoot problems all over the company, and I’m also the “gopher” for our IT contractor). When the coating room operator has a problem with the equipment, he calls me, I look it over, I suggest how to troubleshoot & fix it, and I make the repair.

Recently, he’s complained that one of the welders that applies the current to heat the parts as they are being dipped is producing unsatisfactory results. I advised him that, when convenient for him, we should troubleshoot the issue by swapping the welder with one of the other three (there are two workstations, each workstation has two welders, one each for heating the parts as they are dipped and heating the parts a second time as the coating is cured). I  said that the equipment had been designed such that the welders could be swapped easily—that is, once you unplug a welder from the electrical outlet, you only need to unplug a single control cable from the back of the welder before you could move it to the other workstation. I had hoped to confirm that the problem either followed the welder—or did not. This would either isolate the problem to the welder or lead us to something else, such as the dipping mechanism or the system that circulates the substance that is used to coat the parts.

Remember how I said the operator has come to believe he knows at least as much as I do about how the equipment functions because he has become quite knowledgeable about what times to enter into the computer as the operations progress throughout the day? Without my knowledge or consent, he brought in some tools from home and began *disassembling* two of the welders. He could have just unplugged both power and control cables from the welders prior to swapping them, but he disassembled them. Breaking control cables. Ruining one of the solenoids that control when the current flows. Leaving the high-current connections for the solenoids on both welders *loose*. 

I didn’t learn what was happening until hours later, after he was forced to admit defeat. He left one welder where the solenoid was unable to turn the welder on. He left the other welder where the solenoid was unable to turn the welder *off*, an unbelievably hazardous situation. I actually saw sparks jumping across a connection that was not supposed to have current flowing through it at the time.

I’ve managed to repair one of the welders, returning one of the two workstations to service. It’s going to be a few days before I can repair the other welder. The solenoid that was unable to turn its welder off has a cracked case and a missing terminal for one of the two control wires (the operator just shoved the remains of the lug at the end of the wire against the remains of the terminal), so I’ve had to order a replacement solenoid. And I *still* have to troubleshoot the operator’s original complaint after I’m finished repairing the second welder.",114,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF00C370>
39,"Let's chat about your repair, shall we...?"," 

One of the banes of every TV repairman's existence is the amateur. There was a survey done while I was in the business that stated that TV repairmen were the second least trusted professionals, just ahead of used car salesmen, and I can understand why. In any business that requires specialized knowledge there are always those jerks that use their knowledge to cheat people. My boss didn't stand for that, however, believing (correctly) that it would be far more profitable to simply make sure your customers knew they could trust you. Still, the stigma led many to try to fix their sets themselves, or call the ""expert friend"" who would come over, happy to share his vast knowledge to the wonderment of all. Usually in the very early days that vast knowledge consisted of taking tubes to the local drugstore to the ""U Test Em"" Tube tester (""Tubes Sold Here!) in an attempt to find the ""bad"" one. What they didn't know was that the tester in the drug store was a bit schizophrenic: if it told you the tube was bad - it was bad, but if it told you the tube was good.... well, it might be lying to you...  


With the advent of ""solid state"" electronics and transistorized circuits a lot of this fell by the wayside, but there was alway the guy who thought they could save some money by trying to fix it themselves. Doing so could be compared to do-it-yourself dentistry: you might get lucky, but more than likely you're not going to like the results. There was, however, one part that even the most unknowledgeable amateur always felt sure they could replace with impunity: a fuse.

Now, let's start with one important concept: fuses generally don't ""go bad"". The number of times I've heard ""it's a bad fuse"" from the uninitiated could, if transformed to dimes, buy me an unending supply of overpriced coffee. When any other part stops working, it might be bad: when a fuse blows, it's not ""going bad"" - it's working as designed, protecting the circuit behind it from an overvoltage/current situation that would ruin far more expensive circuitry and render the set well and truly dead. You can replace a fuse with the EXACT replacement maybe once, but if it still blows you need to get your equipment to a pro. Trying too many times can result in acrid smells accompanied by smoke and cracking sounds. This is considered a Bad Thing. Still, there is always that one guy who is sure he knows better...

Which brings us to the guy who brought in a small portable color TV. He was really annoying and unreasonable - demanding, talking down to me and my colleagues, expecting special treatment and super-quick turnaround - just being an entitled jerk. It was good to watch him walk out the door. I put it on my section of the bench and began taking the back off. The set was one of the well and truly dead, and when I opened it up I found that the entire power supply and horizontal output section were burnt to a crisp. Normally in this model there would be a fuse to protect all of this, but upon looking I found that the user had attempted his own fix by wrapping the fuse in tinfoil. With no fuse to protect them this caused the set to do its best imitation of an Independence Day Barbecue, complete with the aforementioned smoke and acrid smell. The protected circuits were very literally toast. As I have insinuated thus far, the first commandment of retail electronics is ""Thou shalt have no other technicians before ME"" , and for this very reason.

It was not going to be cheap to put his set back together. He was not happy with the price and made a number of disparaging comments over the phone when we called in his estimate, but he really had no choice and agreed to the repair. Finally the day came for him to pick it up, and I happened to be on the counter when he came in. He was loudly complaining about the price ""just to replace a few parts!"" the whole time I was retrieving his set. By the time I set it on the counter my patience was gone: I had resurrected his TV from the dead and he was complaining. My mischievous side came out.

I leaned over the counter and started speaking, conspiratorially ""Hey,  I noticed you had someone else work on it before we got it. I would be very careful and not go to that guy again. Do you know what he DID? He wrapped a fuse in tinfoil! That's what caused the damage. Can you imagine anyone being that STUPID? I can't imagine what he was THINKING!"" I was laying it on heavy, pretty much calling him every word for 'foolish' in the book  and all he could do was stand there, listen and nod... there was no way he was going to fess up and admit that he was the guy with the tinfoil. I finished my comments with a smile. He was silent as he quickly paid and left the shop as fast as he could. It was always rare when I could feel like I'd managed to get a little of my own back and I have to admit that it was the highpoint of my week. ",121,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF00C3D0>
40,PHD needs to be rebooted,"I was working IT support on a large military base.  The section I was assigned to had many important people in it (people with lots of horsepower, let's say).  One of my customers held multiple PHDs and was reportedly the highest paid VIP in the building.   He spent all day every day doing research on his computer.  He'd been doing similar work for about a decade.  One day, he calls me to ask me to come to his office as he's having a problem with his Windows 10 workstation.  So I walk into his office and ask him what the issue is.  He starts describing what is a very common problem that I've seen thousands of times, and is always solved instantly by rebooting the workstation.  So I tell him to reboot his workstation.  He looks at me like I've got three heads and just mutters, ""HUH?"".  So I tell him to restart his computer.  He starts frantically clicking around various spots on the desktop, nowhere near a start button or any icon.  It finally dawns on me...this incredibly over-educated guy earning more in a year than I earn in 10 years has no idea how to use a windows computer, even though that's literally what he's over-paid to do...

41,Fileserver down.,"This happend last year. Around autum.

I was having our weekly afternoon meeting with other staff from administration at friday. Some coffee and bagels and chitchat about office stuff and so on.

I a middle of interesting story about co-workes cat, my phone informed me that I got new mail.

Of course I check it out like proper smartphone addict has to.

Message is from our recycle centers project manager. She states in the message that she can't access the file server. It is friday and I am about to head home after the meeting to waste my weekend by sleeping and gaming but decide to call her anyway. 

Me: Hey you. So you can't access your files on server. Can you ask aroudn your office if anyone else has same problem.   
She: Sure thing, Ill call you back soon.

( one minute later...)

She: Nope. No one can access fileserver.  
Me: Shieet. Ok, Ill finish my meeting (coffee) and head there.

I excuse myself from meeting, go to my office and finish my coffee. 

Time to check what the frigging server is about again. The server itself is a Fujitsu primergy. Tower model. It is located in one of the offices recycle center has. And that office is currently not used by anyone so only one who has any business there is me or other it-guys. No one even has keys to that room but me and other IT-guys.  
Server computer it self is on a desk with display, mouse and keyboard and looks alot like desktop computer. They only got that one server, not my choise but theirs. They only gave me money to get one server, one server lisence etc. And that server runs AD, fileserver and print server. Good thing is that there is not that many office workers on that place that use the server so it's not begging to end it's life. And they use cloud mostly for their precious files.   
File server is however needed for some files that are illegal to but into cloud thanks to GDPR. And those files are pretty important and critical apparently. Don't worry. Server has robrust backup system so data is safe even the server would melt. 

I arrive to the ground zero and head straight to the office thinking about possible causes that might made the server go boohoo. 

I go in the officeroom and look at the desk. I see the display, keyboard, mouse, lots of loose cables but not the server. 

?!?!?. My brain skips few beats and I look at the empty spot on the desk and just can't compute this situation. 

I turn and walk to the project managers office. Knock knock. Who's there? Not the server!

Me: Hi. Yeah I figured out what is wrong with your server. It's gone.   
She: ( Clearly did not compute what I just told her ). Huh? What you mean 'gone'?  
Me: Well yeah server is not there.   
She: ( Even more confused looking ) The heck, let me see. 

I walk back to the ""server room"" with PM and she looks the same half empty desk for a while.  
Never noticed how big her eyes are and how pale she is. Or it might have something to do with this mysterious disapearing of their server. 

Then I also notice that the backup device is also missing and tell her that. 

She: Heck. What the heck. Heck. Who, huh....heck.

She pulls out her phone and I tell her that I ll be outside for a nice relaxing smokeytime while she does some oldschool yelling and howling on the phone. Ill let her went it out in peace. 

After few minutes I go back in and into the ""server room"". She is still there looking more relaxed bit still pretty pissed. 

She: Yeah. New it-guy who started today was supposed to pick up his laptop, display, docking station etc from here this morning. It apears that he desided to take the server instead. 

Me: Huh? Heck. Why the heck would he take the server.   
( note that everyone in there uses identical setups of laptop, docking station, display mouse etc. )

She: No idea what so ever. 

Me: Umm where is this dude stationed?  
She: At the computer chopshop.

My turn to freakout silently and die a little from inside. Computer chop shop is the place there where old and sometimes new computer go to die. They get ripped apart, hard drives erased, too old parts thrown into bin and on the way to the last stop before computer heaven.   
And the fact that the backup system is also gone there... oh heck. Both of them. ( got a double backup there just in case ) 

Also there is a joke that if anyone finds something in there that is not bolted into ground it's going for sale asap. And good computers usually sell in minutes they get into shelf in consumer area. 

I sit down and start to compute how can I salvage this. I can feel my brain overheating. 

Then few moments later. Might be 10 minutes or 100 hours. No idea as time froze there.   
The new it-guy walks in with the server tower and his buddy with backup system.   


It-guy: Hi! Hey sorry man. I though this was free to take. It looked like desktop and I don't like laptops that much so I though I would take this as my work computer. 

Me: So... did you do anything to it? Wipe the drives or something?

It-guy: Nope. Did not have time. Was about to do it as a first thing tomorrow morning.

Me: How about the backp systems? They good?

It-guy: Yeah the big one is still as is was. The smaller one is wiped. 

Me: Huh. Ok. then it's all good. There is your work setup on that other desk. Lemme take that server and start putting this thing back online. 

It-guy: Ok. I am so sorry about this. My fault 100%. 

Me: Hey no problemo. Good that I came here today and not next monday. Next monday I would have been all fire and brimstone. 

It-guy. Hehe. Ill see you later. 

Me: Sure thing buddy. Ill keep you posted and informed. 

Then I just put the server back where it belongs and fire it up. And the \*\*\*\*er bluescreens... 

This just can't be casual friday can it. FML. All I wanted was a nice nap after slow uneventfull day at the office. Now I got stupid winblows server bluescreening my face. I restart the server and it starts up just fine. Huh?! But there is a raid error. Apparently one drive is failing. Heck it. Not gonna fix this today. I got spares at my office so Im coming back on monday. 

I head straight to home and take a nap without alarm. I like to live dangerously. 

The new It-guy turned out to be ok. I even give him most of the admin related stuff there now so I don't have to drive there everytime printer is out of paper or something.

&#x200B;

Bonus story: Couple of weeks ago one co-worker came to me and told me that one of the teachers is super angry because the MFD at 3rd floor is broken and had been broken for couple of days now. 

I have no idea about this. No one has put a ticket about it, called or mailed me. Did not know that the device has a problem. So I jump up and run to the 3rd floor where magic never happens. 

I go to the MDF and look at it. There it is. Xerox workcenter MDF. The pain in my arse now. 

Lets see what is the malfunction of this little prick. 

"" Out of resources "" 

That  is what the MDF display says.

Are you kidding me. I pull out the tray and yep, it's empty. I fill the thing and voila. Fixed the ""broken"" MFD once again. FML.

And this was not the first time for this crap and pretty sure it wont be the last.",102,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF00C940>
42,"""Oh no, I skipped those steps""","At work we've got a ticketing system, which we introduced in 2020 as the pandemic was ramping up. My boss made it VERY clear to everyone: No more walk-ups, unless your computer is so broken that you can't put a ticket in.

Most people adhered to that, except one person. Let's call her Sue.

Sue is an older lady and is steadfast in her refusal to learn how to use computers. She's very manipulative when it comes to this. Sometimes she'll lure you into conversation, asking how your weekend was, and use that as a segue into ""oh while I'm here, can you do this for me?"". Other times she'll sit out the front of the office in the shared working space and as you walk past, sigh audibly or mutter, hoping you'll say ""oh, what's wrong Sue?"". Other times she'll just barge on in and look for the first person to make eye contact with her, put her computer down in front of them, blurt out her issue, and get that person to fix it for her. Once she even complimented my computer skills to try and get me to drop my guard and create some folders on her desktop (yes, really)

I'm wise to her shit, and will gladly send her out of the office to put a ticket in, and say we'll ask her to come in only if we need to look at her computer. Often, she'll respond to our instructions with ""oh that didn't work"" so that we have no choice but to ask her to come in because clicking a TeamViewer link is like pulling goddamn teeth.

One day she had put a ticket in for something that was a known issue. I replied with step-by-step instructions which included screenshots with all the buttons you need to click circled. There were 7 steps in total. About 20 minutes later, she came barging in, saying ""those steps didn't work"". Me, being wise to her shit, asked her to sit down and follow those steps again while she was in the office.

Sue then acted flustered, not sure how to switch between the instructions and what she was asked to do (she knew, she just acted dumb), but after a bit of huffing and puffing, she started. About a minute later, she said ""those steps still didn't work"". I asked what step she got up to, and she said step 6. I looked on the screen and saw she had only done steps 1 and 2. I asked her if she'd done steps 3-5, and she said dismissively ""oh no, I skipped those steps"".

Sue had SEVEN steps to follow. Total time to complete these steps would have been 2 minutes at the very most, and she decided to skip THREE ENTIRE STEPS.

I told her to follow the steps again, in their entirety, not skipping a single one, and what do you know? The issue was resolved and she acted surprised!

In her spare time, this woman loves to bake (we know, because she's brought us in food before, to butter us up for a barrage of questions a day or two later), so she knows the importance of following instructions, she just refused to do them this time because she wanted someone else to do it for her.

TL;DR: A woman at work was given step-by-step, with screenshots, instructions to fix her computer, she skipped 3 of them, then complained that our instructions didn't work.",179,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF00C910>
43,"Fine, YOU choose..."," 

Once upon a time there were legendary beings called TV Repairmen. These majestic creatures were often seen coming to the rescue when the Big Box in your house stopped showing moving pictures, making sounds, or any combination of those things. Yours truly was a member of this once proud tribe, now made all but extinct by cheap, throwaway televisions and overly hard to service large screen sets. 

  
Even back then it was often a battle for the TV guy to be considered anything but a crook: people didn't like it when the magic box stopped working, but they REALLY didn't like having to pay someone to fix it. Anyone who has worked in this field for long has a long list of crazy customer stories, and I will be happy to share a few if there is interest, but I will share this one today for my own satisfaction.

  
It is important to understand that there are a myriad of things that can go wrong with a TV set: the sound can be off, distorted, or just sound funny. The picture likewise can be distorted, the colors can be out adjustment, the signal can be weak, or the set may just be dead. The dead ones were by far, the easiest to fis: you had a concrete problem. The biggest headaches came in when the problem wasn't quite so obvious. 

  
Every TV guy knew the complaint, and it made our hearts drop in our chests to hear it: ""It just doesn't look right"".  Or maybe ""The color just isn't right"". These descriptions can be very obvious, like when the weatherman's face is pea green, but they can also often be very, very subjective... a problem in the eye of the beholder. I have worked on many a set and had it looking, to my eye, crystal clear and showroom fresh only to have the customer tell me that it still doesn't 'look right'. That was the case the afternoon of my story.

  
I was at the house of one of our regular customers, a woman who was known for coming up with the most nebulous and hard to diagnose problems. Many, we firmly believe, existed only in her head. Still she persisted in calling us, and on the day in question I found myself seated behind her big console TV trying to find out why it ""didn't look right"". A mirror on a stand in front of the set showed me the results of everything I did, and I had been working on the set for over an hour without being able to successfully make it look ""right"". My knees were hurting, my ego was damaged - I was this customer's favorite and I was failing her. it was getting late in the day, and she was happily sitting in her chair passing judgment on every adjustment. I heard ""better"", ""Worse"", ""no Difference"" - but never that we were done. It was obvious to me that whatever the mysterious thing that she was waiting to see was never going to materialize: the picture was crisp, clear, balanced, and beautiful. Then, in the midst of my p\[reparations for hari-kiri, an idea occurred to me. I was going to let her have some involvement.

  
I still can't believe that I even thought of this, much less that I actually did it: such was the depth of the despair I was feeling. You see, on the old sets with picture tubes, it was possible to adjust the vertical and horizontal picture synchronization. Without going too deep into the techy part, if your picture's vertical sync got out of adjustment, the picture would appear to roll, like a film strip being pulled across a light. The picture would continue to roll until the vertical hold was adjusted. And the control was sitting right in front of me. I started my rather audacious plan.

  
""Ma'am"" I said ""I've got it very close, but I'm going to need your help to get the perfect picture locked in. I'm going to scan through a series of pictures, and when you see one that looks right, let me know so I can lock it in for you"". The lady was kind of excited - she'd never been asked to help before. She leaned in and I very slightly adjusted the vertical hold so the picture started to slowly roll. She watched intently for several frames, and suddenly exclaimed ""There! Stop!... Oooooh, can you go back one..?"" With a happy ""Yes, Ma'am!"" I stopped the roll and carefully let it roll backwards once.

  
""There!'There! That's perfect!"" she exclaimed. I very carefully locked it in, made sure that everything was in order, and put the back of the set back on. My customer was positively bubbling as she signed my service ticket and saw me to the door.  
I left the employment of this particular shop a few months later, moving forward in my telecom career, so I never responded to this lady's house again, but the other tech on the bench at the shop later told me that she was satisfied with that set for a long time. I never had the call to try that again, and my coworker admitted that he never could work up the nerve. I still can't believe that I not only did it - but got away with it.",95,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF00CF40>
44,500$ mainboard DDR 4 compatibility,"So i recently sold my used gigabyte z170x gaming g1 motherboard on ebay and shipped it to sweden. The buyer contacted me a few days later that the motherboard was defective, he was not getting a picture through either the onboard gpu or his external gpu.The error message Error 23 allowed me to narrow it down to a problem with the RAM.  In addition to the usual questions about whether the memory is properly seated and he has already reset the cmos, which he has done everything, I read through the manual of the motherboard. On the productpage I found a compatibility list for the RAM and sent it to him and asked if his memory is listed there. He was using a HyperX Fury 3600 DDR 4 memory which was not listed. He was able to borrow a different stick and boot with it. That was the mistake, this branded memory is not compatible with a $500 motherboard. Hours wasted on troubleshooting for that. This is just a short story but I was fascinated that compatibilityproblems are still around those days.",24,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF00C220>
45,User needs a splitter,"So along with my regular day to day computer technician position I also work in procurement for the IT dept of a large organization.  Yesterday I popped into my email and read a computer equipment request form that had several items listed, such as a headset for zoom meetings, a new mouse, etc.  All low-budget items that we have in stock and would normally be approved right away.  But for the last item on their list they asked for a ""splitter"".  That's it, no other information.  Just a splitter.

So I email them back, asking what kind of splitter they require.  Are they trying to split audio, video, or something else.

Today I got my response, which basically just said ""It's been 24 hours, where's my equipment?""

Sigh.  Thanks for not answering my question.

I notice that they're in the same building as me, so I decide to wander on over and ask them directly what exactly they meant by ""splitter"".

She tells me that she can't plug all of this stuff in at the same time, as there's only one available USB port in the front of her computer.  So she's asking for a splitter so that she can plug more than one item in at a time, such as a headset as well as a webcam for Zoom meetings.

Ah, so a USB hub is what she wants.  But wait a second, what about the USB ports on the back of her computer?

Eventually I get back to my office and approve the equipment request, except for one item.  In the area where I explain why the request was denied I write ""Today I taught a user that there are USB ports on the back of her computer and not just the front.  3 ports available"".",39,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF00C580>
46,Just Hire Zefram Cochrane," Circa 1980 I was working for a time sharing vendor in the US. Access to our computers was via our own dial-up network.  Since most of our customers were in the US and Europe, that’s where our computers were.

One day I got a call from one of our sales reps screaming that his new customer in Australia was complaining about lousy response time.  We had to fix this immediately since this customer was potentially worth thousands of dollars each month.   

Our monitoring software showed that we were consistently meeting our SLA (Service Level Agreement) of 2.5 seconds, so I asked for details. Often bad response time was due to problems with the local telephone service, especially in rural areas.  For all I knew this customer was at a cattle station in the outback.  Nope. The customer was in brand new office building in Perth, just a few blocks from our access point.  

OK, sometimes response time just seems bad, but when you actually measure it, it’s within the SLA. Nope.  This customer was running a script that issued a set of commands and recorded the response time. His numbers showed it was between 1.5 and 2.25 seconds.

So what was he complaining about? And why was he running his own response time monitor?  We charged for connect time and usage, so he was paying for what was in effect an extra user that was signed on all day and running this script.

Except he wasn’t.  And he wasn’t even complaining.  In fact he was delighted.

The salesman was so eager to make the sale that he changed the SLA to guarantee sub-second response time.  Since we weren’t meeting the SLA, we couldn’t bill him.  So this customer was using our service for free.  The salesman was the one complaining since his commission was based on billing. 

I sent him an email explaining that the communications link between Australia and the  US was via a satellite in a geosynchronous orbit about 22,300 miles above the earth.  Since data travels at the speed of light, which is about 186,000 mph, it took more than half a second just to send the command to us and the response back. That leaves us with less than half a second to process it.

In order to meet his SLA we would have to build a computer center in Australia at a cost of about 1 million dollars a month. We both knew that wasn’t going to happen any time soon. He demanded  that I come up with another solution. Preferably before the next billing cycle. 

Every few days the sales rep called me wanting to know if I had a solution.  Finally I said I had. 

All we needed to do was figure out a way to send data faster than the speed of light. Kind of like Warp Drive on Star Trek.  I was sure there were a few Nobel Laureate physicists who would love to come work for us. I suggested he submit this idea using our formal suggestion process. 

Management had a better idea.  They decided that we really didn’t need a sales rep who signed contracts like that without the approval of the technical and legal staff.  As far as I know this customer used our services for free until PCs came along and commercial timesharing went the way of punched cards and paper tape.",166,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF00C790>
47,The User Bubble of Alternate Reality,"Most of my immediate and extended family live within 60 miles of each other except for one family who lives most of the way across the country. Because of this, it's a pretty big deal when they find the time and money to fly in and visit. A few weeks ago, exactly this happened, and there were plenty of family get-togethers as a result. Interestingly, the out-of-town uncle-in-law's family *also* lives near the rest of us, so a few of those events included many of his relatives that I'm not familiar with.

48,"""Hey, I can't type any numbers""","This a short one, but it stills bring a smile to my face when I remember it.

My grandfather is a very successful businessman and I love him to death, but, as is the case with 99% of elderly people, he has absolutely zero clue on how to work around a computer, sure he can write a document, check his emails and browse the internet, but that's about as far as his knowledge goes so I end up taking care of everything computer-related to him.

On one such occasion, I was helping out in his office, y'know, the usual, check the PCs, make sure everything is working fine, nothing major. I also had just installed a printer for him the month prior and it was acting up for some reason (printers amiright?), so in I go, check some cables, check internet, and I get it back up and running in no time, as I was sitting in the secretary's computer typing some random BS just to test if it would print alright I hear the secretary come to me: ""Hey, OP, while you are there on my PC, would you mind also checking my keyboard? I think it broke, I can't type anything on the NumPad, only the numbers up top"". I, being the snarky cunt I am, and already expecting this to be a problem way simpler than she thought it was, just took a quick glance to the side and sniped a key on the keyboard. Yep, you got it, she had just accidentaly turned off the NumLock key, the whole exchange took less than 5 seconds! As I was typing my BS and she came to me to ask about the keyboard, I just looked, sniped the key mid-strokes and just said ""there, it's done"", with my signature snarky grin on my face.

49,How a community college helpdesk got what must surely be one of the weirdest tickets they've ever seen.,"Greetings TFTS, 

This may not be the most exciting of tales, but it does have some twists and turns which I think make it worthwhile. It’s also pretty much the only thing that’s happened to me in this job which I find interesting enough to post here. What you’ll end up reading if you decide to continue was an absolute comedy of errors made mostly by me. It’s slightly embarrassing in hindsight, but I was tickled pink by the situation at the time, regardless. I hope you enjoy it as well.

I also really like writing, and I will be indulging in a tangent or two. Everything is relevant, I promise, but be warned.

TL;DR is at the bottom, because I’m not *completely* psychotic.

A bit of setup to start. This is not going to make sense with the title at first, but we’ll get there.

I am the primary local IT person at my workplace. It’s a private business owned by a major US corporation. I work closely with a team of others, but without getting specific, their focus is mainly on other things. Deploying, maintaining, and troubleshooting user PCs is, for the most part, solely in my domain. 

In the far distant past of mid-to-late 2020, our glorious parent corporation made a bulk computer purchase to replace all of the aging hardware around the company. Ours is one of the larger locations, and we still had a lot of old crap kicking around. The need for most people to have the flexibility to work from home *just in case* it was ever necessary had become apparent, plus we’d finagled certain things so as to get more laptops than we’d *actually* need right away. All told, we ended up being allocated around 150 brand new laptops, plus a limited number of desktop PCs. Due to a combination of manufacturing delays, shipping delays, and poor decision making by our ever-wise, corporate IT overlords, we didn’t actually receive the new laptops until around June-July 2021. By this point the pandemic was in full swing, and much of the near-decrepit hardware that was destined for a dumpster had been sent to people’s homes instead. I had fortunately had the good sense long beforehand to upgrade everyone to SSDs, so with a few exceptions, everything was *mostly* functional. System boards were starting to fail at an accelerating rate, but as soon as the shipment of laptops finally arrived, those people could be issued new systems as needed.

Once the chaos of the sudden work from home transition eventually subsided (busiest two months of my life), and most of the lingering issues settled down (second busiest two months of my life), I had the luxury of taking my time with the new laptop deployments. I could go through one department at a time to bring each user back into the office (only one at any given time due to social distancing) to sign onto the network, sync their profile data, configure their applications, blah blah blah, and leave with a shiny new laptop. I could afford to drag my feet a little on the people (or departments) who were known pains in the ass, using the more tech-savvy, low-maintenance people as the test groups.

The point of all that (plus other factors that I can’t divulge) is that I hadn’t gotten around to unboxing and powering on the last of the new laptops until around February 2022. It was near the end of the line that I came across something odd.

-----
Now, a tangent, but a relevant one.

Some *extremely competent individual* at corporate IT thought it would be a good idea to have an SCCM OS deployment preloaded on every machine. What we were told to do at the outset was to simply plug each computer into the network prior to the initial startup so it could complete the Task Sequence, and then it’d be ready to go! Except that they wouldn’t be even *remotely* ready afterwards. The OS, drivers, and software installed by the preloaded Task Sequence were all horrendously out of date due to the long series of delays (the longest of which actually would have been avoided were it not for this preloaded deployment nonsense, but going into that would require more detail than I’m comfortable sharing). Furthermore, the preloaded deployment would have added each computer to the domain with the *system default* hostname, and in the default, top-level *computers* OU. That meant that for every computer, I’d have to wait for the auto-deployment to finish, then *manually* update the hostname, then *manually* move it to the local OU, then wait for Group Policy to kick in so I’d have local admin rights, then apply the slew of necessary updates, then finally perform whatever individual configurations were needed for that particular machine. Every, single, time.

I realized very early on (before the PCs even arrived, when corporate sent the above instructions) how stupid that was. I tried it anyway for the first batch of computers like a good little boy, and my instincts ended up proving spot on. Manually PXE booting straight out of the box didn’t work because of whatever the preloaded Task Sequence does to the boot sector, or something like that, anyway. I could have booted to installation media and reformatted the disk first, but doing that every time was still more hassle than I’d like. I figured out that if I simply started up the machines while *not* connected to the network, I could just let the preloaded Task Sequence run its course, and it wouldn’t be able to do any of the domain steps. I could then set it aside and wait until I needed to get more laptops ready. At which time, I could PXE boot like normal, running the OS deployment with the most recent updates, the correct hostname, and in the correct OU from the very start, without having to do any additional AD BS. Sure, the OS deployment itself took longer than if I’d followed the instructions, but not by all that much. Besides, who cares about the extra time it takes when that time is completely hands-off? I’d rather have something take three hours mostly hands-off than an hour mostly hands-on any day of the week. That way, I can be *more productive* over time while doing *less work*, but I suspect I’m preaching to the choir in that regard.

-----

My apologies. That was my only *big* tangent, I promise. I think I just needed to finally get that out.

Anyway, configuring one of these new laptops typically went like this. *Don’t* connect it to the network. Then power it on, wait for the preload to finish, power off, connect to the network, PXE boot, run the OS deployment, install department-specific software, done. I had it down to a science, and usually did anywhere between three and a dozen computers at a time.

Near the end of the line, however, something strange happened. Now, the warning signs of what *actually* occurred were as obvious as they were numerous, but, you know, hindsight.

I came across a laptop which *didn’t* launch into the dumbass preloaded OS deployment. Instead it was standard, OOB Windows 10. “Fine by me,” I thought. “Saves me some time.” Then the very next laptop I grabbed did the same thing. It was just those two out of the 150 or so laptops that did this, and they happened to be right next to each other on the pallet. So that’s weird, but no big deal, right? I proceeded to install the OS and get the laptops configured like normal, but then realized there was something wrong with the displays. They looked like *crap.* The color was washed out, the backlight was funky, and the resolution wouldn’t go above 1368x768. Even the BIOS looked awful. “Surely that’s wrong,” I said to myself. “There’s no way you can buy a business class laptop this expensive with a display this bad.” I went through all the typical troubleshooting, and concluded the LCDs were either faulty, or the manufacturer installed the wrong ones. Manufacturer support was awesome and accepted both laptops for repair without any fuss.

The manufacturer sent a box for each laptop to be shipped to their repair center. Strangely, however, one of the boxes was the wrong size. It was for a larger, full size model with keyboard+keypad, which these laptops were not. So that’s weird, but no big deal, right? Whoever put the shipment together must’ve just gotten the boxes mixed up. Stuff like that happens. Added a little extra packing material, and it was perfectly fine.

Something else was strange about those return boxes, which was the shipping labels. I’d sent many laptops in to the manufacturer for service over the years, and had never seen something like this. Normally, the shipping label has my name, followed by the name of our parent company, followed by the building address. These labels, however, had my name, followed by *some other company,* followed by the correct building address. Moreover, each label indicated a different company; they were not the same as each other. So that’s weird, but no big deal, right? They still ended up in the right place, after all. Must have been some kind of bizarre glitch in their system, or else with the shipping company. I’ve seen *much* stranger things from FedEx.

I shipped the broken laptops out for repair and was fully satisfied the problem was solved.

Some time passed, and one of the laptops returned. I booted it up and was surprised to see the display problem remained, despite the repair notes saying the LCD was replaced. I immediately set about writing a scathing response to the support technician, but stopped myself. I thought back on all of the warning signs I’d seen up to that point, each of which I had dismissed for what seemed like perfectly sound reasons. When considered all together, though… 

Ah… fuck.

I knew exactly what the problem was at that moment, but wanted to be sure before I started sending emails and telling my boss. 

First I went digging on the manufacturer’s purchasing site, and confirmed—to my amazement—that you can indeed spend well over $1000 on a business laptop with a worse-than-awful 1368x768 display. If you have to stretch your budget that much, why would you not start with a cheaper brand? Or just buy Chromebooks? But I digress.

I looked up the serial number on the manufacturer support site. Something which I had already seen earlier was that this laptop had a much shorter warranty than usual. This I had attributed to an error by corporate purchasing. It wouldn’t have been the first time I’d seen it happen. Again, I had dismissed this warning sign for what seemed a totally valid reason. This time, I also looked at the listed specs.

More than just the display was wrong. It had half the RAM, a slightly slower CPU, and a standard camera (as opposed to IR). Weirdly, they had the same size of SSD, which I guess was corporate cutting some of the cost in a way that makes sense for once. The laptops are all single-user, and most typical users won’t need more than 256GB to work with. The shared desktops are a different matter, but I digress.

Finally, I did what I should have done at the very beginning. *I turned the laptop over and looked at the bottom.* Where I would normally expect to see a manufacturer-affixed label indicating the company name, serial number, and warranty dates, there was nought but bare laptop. My most recent suspicion was confirmed.

**This is not my laptop.**
---

It was shipped to me, and it was wrapped up on the same pallet as all the others, but this thing ain’t mine. Neither, I expect, is the other one. Speaking of which, where is the other laptop? The two hadn’t come back from the repair center at the same time, and it’s now been two days since the first one returned. So that’s weird, and I was no longer dismissing anything weird. 

-----
So begins another tangent. It’s not really a tangent, though. More of an offshoot. So *technically,* I didn’t lie when I said my first tangent was the only big one. This one is even bigger! *But it’s not a tangent.*

To make this less confusing, I’m going to give the two laptops names for this portion of the story. They will be called *“Leonard,”* and *“Heinrich.”* 

I sifted through my emails and realized that I had only been receiving status updates for Leonard, the laptop which had already returned. Not one word for Heinrich. Heinrich had apparently fallen off the edge of the world the moment it left the mailroom. I looked up Heinrich’s serial number and encountered something *really* weird. The site was trying to redirect me to international support because the number I had looked up was *registered to a company in Germany.* Pushing through, I saw that Heinrich not only had different specs, it was being shown as a different model altogether! That would explain why the manufacturer had sent me the “wrong” box, but how could this kind of mixup have happened?

Fortunately, I tend to be very fastidious with my documentation. I’ll admit there were some lapses of this during the hectic early days of the pandemic. Otherwise, however, I make note every single computer’s serial number, location, primary user, last reimage date, etc. in an Excel workbook. When my massive shipment of laptops arrived, I took all the serial numbers from the individual boxes as I counted them, and added them to a new sheet (in hindsight, I *should have* used the packing slips for this; you'll see why). As I unboxed and imaged each laptop, I’d print what would be its hostname on a tape label, formatted [location]-[serial number], referring to the box label for the serial number. Then as they were imaged, I’d add the hostname from the label I’d printed to the proper location in my workbook with all the relevant info. It’s a simple process that I had been using for years, and had never managed to screw up. Until now.

I compared Heinrich’s serial number with the list of serial numbers I’d made for the initial shipment, and figured out what happened. 

For one laptop out of around 150, I mistyped the serial number when I was printing the label. By pure happenstance, that laptop turned out to be Heinrich. Also by pure happenstance, when I was creating the support case with the manufacturer (regarding what I thought were two faulty LCDs), I did it using Leonard’s serial number, and simply included Heinrich’s in the case notes. When indicating Heinrich’s serial number, I referred to the visible label I had printed, which was wrong. And because I did it through the case notes, the usual process of confirming the serial number didn't happen for Heinrich. Also by pure happenstance, the mistyped serial number *was still a valid one.* It was just for an entirely different laptop, *not Heinrich.* So when the manufacturer created a separate repair case in their system for the serial number I’d indicated, it went through just fine. They sent me the appropriate box for the serial number I’d given them. Instead of receiving the expected serial number, however, the repair center got Heinrich.

This, I assume, is why I didn’t get any status updates whatsoever about Heinrich. Heinrich didn’t actually have an existing support case. Heinrich was just some random laptop as far as the system was concerned. This also explains why the shipping label for Heinrich’s box showed a *different company name* than the label on Leonard’s box. The label that the manufacturer generated wasn’t for Heinrich at all.

When I realized my idiocy, I emailed the manufacturer support technician to see if they could track down Heinrich. I spent about a day mildly freaking out, thinking that I’d lost Heinrich. It may very well have been halfway to a repair center in Europe for all I knew. Alas, my worrying was for nothing.

I like to think that the person who opened the box at the repair center saw Heinrich, and was initially confused about the smaller laptop with the extra packing material around it. They may have then scanned Heinrich’s actual serial number, realized it was one character off what was on the repair ticket, read the label that some idiot had stuck on there, and had a nice laugh at their expense before packing Heinrich back up in another (properly sized) box and shipping it back to whence it came. Oh, and instead of sending it next-day express like they usually would, they slow shipped it just to make up for the waste of their time.

So yeah, that’s the anticlimactic end to this ~~tangent~~ offshoot. Heinrich made it back just fine, only a few days behind Leonard. This whole section is pretty much worthless to the overall story. It would have been cut were this not based on actual events. As it occurred, the mystery of what happened to Heinrich was just an extra bit of trouble I had needlessly made for myself, which needed to be resolved before I could actually address the main problem.

-----

Once both laptops were back in my possession, I confirmed that they were identical to each other in every way. Neither of these laptops were mine, and wherever they should have gone, they very likely ought to have ended up in the same place.

Due in part to my meticulous documentation, I knew that we definitely received the correct *number* of new laptops. I had counted them twice when they arrived, and I was 100% sure of it (a claim I don’t often make, especially of late). If we got two laptops which weren’t really ours, that meant that two of our *actual* laptops were missing. So, where did they go?

It was at this point that I could have simply raised the issue to someone in corporate purchasing and let them figure it out. The manufacturer would have sent two replacements, and everything would have been settled. But do you honestly think I could have possibly resisted seeing this thing through to the end myself? Absolutely not! I *had* to know where our laptops went and where these two misfits were supposed to have gone.

I turned back to one of the glaringly obvious warning signs from earlier, *the shipping labels.* 

As a reminder (because of how long this story has gotten all of a sudden), when the two laptops went out for their unneeded repair, the manufacturer first sent a box for each laptop with preprinted return labels. Those labels displayed the names of *different companies* where our parent company ought to have been. When the laptops returned from the repair center, the new labels had the same discrepancy. For reasons explained in the above section, one of those repair center labels was completely irrelevant. The other label, however, which I had simply dismissed earlier as “huh, that’s weird,” said this:


**[County Regional] Community College**   
----
(hereafter referred to as “CRCC”)

“So, that’s why these laptops are such pieces of crap!” I exclaimed, jubilantly. It all made perfect sense now. This community college must have made a bulk computer order that was being fulfilled at the same time as ours. Whoever put the shipment together must’ve just gotten the boxes mixed up. Stuff like that happens. 

With that, a ray of light appeared before me. Were the community college’s laptops swapped with mine? If they should happen to have gotten my missing laptops, that’d mean I wouldn’t have to get any sales reps or purchasing departments involved whatsoever, potentially saving me several days of back and forth emailing with corporate!

I searched around and found that CRCC was in a different state, but relatively close to mine, which seems to make sense. I found their IT department’s website easily enough, but I wasn’t able to track down any kind of direct contact information. The only email address I turned up was for the CRCC IT helpdesk.

I then turned to my immediate colleagues and asked if anyone wanted to place bets on whether CRCC’s helpdesk would be slower to respond than our own Corporate IT helpdesk. Unsurprisingly, I didn’t have any takers.

I sent the CRCC helpdesk a message to this effect:

>Greetings and be prepared for one of the weirdest emails you’ll see today,
>
>I am the local IT person at [business] in [City, State]. I believe I have two laptops in my possession which actually belong to CRCC.

I figured I would need to instantly hook whatever college student happened to be manning the helpdesk that day, and that such an opener would do the trick. I then proceeded to explain my theory of what had happened. I included the serial numbers in question as well as a picture of the shipping label showing the name of the college.

I then described the laptops they would have received if there had been a true switcheroo, and ended with an impassioned plea to help rectify the situation, just between us lowly IT people.

>I’m hoping against hope that your laptops somehow got swapped with mine, that you’ll be able to track them down, and that we can just correct the problem ourselves. Basically, I’m asking you a favor. This is going to be a giant headache between me, [manufacturer], and our corporate purchasing department. I’m hoping that you’ll be able to save me a few weeks of bureaucratic nonsense.
>
>I am genuinely looking forward to hearing from you. If nothing else, this will be an amusing story.

It was well over six months past the ship date, so even if CRCC did have my laptops, I was doubtful they’d be able to retrieve them if they were already deployed. But I figured it was worth a shot. I was also a little concerned that the proposal to swap my laptops for theirs would read a little scammy, but I trusted that this message would be so unusual that it would get passed along to someone who would know what I was talking about. 

I fired that off at about 4:00 PM on a Tuesday afternoon. Just after 9:00 the following morning, I began my day by having a wonderful conversation with the CRCC helpdesk manager. 

As expected, I made an immediate impression on the frontline tech. It had triggered their scam instincts (understandably so), but they were thrown off by the strangeness of it and passed it along. When it got to the person to whom I was speaking, they saw right away it was probably legit. 

They recounted paying a visit to the college’s head of purchasing and asking if my story rang any bells. To their amazement, the answer they got was an *instantaneous* “yes.” That didn’t surprise me one bit; accounting & finance people tend to have savant-like memories, in my experience. 

The story I was told is that CRCC had indeed made a large computer purchase around the same time as us. When their shipment arrived, however, it was two laptops short. Under normal circumstances they would have rejected the delivery, but they couldn’t afford any more delays due to the pressing need for laptops in the middle of the pandemic. I imagine a college (even a regional community one) were probably a lot busier than I was in this regard. They had little choice but to accept the delivery, which precipitated a pitched, three-month-long battle with the manufacturer to get the remaining laptops they were owed, with the manufacturer insisting all had been delivered, because the system said so.

To my slight disappointment then, CRCC did not have my missing laptops. Still, we had a very enjoyable chat. I got the impression that the college’s purchasing person was genuinely grateful for the closure I provided, and for the fact that their harrowing fight with the manufacturer was now completely vindicated. In return, they dug up the original invoices. They sent screenshots later that day which definitively proved that these two laptop were originally supposed to have been theirs. Those invoices were all the evidence I would need.

The end of the story is rather boring, so I’ll wrap it up quick. 

I had a choice of how to proceed next. I could either, A) contact the guy at corporate in charge of computer purchasing, with whom I’ve dealt multiple times in the past, and is undeniably a dick, or B), try my luck with our parent company’s sales rep with the manufacturer. After a surprisingly prolonged period of deliberation (maybe 30 seconds), I emailed the entire tale to the sales rep, including photos of the serial numbers and the invoices from CRCC. The sales rep agreed to send replacements without question.

At long last, on this very day, the final two of my new laptops have arrived. They're even have the right specs this time.

Leonard and Heinrich were shipped back to the manufacturer last week, and they lived happily ever after. Or not. I couldn’t care less.

""I do,"" replied Bob.

""Well, I need some help. I bought this gorgeous 27"" iMac, and I can't login...."" And the conversation fades and I don't hear any more.

Late that afternoon I'm walking with Dave out to our vehicles to head home. ""Any exciting plans for the evening?"" I ask.

""No. I'm going up to the mall to go the Apple store. I can't log into my iMac.""

""Right. I overhead you talking to Bob about that at lunch. He wasn't able to help? Tell me what your issue is.""

""Well, I have this iMac I bought a couple months ago. When I set it up, I logged in using a code on my Apple watch, and since then I just type a password to log in. But for the past couple of days, I haven't been able to log in. I turn on the computer, and it starts up. But then nothing. I click with my mouse to get the login box, but then it doesn't respond. I can move the mouse cursor, but I can't get it to do anything else.""

""Hey Dave, have you charged your keyboard?""

""What? They keyboard needs charging?""

""Well,"" I said, ""since it's new, I'm assuming it's a wireless keyboard, so it runs on battery power. And for the past couple of years the iMac keyboards and mice don't use alkaline batteries; they have built in re-chargeable ones. There should have been a cable that came with it, and you just need to plug that into the keyboard and a usb port on the computer and you should be good to go. After a few hours you can unplug it again. And for good measures you should probably charge your mouse, too. Give it a go and text me later to let me know if it works.""

My approach to that was to have them bring their laptop bag in to me, so that I could ""get them sorted out."" They would front up, expecting a new Surface. Instead, I'd make them remove everything from their laptop bag, with the exception of the 840 and its charger. Then I'd make them compare it to a Surface Pro, with accessories, in the same type of bag, before telling them to fuck off - there was less than 200g difference, when you included the type cover, mouse and a couple of dongles and all the excessive weight was all the other crap that they were cramming into their laptop bags.",171,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF00CCA0>

Me: No, that could probably kill the motherboard, and the whole laptop as a whole.

Jane: Oh, that's like a .1% chance of happening, OK?

Me: No, more like a 65% chance right now. That's **why** I turned the laptop off.

We cleaned the laptop the best we could, and we turned it on. I had to plug the laptop in, but it did work!

58,I Dressed Down the Commanding General,"I recently returned to the IT world, and this story recently returned to my mind. We are having network issues here at work, so I decided to go ahead and jot this down. I know this is military heavy, but still concerning IT.

This happened about 16 years ago when I was deployed to Eastern Europe with the Army.

I was a member of the G6 (basically military helpdesk). Despite my rank (E4/Specialist), I was one of the go to people for tech problems)

Cast:

$Me – at the time, a lowly Specialist (E4), but part of the head tech team, lost hopelessly in the pursuit of getting my E5 (Sergeant rank)

$SGM – My Sergeant Major (E9) - basically my big Boss on the enlisted side of things.

$CG – Commanding General – THE BOSS of the entire mission. For you civilians out there, he was the equivalent of a CEO.

$CSM – COMMAND Sergeant Major – My $SGM Boss (he would be like a COO)

Now for some military context: We had two networks the NIPRNET (non-classified) and the SIPRNET (classified.), then there was the TOP Secret Network. All of these were regulated by AR 25-2, which laid out VERY SPECIFIC rules for all of these networks. One of which was you DO NOT under ANY circumstances have the NIPRNET and SIPRNET on the same computer. There are even rules for laying out the cabling, saying like you cant have NIPR and SIPR cables within a foot of each other.

Now, as you can probably imagine, the majority of these people were up in age, and really didn’t know the in’s and outs of technology, etc.

$SGM got it though. He told us that he was just a “nerd” and we lower enlisted (Sergeants and below) were the “geeks,” and while he was trying to become a geek, he would trust us with the mission, and anything that we wanted to do, as long we could justify it, he would take it to the brass, and “keep the brass off our asses.”

So one day, $SGM and I were walking and talking about some aspects of the mission. Usual type stuff.

We happen to walk pass the $CG office, and we hear from inside:

$CG: $SGM! OP! Need to talk to you.

So we look at each other and silently said to each other “Now what?”

So we dutifully walk into his office, and lock up (parade rest).

$SGM and me: Yes sir?

$CG: Yeah, I was just wondering if it would be possible to have the NIPRNET and SIPRNET on my computer here. I don’t want to have to go to another room to check the SIPRNET.

My gut just flipped. I just looked at $SGM.

$SGM: *OP, you want to handle this?*

I could only imagine the look on my face towards the SGM. **He had TOTALLY thrown me under the bus/half-track!**

I looked at the $CG, and took a breath.

$Me: Sir, permission to speak freely?

$CG: Of course, go ahead.

I took a deep breath, say a very quick prayer, and look at him dead in the eyes, and said:

**“SIR, ARE YOU OUTSIDE YOUR DAMN MIND?”**

$CG: *(taken aback)* Excuse me, Specialist OP?

$Me: Sir, AR 25-2 clearly states that all NIPR  and SIPR connections must be on different machines, and the SIPR computers go through a COMPLETELY different imaging procedures than the NIPR computers do.

More policies are put in place to prevent removable media, and other registry entries are put in place so that rogue software cannot be installed.

But I tell you what, sir, if you want me to do that, fine. I will do it under protest. While I am at it, I’ll put in a third network card to where you can have the TOP SECRET network on this unit so you won’t have to go to the SCIF *(the Top Secret, Secret Squirrel building)* to get your high level briefs, and you won’t be that far away from your coffee maker.

And when all the alarms go off at the US Army Europe, National Guard Bureau, DOD, don’t come crying to me.

Oh – you want me to run it to the hooch (barracks) too?

$CG: SPECIALIST!

$Me: (gulp) Yes......,sir?

$CG: You’ve made your point. Both of you are dismissed.

About face and walk out.

Get out to the hallway, $SGM grabs my shoulder and spins me around… and glares me down.

$SGM: DAMN IT Specialist OP – you don’t talk to a General that way!’

$Me: I had permission to speak freely……and I was just quoting regulation and pointing out how insane his idea was. I did nothing wrong.

$SGM\*: (just glaring at me….. and eventually turns into a smile.)\* **Good job**. *(punches me on the shoulder)*

I have never sweated so many bullets.

The next day, I get a call from the $CSM, telling me to get to his office immediately. Oooooohhhh boy…..

So I snap to, head over the $CSM office. Knock three times (custom) he says “GET IN HERE NOW!”

Uh-oh…

Me (at parade rest): Yes, $CSM?

$CSM: Specialist OP, what in the HELL did you tell the “Old Man” yesterday? *(I knew the $CG was out of the office, because we enlisted only that term behind his back…I know…wrong)*

Me: $CSM, I just reminded $CG about the regulation regarding network protocols as described in Army Regulation 25-2…..

$CSM: I know the regulation Specialist OP!

Me: Yes, $CSM

He got up from his desk and walked up right in from of me. I am about 5’11. HE is well over 6ft, somewhat intimidating.

$CSM: You know what problem I really have Specialist OP?

Me: No, $CSM….

$CSM: I HAVE BEEN WANTING TO TALK TO HIM LIKE THAT SINCE THE VERY BEGINNING OF THE MISSION….AND YOU GOT BY WITH IT! YOU KNOW HOW BAD THAT MAKES ME LOOK? I SHOULD BUST YOU BACK TO CIVILIAN!

Me: I just did my job $CSM….

$CSM: I know! And your damn good at it!

Me: “…..”

$CSM: (starting to smile, and calm down) ….and that’s why I am so happy you are on this mission with us.

Me: (internally keeping my nerves in check) I’m honored to be here, $CSM….

$CSM slaps me on the shoulder… “At ease OP….you did the right thing. Now…. I do have an email problem……”

Me: (*internally eyerolling, and thinking “Figures….”*)

I helped $CSM out and returned to my desk……

**I was promoted to Sergeant a few weeks later…..**

ETA: I want everyone here who has said that I yelled at the General: **I DID NOT.** I used a stern voice, **yes**, **but I did not yell at him.** I put that text in bold just to emphasize my frustration with such a request considering the security issues that we were already dealing with after the TOA (transfer of authority) that were left to us by the previous unit, and that request almost pushed me over the brink.  While using sarcasm, I kept my composure, and my voice at a respectful level.

Also - I think that overall - my promotion was just a happy coincidence, and I am not saying that event had anything to do with it. I had done my time, I had earned my stripes, and it was just weird that it happened so close to that event. Just a weird coincidence.

Lastly - I appreciate all the up votes and awards. I didn't expect this to blow up like it has. HOOAH to my military brothers and sisters. ",206,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF00C4F0>
59,"Fix the connection, the training has already started!","This just happened to me and thought it would be great here.

A group at work had a meeting set up for some training with an outside vendor.  The vendor is working from home (Lucky them), while the rest are in a training room, in the office.  The people being trained barely know how to log onto the systems...  They had me come on-site (well, my desk is just across the street in another building, and no work-from-home for me!) to help get them all signed into the systems.

The video was a little pixelated and lagging when they started, thought it was just a slow connection, and didn't think anything of it.

Got a call shortly after I left helping everyone get set up, that the presenter was having issues controlling the slide deck (which was on the presenter computer in the training room) and demanded I fix it.

Advised that the building's internet wasn't the issue (100m long, 5 story building with several hundred desks... and only this one presenter having issues... yea, not likely the network at the office), and have the presenter reboot his home router.  

Got an e-mail back after about 15 mins that they are all working.  Don't know why people never think of their home connection with the cheap cable modem/router/wifi combo boxes as being the cause, and think it's the corporate systems with dedicated hardware that is much more reliable.",91,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF00C970>
60,Oatmeal Lady,"I would like to make my contribution to the ""stuff that shouldn't be in your PC"" category of tales.

I used to work in a PC repair shop in a small town (AKA the only PC repair shop within an hour's drive). One rainy day, my coworker was present and we were chatting, working on stuff, and just generally having a pleasant day.

In walks this young woman with her PC in a trash bag (which did not immediately set off alarm bells for me seeing as it was raining). I was closer to the front door, so I greeted her and asked what was wrong. She explained how it was a custom PC built by a friend a while ago. And that she was afraid to turn it on. Now I am a bit worried, and ask her if she accidentally spilled fluid into it or if she saw the infamous magic smoke. She just shook her head, then proceeded to untie the trash bag.

The smell was ***horrible***.

I can hear my coworker gag from the room next to our front office after a moment of silence. I just stare at the young woman who had brought this PC into our tiny, poorly ventilated shop, too stunned to speak. She explains, ""Yeah, I spilled oatmeal in it. A few days ago. So I left it outside in this bag. I was hoping it would harden and I could chip it off."" Now...it was summer time of course. And where I live, it must have hovered around 90-95F that week. This oatmeal was made with milk and must have curdled in those temps, so when she opened this bag, all hell broke loose for your nostrils.

Apparently, the PC sat next to her desk where she ate breakfast. She knocked her fresh bowl of oatmeal directly on top of the PC case. It dripped through the radiator, upper fans, down the motherboard, and onto the graphics card. One big, horrifying, goopy mess. Fortunately, the client immediately unplugged the PC, so it (somehow) was not damaged. Though, cleaning it took my coworker and I hours as we kept having to walk away. Nonetheless, after a whole thing of contact cleaner, a soft bristle toothbrush, patience, and some gagging, it was clean! And turned on!

Though, I noticed corrosion on the inside of some her graphics card's display ports. When I asked the client about it as I could not figure out what happened there, she said her toddler occasionally played with the display cables, putting them in her mouth then plugging them back in (!).

""That wouldn't cause any harm to it, right? I brush her teeth.""

Fortunately, one HDMI port still worked on the graphics card. Though explaining why organic substances - especially those of the liquid variety - were bad for computers to an adult was quite interesting. Even if those organic substances are your toddler's saliva. And yes, even if you keep up on said toddler's dental hygiene.

Not as funny as some of the other tales I've read here, but hopefully someone gets a kick out of my trauma from dealing with the general public!",35,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF00C550>
61,Owner of company needs a talking to.,"I’m pretty new to this Reddit but I feel at home. 
So I’ve been in IT since the mid 90s mainly support and management of support. 
This happened late 90s. I was working for an IT recruiter, one of the biggest at the time. We had just fitted a firewall for the first time, (shows how long ago) that logged all users browsing. 
I was called into my managers office thinking the worst, but was happily told that I needed to have a word with the owner of the company. 
The Reason  I had to have a word was because, a) the senior IT staff couldn’t stop laughing, b) they thought it was funny to send me and c) I had been there only a few months. 
So it was I that had to go and tell someone that was in the Times 100 richest people list, that he had to stop browsing  his “very special interest” sites during the day on his work computer as IT were flagged every time he visited one. He took it on the chin, laughed and asked if I’d got the short straw and let me on my way.",135,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF00C0A0>
62,"Excuse me, I can't help you with that..","So this happened a few minutes ago. I'm a tech support agent at a very large global company. We do all kinds of stuff, my departement mainly handles general first line support for customers.

I get the occasional ""weird"" call. Sometimes customers have a weird problem, and sometimes the customer is the problem. To me, these are the highlights of my days, but I digress.

TL;DR at bottom

Today, I got a call that started normal with a normal issue, but quickly went sideways like so;

Me: ""Alright so your issue has been resolved, is there anything else I could help you with?""

Cust: ""Sure, I still have some questions. My pharmacy stopped prescribing this weight loss drug and my doctor wont prescribe it to me. Can you do this, or make them?""

Me: ..... ""I'm sorry, what? Not sure I follow""

Cust: ""My doctor wont prescribe this medication, can you?""

Me: ..... ""I'm sorry but we're CompanyA, I can't assist you with pharmacy stuff and medication...""

Cust: ""Hmpf. I thought you guys were a big company as CompanyA, no matter...""

Me: ""Anything else from our products or services that I could help you with?""

Cust: ""Actually, yes! I have a huuuuge bank account with money from all over, can you help me make a few transactions and help me with some connections toward this company?""

Me, at this point completely given up: ..... ""Miss, this is CompanyA, please, please contact the right support or people for your issue...""

A few back and forths later, I finally get through to her that I am from CompanyA, not her doctor, not her banking support.

Cust: ""So about that prescription, can you at least get me that?""

Me: .......... ""Thank you for calling, if you have any further questions please give us another ring, have a splendid sunday!""

Customers can really do a number on you.

TL;DR: 
Customer asks me to prescribe medicine and send money from her account to poor country, I cant, obviously, as I am just a tech support agent.",29,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CD20F130>
63,Keeping your head below the parapet! A survival tip from the OLD Retired Tech support Guy.,"This is only my second post on here, but following that I had a few requests for more stories. It seemed from my last post that a lot of you work in fairly high pressure environments. For myself I was On IT Support for a large London trading Bank, moving on later to become the IT manager of said bank answerable only to the IT Director who shall remain nameless. 

During my 9+ years at this Bank, it was a woman IT Director for the around the first 6 years until she was replaced.

Now this lady it must be said was feared by ALL the IT staff, myself included. When she was not happy about something, the whole floor could hear her. Her shouts from behind her closed office door made most people freeze with an ""Uh Oh... who's getting a new one torn now?"" expression.

It must be said that I only experienced her wrath on maybe 4 or 5 occasions during my 6 year acquaintance with her, and she did after all give me the job at the bank in the first place, so I will not speak too badly of her.

This lady was a highly intelligent woman who spoke 3 languages fluently Italian, French and English.

The bank I worked for was not an English bank, though being based in London, everyone spoke English.

The first time I got called to her office was because an important overnight report never got printed because of a glitch in one of the servers.

I stood in her office and stood looking at her in amazement as she looked me in the eye and shouted something like ""What the bloody hell ...French french,,, expect to ..Italian italian... french... Right now! and don't you ... Italian...french...italian.....swahili!???... Report....""

Well, you get the picture. She could not stick to one language when she lost the plot, and anyone of the IT staff she happened to be having a go at could only pray they said the right thing at the end of it....

""So what have you got to say!?"" Pheew I understood that bit! You then hoped your next reply would fit...

 ""Sorry, It won't happen again"" or ""Sorry. I Will look into it right away"" usually sufficed, and you then left and tried to figure out what she was going on about by gleaning information from others.

I quickly found that by adopting an old tactic I had learnt from previous jobs, I avoided being stopped and called into her office.

Basically, get yourself a 'Clipboard' and have some p[apers on it! If you leave your office to go from A to B for ANY reason grab that clipboard. Always walk with purpose, glancing at it occasionally.

Most peoples IT problems are fairly minor. Seeing you purposefully striding past, clipboard in hand. A lot of users will think ""Hmmm maybe I can check the power lead myself?"" etc. Even if it is a pretty serious problem it will give you a few seconds breathing space  because although they may stop you to quickly tell you the problem they won't expect you to fix it there and then because hey, you obviously have bigger fish to fry :-)

I do not see any of this as being a cop out, but it was a coping strategy for me. It allowed me to decide if I wanted to say ""Sure let's take a look."" or, glancing worriedly at my clip board, and saying ""Sorry I am on my way to a meeting."" This later one, more so, when I became IT Manager.

I even used it when called into the Director's Office. I only had to quickly glance at the clipboard while she ranted in tongues for her to say, ""Do you have a problem?"". I could then reply with something along the lines of ""One of the servers is showing an imminent hard drive failure"". ""Well, what the hell are you doing standing there talking to me for, then?! Go and sort it.""

Ok so some of you may look at me in a bad light. But remember, IT support people get a lot of unnecessary crap, and very little thanks. Everyone thinks their issue should be sorted first. If this takes the heat off or gives you a little breathing space rather than have a nervous breakdown, then why not. 

It also helped me remain calm when everyone else was running around like headless chickens. Especially if you have an IT Director running out of her office shouting 'Servers down, Servers Down!""

I used to calmly ask myself what the issue really was. Was a Server down or had a power breaker tripped on a row of traders desks? 
If it was a server, which one? Which floor. Think about causes, effects, solutions, then apply said. 

Getting caught up in other people's madness does not help you or others.

I dare say some at the time would look at me and think, ""He acts like he does not care."" I did care, I just did not panic.

Never underestimate the power of an important looking clipboard...",109,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CD20F4F0>
64,DR room + whole building hot water leak = bad,"So, I worked in local gov in the UK and where I worked had 2 main buildings.

Building 2 had a nuclear bunker under it which also had some other rooms all around it. Oh, and the whole buildings heating / hot water system.

Some of these extra rooms were doing nothing so got chosen as the DR for the I.T stuff that was all in building 1. £100k is roughly the cost to get it done including the fibre links etc.

Anyway, one day I got in to be told the heating system had ruptured and please could we all run down there as it was flooding.

So me and 6 colleagues using nothing but brooms, had to stand in a few centimetres of close to boiling water and sweep said water away from the server room for an hour or two? I think we managed to keep all the kit safe though and they did buy us all new shoes as ours were boiled to death.

Who exactly did the risk assessment, that's what I want to know. 

£100k of kit next to an ageing hot water system? Really?

Fun fact about the nuclear bunker, if a nuke hit the nearest very big city, the idea is that someone starts filling the water reserve with fresh water for the people to have whilst in there. But, we were told with authority, that there was nowhere near enough time for that to be done before the shockwave/fallout hit, so basically, utterly pointless room that they keep stocked with food, just in case!",24,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CD20FC40>
65,"Hello, you've reached tech support how....oh no","I work in a tech support department in a big call center for a phone/internet/tv company. 

I get a call last week, seems fairly normal; Customer is pretty upset because our shitty ass Sales department (don't get me started on them) messed up the order and it got cancelled and customer was supposed to get the modem today. 

He sounds like he is 40+ years old, he starts up with asking for a manager, I try to calm him down and I get to that order and then he starts;

""My wife of 20 years old was cheating on me, she left me and threw away all of my stuff, told me to move out, she took everything away from me! Everything, the kids too! Kids are visiting me today and they need the wifi for homework""

And listen, at this point I did feel bad, I would feel even worse if he aslo wasn't cursing me out and I forgot to mention; He was really really really drunk. 

I have a feeling not having the modem today for the kids is not as bad as being dead drunk on that day....

Anyway, I feel really bad about all of this so I get to sending the modem out again, I go into ordering, I try to resend equipment, During all this my cx seemed to mellow down, got a little quiet, but I heard some scary gurgling noises here and there...(ignoring this)

I finish the order, the gurgling and what seems like snoring get really loud, I tell the customer we're finished and that unfortunately we can't get the modem there today...no response.

I am pretty scared at this point, I don't really want him to respond, drunk people freak me out so much, even on the phone, for reasons I won't disclose, but I have to do my job so I try to ""hello sir, hello, are you there"" him for a couple minutes with intervals of me just being silent and texting my team leader to ask him what to do. 

I finally give up, this man is 100% asleep, I hang up. 

I did finish the order for him, even though I shouldn't do it without his verbal approval but I knew he does need the modem in the end and at least he will get a text message confirming the order.

66,Sausage roll keyboard,"I used to work for local government in the UK and was 3rd line support/network engineer but you know, you get drawn into all sorts of support not just the high end stuff.

I go down there and ask her what gives and I check the keyboard over and lo and behold, there is loads of food leftovers in there and I quietly empty the detritus and mention to her that she should maybe push it out the way at lunch time.

A few months later I see a ticket for the same thing from the same woman.

I go down there, walk in and just pick up her keyboard, turn it upside down and shake the contents onto her desk.

""You could make a whole sausage roll out of that"" I exclaimed loudly, so everyone in her department could hear. I told her if she didn't stop eating over it, no more keyboard for her, and left with her red faced.

It was disgusting, literally pieces of sausage meat under her key caps.

&#x200B;

""laptop won't dock.. I think I broke something""

""Do you need one to access some data?""

""nah.. just brought these movies in from home"" he replies. he reaches under his desk and pulls out a stack of DVDs. They are all retail disks so I figure they should be safe.

""a UBS DVD drive to review training materials?"" he asks as he scribbling.

&#x200B;

""Close enough sir"" I tell him. I watch him start another ticket and I go down to the batcave. Ticket number 2 is in by the time I get there and I pull a USB blueray/DVD drive off the shelf and take it up to Mr. Bunny Slippers to get it set up for him. I also toss in a movie to check it for him. The audio sucks pretty bad on the laptop.

68,*Confusion Noises* - ad Infinium.,"(DMS is Dealer Management Software)

It's been a longstanding theory of mine that perfectly intelligent people regress into a toddler the moment they call the IT line. Here is one such example. (This is more of a rant btw).

Me: *8:00am on a Saturday coverage shift, I work for a large automotive company doing internal support.*

Me: ____ IT Support, this is Dano speaking, how can I help you?

User: I'm at home, and I can't log in to [DMS Portal] at home!

*pretty commonplace, most businesses have a VPN software they use for WFH employees, in our case the [DMS Software] works only through our network. It sounds like her management sent her to work from home without telling us at all as she has no idea what she's doing.*

Me: Okay, did you connect to the VPN, [VPN Name] before trying to sign in to [DMS Software]?

User:  Wait what? Umm Huh *various confusion noises* (This is a trend.)

Me: Sounds like nobody trained you on this or told us you were working from home, your laptop should have it installed already. Can you go down to your Start Menu in the bottom left and search for [VPN Software Name].

User: *confusion noises* (gasp imagine having to use your brain a little when calling IT) Wait where?

Me: *repeats instructions* x2 *confusion noises x2 but she finally gets it. *

User: Okay I got it up now.

Me: Okay click connect and sign in with your Windows username and password (managed through AD security groups), same logins you use to unlock the computer.

User: What's my [VPN software password?]

Me: *facepalm* Windows username, and windows password.

User: *confusion noises but figures it out eventually*

Me: Okay you're signed in now? The VPN is connected?

User: I think, what now?

Me: Open up [DMS Software] and try to sign in.

User: I click it it doesn't do anything.

Me: Double-click? (She would have used this software every day with this company, I onboarded her myself about 6 months ago.)

User: oh, right right, yeah I can log I now.

Me: Awesome have a nice da-

User: But I need [other server for DMS software]

I can't find her device listed, likely a new take away, or our remoting software is not reporting on her system.

Me: Okay having trouble finding you, we'll have to go an alternate route.

User: *confusion noises*

Me: Can you open Chrome and go to [our website]

User: *confusion noises* where is that? (You also use Chrome literally every day, dimwit.)

Me: *repeats, monotone, any cheerfulness gone*

User: *confusion noises* Sorry [partial website address] and then what?

Me: *repeats monotone*

Me: Once you're there, you won't need to sign in, there should be a link to TeamViewer below the password field, otherwise it's in the upper right.

User: *confusion noises*

Me: Is it asking you to sign in, yes or no?

User: Yes, what's my password?

Me: (Slamming face against wall.) Click the Teamviewer link below the password field.

User: *confusion noises x2* (Eventually gets it.)

Me: Okay once it's done downloading it, double click it.

User: *confusion noises* Where?

Me: Bottom of the screen, downloads.

User: I clicked it, nothing happened.

Me: DOU-BLE click it. (This is also something she would do every single day, multiple times a day.)

Me: Double click it to run it, say yes to everything (EULA and legal bullshit), and let me know the ID when it comes up.

Her: *confusion noises* Do I accept the EULA?

Me: Say yes to everything.

Her: I don't have an ID just dashes.

Me: Wait a moment it'll come up, I don't need the password as well.

Her: Oh there is is (rattles off number faster than I've heard he talk all call)

Me: Sorry, i missed that, repeat please.

Her: *confusion noises* It didn't work?

Me: re-peat the num-ber please.

Her: (Finally saying it at a decent pace, at this point we're over 15 minutes into the call.)

Me: Enters it (her rattle off her password I told her I don't need in the background because why actually listen to anything I say), okay say yes to any more prompts, you'll see it restart and give another ID, don't worry about that just give it a few seconds, should connect me anyways, just looks like it's not doing anything. (I hate you QuickSupport)

Her: okay my new ID is-

Me: Wait, a moment.

*VPN fails, because of course it does, either way I'm done*

Me: Okay, this isn't working, I have a workaround.

Me: Can you access your email still? I'm going to send you something.

Her: *confusion noises*

Her: Oh yeah I can get my email.

Me: Go to your email please.

Her: What's my email password?

Me: (Oh for fuck sakes lady, can you even tie your own shoes in the morning, oh my fucking god.) *stays silent*

Her: Oh I figured it out, I'm in.

Me: Okay I'm going to send you a Drive link, you can download the shortcut and put it on your desktop yourself.

Her: *predictable confusion noises*

Me: Just a sec gotta grab the link... *working working*

Her: I didn't get an email.

Me: Haven't sent it yet, just wait a moment please. *typing up email with step by step instructions*

Me: Okay, jsut sent it now, should hit you soon, give it a minute.

Her: (0.5 seconds after this sentence) I don't have it yet.

Me: Give it a minute.

Her: oh got it.""

Me: Okay follow the instructions in the email. *repeats instructions*

(10 more minutes of faffing about as she repeatably forgets how double click and copy/past works, eventually after fucking around she figures it out.)

Her: I clicked on the link nothing happens.

Me: *very exasperated, audibly sighing now* DOU-BLE CLICK

Her: (software comes up) What's my [DMS] password.

Me: Same one as the other server, have a nice day *click*.",67,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CD20F9D0>
69,"""my internet is not working! Video has no sound!""","So I work in a tech support for an internet/tv/phone provider. A couple days ago I get the seemingly typical call, older lady starts with ""my internet is not working blah blah"". I think, ok, lets check. I look at the settings on the modem, I see three devices connected, I tell her that I see that wifi is in fact working but with the benefit of the doubt I ask ""What device are you using? Can you check if it's says ""connected no wifi?""

Lady is confused, she does not know what I'm talking about, after 10 minutes of talking it turns out the sound on her laptop or on the youtube video she is watching is off... But I am a kind hearted kinda gal and decided that even though it's not my problem I will help, it's going to be easy! \~that's where I f'd up\~ 

I'm not going to describe the conversation but it was basically me, telling her to find the speaker icon on the bottom of the screen (she has the yt video on fullscreen), her whispering the word ""speaker"" for 5 minutes, me asking if she found it and her now again being utterly confused at the instruction I gave.

This goes on for about 20 minutes in total, so I finally tell her to close the yt video and look for a speaker icon on the bar on the bottom on the screen....another 20 minutes pass and nothing, she says she doesn't have that.

So I instruct her to go to the Control Panel, the process is the same, she whispers ""control panel"" for 5 minutes, I keep giving her different instructions, changing ways we can get to the volume settings then she goes into the whispering again, not talking much, not asking me any questions just whispering. 

In the meantime her husband yells ""Ya off the phone already?"" periodically. It now turned into 1hr long call and we are nowhere close finding volume settings. I am patient but I am getting more and more worried that we will never find it, I tried every trick in the book to make it easier for her to find the volume setting.

I'm sweating, the old lady is not giving up, it's been 1 hour and 40 minutes, we didn't reach the volume setting and, I don't believe it, after spending all this time on this woman, the call drops.. Can't reach cx back...

I never felt so relieved and so defeated at the same time. I hope she found a way to turn the volume on...",74,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CD20F1F0>
70,X Marks the Spot,"This is my first post on this sub!

...is what I *would* say, if my brain hadn't dredged up the memory of my time as a sound tech for my local church...***6 years ago...***

I was inspired to write up this tale after binge reading all posts by u/Gambatte in about two weeks, seeing myself in these stories of woe and sorrow. No, not in the shoes of the protagonist. Lord knows my experience is not even worthy to be called a peon. This story follows the daring heroics of the lowly Level 1 technician. Did I say daring heroics? I meant belly flopping decision making. Its kinda long, so you've been warned!

I work for a school district of decent size as a freshly minted level 1 technician. When I say freshly minted, I mean my experience in this position is fairly new at less than five months, as I just graduated with my degree this previous May. While I'm new to the position of having a ""big boy"" job, I've worked freelance tech support for around a decade now. I've just not really had a *real world* experience with it yet. The majority of the job is what you would expect from a tech, (what with the managing and repairing of hardware, changing passwords, troubleshooting tickets, etc.) but the major difference is 90% of my day is spent either fixing Chromebooks for children who have used it as a seat cushion/dinner plate and blowing out projectors.

One day, I'm greeted in a daze by a ticket in my queue about a new classroom setup happening. One of the schools I oversee is old (old enough that I used to go there...when I was in the 4th grade...) and as such, not all of the planned placements for rooms have remained the way as originally intended. In this case, the room that was previously used for in-school suspension was being converted into a new classroom for kinder/1st grade (I honestly cannot recall which) and needed a standard setup which consisted of a Chromebox, monitor, VoIP phone, projector, and keyboard + mouse combo. Easy.

Or...

The first problem I came across was in the form of the Chromebox not powering on. Swapped the power cord for another and it worked just fine. No big deal. Once it was on, it was as simple as Powerwashing the system so that it grabs the configuration from our network, clears all past user data, and updates the device. Thankfully, the phone was already in place so I didn't have to touch it, but I made sure all was well there too. All that left was the projector. Which, after a quick glance at the ceiling, revealed that there was no mount in place. Only a sea of ceiling tiles.

Crap.

&#x200B;

Seeing as I couldn't mount it, I notified the principal who requested this change and then reached out to one of my fellow techs for help. They informed me that, if power is present in the room, it should be as simple as grabbing one of the mounts we have at admin. Oh joy, an easy fix! Except, its never an easy fix, is it? I grabbed my ladder and climbed up to see into the ceiling, removing a tile to reveal...a *lot* of insulation rolls that had been unused and just stored there for...some reason...followed by a whole lot of nothing save for the wires for the fire alarm and the embedded lights. Joy. This ticket just became a maintenance ticket didn't it...

I notated the ticket and informed the principal who was less than enthused to hear that this issue would require another contact through maintenance, as she now had to put in a separate ticket through a different system. Not only that, maintenance is known for working on the Soon^(tm) time frame and she *really* didn't want this to take months. Reluctantly she slumped off to send in that maintenance ticket and I carried on with my duties of cleaning out milk spills and replacing Chromebooks that have had their hinges broken off. Again.

A few weeks later, I'm doing my rounds and the teacher (T) of the classroom pulls me to the side saying they spoke to maintenance about the power for the projector and had information for me. That's strange. The principal never informed me of this, nor anyone else. Did they really just talk to the teacher and not inform *anyone* else of this? Here's my first mistake: Assuming.

T: Hey! Maintenance came by and told me they can put the power in!  
Me: Oh that's great! But...why did they tell you and not just do it?  
T: They said that there needs to be an X marked on the tile where the projector is going before they can work on it.

Huh? Why would they require a mark on a tile for them to do this when they're on site, in the room, talking to the teacher who is going to be using it? Couldn't she just tell them where she wanted it?

Me: Couldn't you just tell them where it needs to go?  
T: No, they were very clear that they needed an X  
Brain: That seems very lazyMe: Okay...did they ask you to mark the tile?  
T: No, they were *also* very clear that the tech had to do it. I asked if I should tell you about this and they said ""Oh no, we'll go tell him""

*Wha*

I have never spoken with any of the maintenance team, either from this job or any other. To me they were the boogeymen that existed to haunt my young tech nightmares in fear of cables being rotted out or power just once plug away from sparking a fire. I'm not always on campus as I have multiple campuses to manage, but still I've *never* seen them nor have I received any messages from them about really anything. Which means they probably didn't reach out to me at all *or* the principal who put in the ticket. Needless to say, given the past reputation of maintenance I was rather peeved. So I decided to give them what they wanted as instructed.

Me: Well...alright then. I'll be right back

I then proceeded to make my way to the art room, grabbed a permanent marker, returned to the classroom in question, stood up on a desk, and drew a big X right across the tile the teacher wanted the projector at. All was right in the world and maintenance would return to put power at that panel and then I could hook up the mount. Right?

Fast forward a few *more* weeks, I have a chat message from my supervisor (SU)

SU: Maintenance isn't very happy with you right now. You've ruined a tile by marking on it. From now on please make sure to mark the tile with a piece of paper taped to it. I'll write up some documentation for our meeting so this procedure is better known for the team

**Excuse me, what?**

Me: I was given no other instructions other than to mark the tile with an X. Maintenance said they would contact me about this but have never done so. I've never even seen them here on campus and there's been no attempt to get in touch with me. I'll remember to use paper next time so this doesn't happen again.

SU doesn't respond and I continue with my work, rather simmering at the situation. They've given me no instructions, no context, or any mention of marking with paper. How do they expect me to do what they want from me when they don't specify and *don't contact me as they said they would!* Part of me felt I didn't fully explain the situation good enough, so to give myself closure I decided to call SU directly and talk it over.

Me: Hey SU, just wanted to check up on this to make sure all was good. Things weren't really clear through communication with the maintenance team as they said they'd contact me, but I never really heard from them this whole time.SU: Uh...yeah...

Something about the way he said that was...defeated.

SU: It sounds like there was a communication issue here. Its my mistake for not being more clear, so don't worry about it. Like I said, i'm working on the document so everyone else is clear about procedure.

That's...weird. Why is he taking the blame for this? Its not like he was invo-

Oh god, *he* was the tech that they were talking about. They must have mistakenly thought he was a tech even though he's the direct supervisor for all the techs. He was in contact with them through the whole situation and I wasn't even included in the circle. No wonder this all seemed like I was being cut out. I wasn't even part of the equation!

The moral of this story is to always ask questions when you're unsure of procedure for something. Check on things before you act. Otherwise maintenance yells! As a follow up to this, during one of our meetings the document in question was brought up and the scenario vaguely was explained. Afterwards, I was speaking with one of the other techs before heading to campus and they asked the golden question:

TECH: So...who marked on a ceiling tile? Was it {Other Tech}?  
Me: Nope. That was me. Maint said mark the tile, I marked the tile. Turns out there was more instructions for that and I didn't get the memo! They were mad at me for ruining a tile.  
TECH: Are you kidding me?? They've got a million of those things in storage! One tile being marked on isn't going to hurt anything!  
Me: I kind of figured that a district this big with as massive of funding as it has isn't going to hemorrhage from the loss of that poor tile. But I know now what I need to do so all's well I guess.",12,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CD20FB80>

72,Ash trays on the disk drives?,"This is an early '80's Mainframe story.

Back then I worked worldwide software support for the DBMS suppplied by the UK Mainframe manufacturer ICL that ran on their 1900 range of machines and used to have to go out onto site a lot.

  
Back then in the dark ages Computer Rooms were environmentally controlled sactums. with sticky mats to try and minmise walking-in dust, filtered air that was temperature & humidity controlled. You get the picture.  
Part of the reason for this was the type of disk drives that were still in use. Disk drives back in those days were something else. Contraptions the size of washing machines that had a capacity of 30-80 MB (not a mistype) held on exchangeable disk packs that were themselves 12"" diameter multi-plattered monstrosities that weighed about 10lbs. Changing a disk pack was quite the operation: Offline the disk on the operator console. Hit th estop button on the drive. Wait for the disk to spin down. Hit the open button. Extract the disk using the carrier/cover. Screw in the replacement disk. Close the lid and hit the start button.  
Once the disk had spun up to speed the read/write heads would fire out and ""fly"" above the platters at a distance of a few 1/1000th of an inch.

If any foreign matter got in there, well, things could go south fast. When you have 10 lbs of metal spinning at a couple of hundred RPM, well, stop thinking ""Memory stick"" and start thinking ""Indistrial lathe"".

What has all of this got to do with smoking?  
As I said earlier, most Computer Rooms were almost controlled to clean room standards.

Not in France. Oh no. Not in France.  
In France on one site I visited they had installed ash trays on the sides of the disk drives so ""At least that way I have got the operators to agree to remove their cigarettes fromt their mouths while they are swapping disks""

Sometimes I wonder if it was a fever dream...",128,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CD20F670>

Animals, large or small, like warm things. Laps, fireplace hearths, cows (don't ask) .... the list is long.

But when you have a vertical tower with a top mounted power supply and a top intake fan? Well let's just say things can get pretty heated.

The Setting - A crisp, cold, sunny day. About 30°F/-1°C if I recall correctly which is unusually cold for that time of year in our neck of the woods.

The Players - Me, Customer (C), Customer Husband (CH), other techs (OT), Front End staff (FE).

OT1 brings a PC w/ ticket back from the intake desk and drops it on the bench.

>Me: ""K.""  
>  
>\* several hours pass \*  
>  
>OT1: ""Well that system from this morning is running okay so I'm going to boot into the stress test.""

Our stress test app booted up into a linux image which allocated most of the RAM as a virtual disk and then spawned multiple threads to read/write to the vdisc, real disc, stress the CPU with a math suite, and also decode some video at the same time. It was pretty effective.

Next morning the system is hung. No not like that, get your mind out of the gutter. And the shop smells a little....funky.

We spend about an hour trying to locate the source of the smell without a lot of success. Partly I suspect because our HVAC was a recirculating type so it tended to homogenize the air through the building. It was fading though so we figured it was probably something from outside overnight.

OT1 was off so OT2 took over. The system was powered up but just totally frozen. OT2 started testing individual components in test systems. HDD appeared good, video card appeared good, etc.

Eventually he hooked up the power supply to our load tester and he and I went to lunch across town.

\*cellphone ringing\*

**""You guys need to get back quick. Something's on fire in the shop!""**

Well that's not good....

We arrive to find a fire crew, fire chief, and all the store staff standing around outside. No hoses going into the building or anything so that's one positive I guess.

>Me: ""What happened?""  
>  
>FE1: ""About 10 minutes after you left smoke started pouring out of the shop! It reeked!""

>OT2: ""Well what was it?""  
>  
>Fire Chief: ""Some gadget on one of the benches back there was pouring smoke out like a fog machine.""

OT2 and I looked at each other. Gadget on one of the benches ??

We walk in and see smoke curling off the aforementioned power supply. And oh my gosh it was nauseating. Burnt hair. Not the burnt electronics smell we expected. Clearly burnt hair.

What the frack?

We pull the shop video up and about 5 minutes after we left OT3 went to the front. While they were there, the power supply started spewing a greasy grayish smoke. A few sputters of flame did make attempts to burn us to the ground but fortunately they self-extinguished.

We looked at each other and promptly said 'NOT IT!'.

>Me: ""Hey OT3, we need you to take this power supply apart!""  
>  
>OT2: ""Have fun!""  
>  
>OT3: ""!\*$%\*@(# you guys""

Inside the power supply were the remains of massive amounts of fur. To the point that while the fan would spin there literally was no path for the air to flow through.

>Me: ""OT1 said he blew this out!""  
>  
>OT2: ""Well he's full of s\*\*\*""

77,Let's just adjust the temperature ...,"Back at the start of my IT career, I was a student systems operator on a (at the time) 15+ year old HP 3000 Series III at a college. As background, that system was a REALLY old 16 bit (you read that right) mini-computer that had a boot sequence that involved a set of 16 toggle switches and a step button, three or four 30MB hard disk packs that were about the size of a dishwashing machine and was proudly on display in a glass encased room that was carefully climate controlled (cold).  

One evening I was printing reports and doing some other work when I noticed that the temperature seemed a little warmer than normal. There was a circular recorder in the room (I'll provide a link to an example in the comments) that kept track of temperature and humidity for a week at a time. I took a look at it and saw that we were definitely trending warmer than normal. I wasn't the system manager or main operator, but knew enough to know that wasn't desirable. 

I called the main system operator and was talking to him about what was happening and how to call out the HVAC guys after hours. While I was on the phone, in walked one of the campus security guards.

Guard: ""Hey, it seems warmer than normal in here""

Me: ""Yep. I'm on the phone to see about getting someone out to look at the A/C since we're getting too hot in here.""

On the wall was a thermostat that was locked up in a plexiglass box with slits in it for air flow. 

Guard: ""Huh, I think I have a key for the thermostat box.""

Me: ""Hey, I'm about to call out support, let's just let them work on it okay?""

Guard: ""Well, I'm already here and have the key, so ...""

Sure enough, he had a key that opened the box. He then reached up to the controls.

Me: ""Hang on a sec, don't touch ...""

It was too late. He adjusted the temperature. What he (and I) didn't know is that wasn't a normal thermostat. It had an upper and lower range on it. When he adjusted it, it made the too warm air move into a range (on the thermostat) that was too hot for the system. It stopped immediately - hard power down. 

I'm still on the phone with the main operator and I let him know what had happened. I can't repeat the conversation here, but suffice it to say that there were multiple four letter words involved. 

There was a small crowd lined up outside the glass wall looking in to see what was happening by the time the A/C guy showed up. After he addressed whatever the A/C issue was (I really don't remember now, sorry), I got to start up the system, which still ranks as the strangest boot process I've ever experienced. The toggle switches were numbered 0 - 15. I remember that there were several sets of ""on, off, off, off, on, on, on, off, on, off, off, off, on, on, on, off, step"". After the third or forth step, one of the disk packs spun up and the system booted thankfully (I now understand that I acted a human bootstrap which is included in your PC BIOS today).

I don't think the security guard lost his job, but I know that he got in some really hot water. The rest of the time I worked there, I never saw anyone unlock the plexiglass case around the thermostat.",72,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CD20FA90>
78,They're more expensive because they're better at containing the magic smoke.,"Many years ago I worked for an MSP that primarily served small businesses and nonprofits. Accordingly, many of our clients were *very* cost-conscious. Not in the typical ""IT is a cost center!"" way, but more in that they were working with very tight budgets.

I had a client ask for a quote for some spare Dell laptop power adapters, pretty standard. Identified the correct adapter for their laptop models from the official Dell web store, and had my procurement team create and send a quote to the client.

I get an email back from the client:
> Can you explain why the power adapters you quoted are nearly twice the price as the one I found here? (insert link to Newegg)

I take a look at the Newegg link and respond:
> Well, the product you identified only has a one star rating, and one of the reviews says that the adapter overheated and started a fire. I would not recommend using this product, but if you are willing to take the risk and want to order it yourself, that's up to you.

Response back from the client:
> I have approved the quote. Please let me know when the order ships. Thank you.",46,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CD20F940>
79,"My HP doesn't work, I want a Lenovo.","Bloatware is bad kiddos. 
Couple of years ago I was still working at an MSP supporting multiple different companies. Our biggest client at the time was a pharmaceutical analysis company. Part of some users hobs was to go to various hospitals or pharmaceutical sites and monitor trials and tests.

IT = me
U = user (PhD, massive chip on his shoulder)
ITM = Client IT manager (sweet old lady, lovely to deal with, can get very cross)

Ticket: HI team, I would like to replace my machine (Laptop) as it is not working on all sites, please see the link below for the machine we know works on all sites.

IT: WTH, 16 Gb octo core Lenovo machine?! This guy wants this for private use to load games or something. And why is there no tickets for machine failure for us to trouble shoot.

Call user...

IT : HI (blank), I see you are having some trouble with your machine? What seems to be the problem?

U: it doesn't work on some sites, but on those sites they all use Lenovo machines and they have no problems. I want a new machine and I have approval from my region manager to request the same machines for every one in the field.

(2 - 10 field agents for every country in the eu. This also doesn't include africa or the us)

IT: ok well first, that will need to go the head office for approval, secondly we need to look at the trouble machine to see what's wrong as we might be able to fix it.

U: No, I don't want to waste time on that, I will contact HQ and get the approval... click

IT:Crap, ITM is gonna have a field day with this rubbish.

Spoke to ITM and they agreed that the request is ridiculous, trouble shoot the issue and they can get a standard replacement if needed.

U: I've been told that you must look at my machine. I'm on site and it's not working.

IT: so what is it doing? Not connecting, application freeze, BSOD?

U: BSOD on login.

IT: And this only happens on certain sites.

U: yes, but not always the same site. It works from home and it works on-site if I use my mobile Hotspot.

IT: ok, sounds like a network issue, (never seen its like,  ask senior techs and they also never heard of this intermittent issue before). Can you restart the machine and I will connect before you login. 

U: sigh, fine

Restarts machine, I load up the remote software and connect.

IT: ok login for me.

U: Its just going to crash...*Logs in*

Immediate loss of connection when he hits enter.

IT: ok I assume it crashed. Can you connect via your phone so I can have a look.

U: that's going to cost me alot for data.

IT: its a company issued phone, I will notify accounts and the company will cover it.

Connect to the machine and find the error, do some googling and it turns out it's a driver failure. Reload new drivers and test again.

U: its logging in now.

IT: ok, so let's see what happens.

5 minutes it runs fine. Connects to the FTP drive, crashes. Check logs again, same error. No new drivers
User goes on leave for a couple of days so I spent some time doing research on this issue but find squat. User comes back from holiday.

IT: ok, so we need this machine to come in so we can do more testing on it. We going to issue you with a new machine for now.

U: so I'm getting my Lenovo.

IT: no you are just getting a newer model of the same machine

U: un acceptable, I will call head office.

ITM, shot down his request before it even landed as I was on the phone with her for something else.

New machine gets to site....BSOD....

So now I'm completely confused, how can one make of machine work everywhere but in one location. Google all the error messages, driver issues and wierd bsod messages and find nothing again.

I go to the HP website to read all the documentation on thier network cards when a message pops up. HP velocity app is being pulled indefinitely as it causes conflicts with certain network equipment. No mention of this was found on any forums or help articles before.

IT: ok let's see what happens if we remove velocity from the machines.

Perfect. Working. Order.

User still tried to angle for a new machine cause ""HP machines are obviously faulty if thier own apps cause problems"" but ITM shut that down even harder once we rolled out a script to remove velocity for all machines.

TLDR: HP networking bloatware caused machine to bsod and user tried to leverage a beast of a machine from us.",45,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEF919D0>
80,"""Youre IT fix a sparking fuse box!""","Just had a call from one of our oldest clients, around 11 machines and 1 server all running on site.

He was panicking on the phone,

Him: ""We have just had a power cut, so everything is offline, and the box is sparking.""

Me: ""Can you explain further, what box are you talking about?""

Him: ""The electrical box you installed! And its sparking, is there anything you can do""

(This was installed by someone who worked for this company before I came on board)

Me: ""I can recommend you call the fire brigade and your electricity supplier, there is nothing I can do""

Him: ""But your IT, its computers, you can fix it!""

Me: ""If its sparking it is a fire risk I need you to phone the fire brigade now. It is not IT""

&#x200B;

He hangs up angrily, and shortly after I get a call from my boss, who is elsewhere today, saying ""Just had a complaint that you wouldnt fix a sparking fuse box. Is this correct?""

I explained the above call and he goes ""Good. Its not our problem if its caught fire, and theyre 300 miles away, the fire brigade will get there quicker than we can.""

I dont know what actually happened in the end, but I can now see all their machines and the server is back online so... Job done... Back to checking if machines are fully patched.",236,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEF912B0>
81,Bullet Dodged,"It was 8:30PM EST on a much busier than average Thursday, which had been part of a much busier week. My shift was done in a half hour, and my brain had been done since roughly Wednesday afternoon.  At least the West Coast people had gone home for the day so the odds of anything requiring immediate attention were low.

*Outlook notification dings notifying me of a new incident

I mutter and check to see what the hubbub was, hoping it was something that could wait until the next morning.

""Trying to sign on at home, and my wi-fi hasn't been working all day here or at the office.  Help! I can't be in the office tomorrow and need to be on a 9am meeting!""

Oh joy....

Seeing the user is available on Teams, I call them up in case they're the type that hangs up on unknown numbers.  I could take that chance, leave a voicemail and say 'I tried to call them, but they didn't pick up!', and pray I don't get called before 9pm. However, the place I'm working at now at has re-energized my work ethic so I wasn't taking the easy way out.

The user picked up and was grateful somebody was still on.  I go through all the standard troubleshooting and eventually end up at 'uninstall wireless drivers and hope for their sake the NIC card isn't borked'.

I ask the user to hardwire if they can.....and of course their model of laptop doesn't have an ethernet port and the user doesn't have an adaptor.  Even if they did have the adaptor, finding the proper cord to connect would have been a near herculean effort by how it sounded their technology was setup at home. 

And speaking of herculean efforts, I  came to the realization I would have had to walk her through logging on as a local administrator, going into device manager, hunting down the right devices, and uninstalling them.  Directing a user w/no remote access to their PC through device manager is fun enough, but walking a stressed out user through typing in a windows admin password over the phone?  More fun than a barrel of monkeys.  Rabid, hungry, fire-breathing monkeys. 

I pray you never have to do it, and if you have in the past - you have my sympathies.

As I went through the steps of getting my admin credentials reset so I could get the pc's admin credentials (and messaging my wife that I'll be late getting home) I hear the most magical words come from the user

""Wait, I think it's working!""

Slightly dumfounded I pull up our remote access software, see that the laptop is available to connect, and I successfully connect to it. The user asks what happened, and how it started working and I honestly told them I hadn't the foggiest.  The user and I both agreed its for the best that if its working, then to leave it alone.  I note in the incident clearly that the issue resolved itself w/o any help desk action taken, close the incident, and whisper a prayer of thanks to whomever/whatever was watching over me at that time.

9:00pm hit, and I don't think I've ever shut a laptop down so quickly in my life.  The next day I checked the ticket system and nothing from that user so I guess things were still working good.

TL;DR - The classic 'issue resolves itself on its own even though it makes no sense that it did' saved me a HUGE headache",29,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEF91040>
82,"""You aren't IT, but can you install this program?"" leads to an unexpected twist...","Apologies if details are missing, it's been a long time so some of this has been lost to Father Time...

So this was probably in the mid 00s. I was fresh out of school where I got my Degree in Computering. The job was basic data entry. Anything a monkey would be able to do. Take this piece of paper with data on it, put it into the computer and click save. Repeat dozens of times per day. 

The company was a contracting company that was hired by some government agency. One that's so OCD about it's ""property"" you can't even throw trash in the trash can without approval. Even if that property is a roll of packing tape with no tape left on it. I also needed to get federal security clearance to be employed there, to show I wasn't a terrorist or a threat to national security, and they even checked my credit score too...for some reason, even though I had no authority over money at the job.

There were only about 5 people at the local office, and they all knew I know how to do computer stuff, so come to me for help. One day my boss asked me to install a program on the PCs. I don't remember what the program was, but when he told me what it was, it seemed like a reasonable request to install it. I had to go to each PC and install it myself. We only had 5 PCs so no big deal. I didn't think it would allow me to install it as I already knew I didn't have rights to install software on the PC. I try anyway, and as expected, I get denied.

I ask my boss if he can give me the password to the local admin account. He doesn't know it, so reaches out to the actual IT department. Request denied. 

So I go poking around to see if there's any loopholes I can use to get access. 

Manually copy the files to the relevant locations on the C: drive and manually add the relevant registry keys? I check the NTFS permissions of the C: drive and they *would* allow me to take ownership of the entire C: drive and grant myself (or the Everyone group) full control, if needed. I do have access to regedit as well, and again, the permissions on the keys *would* allow me to take ownership and grant full control. But this method would be way too tedious so I file it in my mind as a ""last resort"".

As I had nothing else to do that day (it was a slow day), I was also tinkering around with other aspects of the PC seeing what I could find. Did they still have Solitaire installed? Turns out they did, along with all the other games that came with Windows. Freecell, Minesweeper, Spider Solitaire, I think they had that pinball game too? 

But after finishing poking around Windows Explorer, I move on to the command prompt. They didn't disable it. So I poke around a bit and get to gpresult. 

    Policy name: SetLocalAdminPassword
    File to use: \\networkshare\files\password.vbs

Please tell me they at least have some access control in place...

    Everyone/Full Control

So the only thing stopping anyone from logging in as a local admin account was knowledge of that network share path and knowing how to open VBS files in Notepad. And nothing at all stopping me from editing the file and changing the local admin password for who knows how many PCs. I facepalm as hard as I could that they would be so stupid.

I try to install the software my boss asked me to and the password works. 

I go back to that network share and poke around the folder structure. There's another folder called ""Archive"", and in there is an archive of all the prior passwords too. They had enough smarts to change the passwords frequently, yet put the password in plain text in a publicly accessible network share that anyone can access. 

And the passwords weren't even that complex either. Probably just as complex as having ""Password123"" as the password. 

As if that wasn't bad enough...

A year or two later, apparently some people were caught browsing the internet while on the job, and they wanted to put a stop to that. We only had 5 PCs so IT decided they would just remote into the PC and uninstall Internet Explorer. I'm sitting there in front of my PC watching their remote desktop session, and all they do is go to Control Panel, Add/Remove Windows Features, and uncheck Internet Explorer. It even says right there on the description that it will only remove the Start Menu and Desktop icons but I guess reading is hard. Yeah, they thought it would *completely* uninstall a core part of the OS. So needless to say it didn't change a thing since we still had basically full control over the PCs short of installing software, plus they still haven't fixed the issue with the admin passwords so we could just log right back in as admin and undo any changes they wanted to make.

The issue with the passwords was eventually fixed years later, right as I was getting laid off from that job because the government agency decided not to renew the contracting company's services. Really makes me wonder if there was any truly sensitive (or possibly even classified) data publicly available with zero access control in place, short of simply keeping the file path a secret...",103,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEF911F0>
83,Please read the version number correctly,"LTL, FTP, etc. - I work part-time as a software developer, so not actual tech support, but I still have a funny story that happened a couple days ago.

Cast:

$me - Hi

$cc - Customer Care guy, they interface with the clients and proxy their requests to the dev team, so they *should* have a grasp of how both sides work. Spoiler: they don't, so we periodically have to support them

$dev - Full-time senior dev

Bit of background: we have various environments for our applications, to which we gradually push new versions. We usually mess around in DEV, then push to TEST, and when QA approves everything gets deployed to production; therefore usually PROD is a couple versions behind compared to TEST, which in turn is one or two bugs behind DEV. While this probably sounds extremely logic (and hopefully familiar) to many of you, TIL that it's not necessarily so obvious. Here we go.

I was happily coding when I receive a very peculiar email:

From: $cc

To: $me, $dev

Subject: <App name>

Hi guys, for some reason it seems that <App name> has a more recent version in PROD than in TEST.

Is it possible to have the same version everywhere.

&#x200B;

(yes - there was no question mark at the end. I know.)

As I finish reading the email a very confused $dev comes over to my desk, scratching his head; we quickly agree that it sounds extremely weird and unusual. I open our deployment platform to check what's going on and the mystery is quickly solved, for this is what I see:

<App name> - TEST - ver x.x.x-beta3

<App name> - PROD - ver x.x.x-alpha12

(note: for those not familiar with how versions work, alpha comes before beta, which comes before the official release)

$dev: \* sigh \* can you handle it?  
$me: I can't just reply linking the Wikipedia page for software versioning, can I?  
$dev: u wish

I took a screenshot of the build configuration and pieced together an answer for $cc:

Hi, as you can see in the screenshot below, TEST has the most recent version. As per your request, to have the same version everywhere we should either rollback TEST or deploy to PROD.  
Let me know how to proceed.

Their answer? ""Okay""

Tl;dr: non-tech guy goes full monkey brain and reads only half of the version number, thinking we somehow inverted the release order for some obscure reason",33,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEF91220>

85,It Blew Up,"This happened a few years ago, when I was still help desk at my client, a government contract. I had the usual sorts of calls from our users (99% internal, with the occasional call on our outside line from others who used apps that the client supported).

We shared a laugh, because they understood what my immediate assumption was. I got their info, sent off the ticket, and then had a fun story to share with friends and coworkers.

87,Storage guy meet old server a tale of IT TomFoolery,"long time reader first time poster here. I have 25 years experience (yea I’m old) as a Dba. I’m now what most would consider a tier 3 support as in call me when all hope is lost.   


I currently work for a large global shipping company.  As happens the powers that be have decided it would be cheaper to have support done on a global level rather than a local level. So while our servers are here in North America SAN support it half way around the world. Not really all that great when you know you have to actually have to physically be on the server. Now you all are thinking, what your not using virtual servers? In this case no.    


See the servers in question were originally made back in about 1999/2000.  The software on them that our database uses was released the year I had my second kid. Said second kid is turning 21 in 6 months. To say this stuff is old is an understatement. We do not breath on this system, do not look at it and we do not updated it or reboot it. In other words DO NOT TOUCH IT. 

Today I start to get messages from our home grown monitoring (there is no monitoring system left that can monitor this old stuff) that the databases on that server are down. I was hopeful we were decomming them and no told me. Alas, nope they are down because they can no longer write to their files. Uhm that’s weird. Contact the only admin that can work on these old things and he is like either it’s an HBA issue or someone has yanked the disks. Oh joy my day is about get fun.

About an hour later ye old admin tells me the following:

The SAN team in country half around the globe got an error on one of the drives so they got jr SAN guy here in North America to go in and replace the storage cables on the old as heck server. Jr pulled the cables from the live production server because SAN team told him there would be no outage.  There is even a sign on the server that says DO NOT TOUCH.  SAN team on other side of globe told him to ignore that sign and  replace the cables.  

Yep Jr pulled storage cables from a prod server during the day without letting the admins know or doing any paperwork.   The old server is now requesting it’s final vacation and refuses to come up.  Said old server does not have an ILO either so any and all reboots are blind unless the admin drives 2 hours to the DC to attach a crash cart to it.  For you youngins, attach a keyboard and monitor directly to the server.

We have no back up plan if this server has decided to take its final nap.  I feel no remorse for the people using this app on this sever as they have been told for the better part of 10 years to get off it and they refuse because upgrading will be too expensive.  We cannot even eBay for parts because this thing is so old. 

Moral of the story here if it says do not touch DO NOT TOUCH IT and contact someone who isn’t half way around the world to see if you should touch it.",60,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF03B460>
88,Works better when plugged in,"Happen couple months ago, I went to a client site to fix issue with wireless network and realize that the printer in one of the department was unplugged from the network. I fixed it, one of the staff members who i shall call Jane thanked me saying it was down for a while and now she can finally print. 

Few weeks later, get an email from Jane saying the department can't print anymore. I checked the printer, realized there was an ip conflict and fixed her issue. 

Few days later Jane's departmemt manager who I shall call Karen sends an email saying that staff cant print and the printer always having issue and they want a new printer. I responded letting her know the previous issue was that network cable was unplugged and the second time was an ip conflict and nothing is wrong with printer but I will look into it. 

Contacted the staff to see what the issue was... Printer wasnt installed on the laptop. Installed, now they can print 

One month later Jane email they can't print because it low on toner. My company sent the toner to them. Month later Jane sends email again they can't print. Then Karen emails saying this always happening with that print, that it is not working and demands it be replaced with a new one and says how my company only patching a broken printer that needs to be replaced. I again explained that nothing wrong with the printer and again point out why they couldnt print with the past issues. 

I again look into it. Apparently printer out of ink and no one installed the new toner that we sent them a month ago. I had one of their staff do it an printer was operational again. 

Few weeks pass by Jane sends emails to Karen telling her they cant print. Karen send email demanding printer be replace and that it constantly breaking down. I pulled up my previous email chain with the past issue and resolution, forwarded that to her letting her know nothing is wrong with the printer. 

I called to speak with Jane but was informed no one was in at the moment in that department. Decided i'll try back later. 

Another manager at Karen company who i shall call Karena email my boss agreeing with Karen demanding printer be replaced and this was an ongoing issue. 

I replied to the email letting Karena and my boss know that i tried reaching Jane or anyone in the department but no one was available. Also included my previous email chain showing nothing was ever wrong with the printer 

At some point during the day my company sent a copier tech to check the printer. Tech sent his update to one of our sales rep who then emailed Karen and Karena letting them know problem was fixed but forgot to remove the attachment pic of copier tech ticket. 

I read the notes in the pic and i quote ""nothing is wrong with the printer, it works fine but works even better when plugged into the power outlet""",20,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEFCA550>

Our shop had a sister store (the 'parent' store) in a nearby city. We rarely ever saw staff from the other store, and more rarely saw the owner. In the one year I worked there I saw the owner twice.

That said, we did a lot of business for a semi-rural county and we sold lots of whitebox PCs to local businesses. We also sold lots of software. Lots and lots of software.

One day in late spring several cases of software showed up along with the proof for next week's newspaper ad.

200 copies of Office 97 Professional and according to the ad it's on sale starting the next week for....$219?!?

HOLY GUACAMOLE!!!!

I bought one. The manager bought one. All the employees bought one. Our friends and family....it was a Clippy^(TM) lovefest!

The ad hit on Tuesday (IIRC) and we sold every copy by Friday.

We figured it was a one shot deal but we called up to the mothership and asked if any more were coming and to our amazement more were already enroute. We got another 200+ copies, the sale ran for one more week, and at the end of that week they went to regular price of...

$249?!? 👀

We were told the boss got a really good deal. That lasted for months. Our 'sale' price became the normal price. We had a bank call up and order 150 copies. Another local business ordered 200. For the first two or three months we sold out almost every week then it slowed down to a steady 10-20 copies a week.

With that volume of sales you expect the occasional call of 'hey I'm trying to reload my Office and it isn't reading the discs.' For the average single copy owner we would tell them to swing by and we'd give them another copy we burned if they brought us their Office 97 box with the license key.

But then one day we got this call.

>C: ""Hey, this is Ann over at <business>, and I'm trying to load office on a new machine and the disc isn't working.""  
>  
>Tech 1: ""Oh yeah, that happens sometimes. Just open another box and use that disc.""  
>  
>C: ""I did that. I've tried 5 of them now and they are all doing the same thing. Failing on disc 2 reading the same file.""  
>  
>Tech 1: 🙄 *<yeah, sure they are...you didn't open a new box, you're just lazy.>*""That's wierd. Maybe they had a bad batch of resin or a scratch when they were being pressed. Well, tell you what, swing by and we'll give you a copy of disc 2 that works.""  
>  
>C: ""Great! See you in a bit.""

Some days pass.

>Junior Tech: ""Hey I got a call from <*another business*\> and they couldn't get their Office to re-install.""  
>  
>Tech 1: ""Did you tell them to clean the CD drive or try another disc?""  
>  
>JT: ""Yeah, they did that and said they tried several discs from different boxes and they all did the same thing.""  
>  
>Tech 1: ""That's wierd. Hey SampleSize?""

Tech 1 relays the story to me. So I ask the other two techs and lo and behold we've all had quite a few of these calls over the last few weeks.

I called the parent store and talk to the purchasing manager. He tells me they just found out there was a big run of bad discs pressed and they'll send us several cases of new Office discs to replace the bad one.

Okay....

Two days later the company van shows up driven by the parent manager and unloads SIX (6) ***LARGE*** cases of all new retail Office 97. I think there were 144 units per case.

>M: ""Yeah, so <owner> just wanted to recall the others so you need to call all the business customers and get them to swap out their boxes for these ones.""  
>  
>Us: ""*WTH?* Do you know how much work that will be?*""*

>M: ""Not my problem. That's what <owner> said. We have to do the same thing. Have fun!""  
>  
>Us: <glares of death>  
>  
>Start making calls.

As businesses start bringing in their copies (or more usually having us come one site and swap them out), Junior Tech decides to pop open one of the new boxes for some reason.

>JT: ""Hey SampleSize, take a look at this. Does this look wierd?""

Shows me Office 97 CD with a visibly off center laber and you can see the ink dots on the label from the printing process.

>SS: ""Uhh.....Where did you get that?""  
>  
>JT: ""From this box right here. One of the new ones <manager> brought last week.""  
>  
>SS: ""Go grab a couple of the returns and another new box from a different case and open them all up. Lay all the discs on the counter.""

>JT: ""Sure! What's wrong.""

>SS: ""I think we're all going to prison.""

>JT, Tech 1, Tech 2: ""Wait....what?""

***Epilogue***

So after <local manager> had a few calls with <parent manager> and the owner told us to not worry about it, some decisions were made by some people at the parent store to collect lots of documentation and make a couple of other phone calls.

Apparently the owner had connected with some guy who could get software at a really good price and thought this was a great way to make a fast buck.

I heard a couple years later via the rumor mill the owner was somewhere in Central or South America. I believe there were at least two warrants out for him.",37,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF0301F0>
90,Hit my breaking point today,"Quick background...

I work for a very large computer company that ships servers worldwide.  I am in charge of RMA/RCA and will try to help customers online to avoid returns.

Last month, customer orders a series of systems with an older OS which is close to EOL even after being spoken to about this at length.

Once systems are installed the customer decides to update BIOS to a non approved version and breaks the logging process.  Fan sensors no longer reporting.  Customer calls in ticket on Friday.  I spent all weekend creating a patch to fix the issue.

This morning, customer refuses to install the patch or cold boot the systems and wants to replace all servers at my companies cost.

It's only 9:00 am and I am already done for the day.",162,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF01AE20>
91,Image Resolution,"I work for msp level 1, 2, 3 because they expect us to do it all and recently I heard my boss tell someone, that I handle level 4 issues. Not sure what 4 does but I don't get pay enough for this, but seriously, can someone tell me what's L4? 

Anyways, one day user calls, one of the newer tech answers. Few minutes into the call she gets fustrated and ask if I can intervine. 

I take the call and ask whats the problem. Caller explains she got a picture that she is trying to print full page but it's not taking up the full page

I remotely connect to pc, have her show me the picture she wants to print. I open word, blow it up full page and send it to print.

Caller then ask if she have to edit it everytime to print full page and that she use to just open the picture, was able to select different sizes like wallet or full page and it would do it automatically but the application didn't do it anymore

So i double click pic and windows photo app opens, options are there to select different sizes. I try wallet works fine, i select full page image doesnt expand to full page. I check image properties, resolution something like 267x577.
I explain to here becauee resolution is so small when she selects full page it will only blow it up to max size of the actual pic resolution.

Caller not understanding starts ranting she was able to do it before.
I again explained it to her, i even went on google, downloaded a high res image something like 3000x2000 and demonstrated it to her that it does do full page for high res image but not for low res and she will have to edit it and blow up low res images.
She again argues she was able to do it and starts putting blame on us saying after we did whatever to there systems it doesnt work anymore.

Confused for a moment about what she talking about, then remembered that her company had win7 pc which were recently replaced for win10. So i explained to her computers were replaced she using win10 now and in win7, photo app may have done that and blown it full page also making it pixellated but now win10 only blows image up to max res when full page selected. She then insist she wants to go back on win 7. I told her no she can't
She then repeats her question why picture doesnt show full page. I again explain the resolution issue and demonstrated again with another high res i again downloaded that it works but for low res, she will have to manually blow up to fit full page.
She continues to go on about ""this is the way"" she been doing it before and don't see why she have to manually edit anything and blamed us for changing the system.

I put phone on mute and start banging it on the desk

At this point the new tech is laughing at me.

I then unmute and start speaking in a loud no BS tone to the caller. Asked her to show me were she got the image from. She pulls up an email with several picture attachment all with low res downloaded from internet. Simply told her all will have the same issue and that whenever she downloading pic from Internet in the future, download high res image and the way win10 photo app handles the pic is by design and that there is nothing else i can do for her and to have a nice day

Moment she said ok, i ended the call",93,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF01A9A0>
92,"You're fired, Denise!","tl:dr at bottom cross-posted from r/sysadmin by the request of u/harrywwc 

I work for an MSP and had a trouble ticket on Monday afternoon. Client states, internet and phones are down. They have not worked since Friday. Their company IT guy is out on PTO. Apparently his daughter gave birth. 

Ok. I drive out to their location and get to work. Corporate IT is prepared. He left them with a binder of  documentation and passwords. I have every password and diagram I could ever need. I hope they lock that up when not in use. 

I get shown the network closet. I find a tiny Sonicwall. I dislike Sonicwalls. I notice it's got a note on it. ""If internet stops working unplug power cable and plug back in."" Apparently this happens often. What could it hurt? I power cycle the Sonicwall. No change.

There's no place to work in the closet so I find an empty desk and connect my laptop to the network. I try to get to the Sonicwall GUI. No dice. I hope this firewall isn't dead.

I find out what the WAN address is, set up my laptop with it and head to the closet. I plug the cable that was in the WAN port into my laptop, still nothing. That's odd. I double check the cables. The cable that was on the wan side is going to a switch and the lan side is going to isp equipment. Dang it. switch them to the proper port and check the wifi. Internet access.

Double check with users onsite and phones and internet is back up. Owner overhears me talking to the front desk about what happened. Asks for clarification. He says that he knows exactly who is to blame. It was Denise.

The internet went down Friday. Denise went in to try and fix it. She ignored the note and instead swapped the ethernet cables. She then proceeded to come out of the closet and ask which cable she was supposed to unplug. They tell her and she says, ""OK. We're good."" and leaves for the day. 

Best part is that Monday she called out because she got wasted over the weekend and didn't feel well.

&#x200B;

tl:dr User swaps cables from firewall causing a two day outage for business. Calls out wasted so she doesn't have to face her mistake.",53,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF01ABE0>
93,Who called 911?,"A little background, I'm mid level IT, i support desktop computers, end point stuff. We're a small team, 3 of us, people stick around a long time here. Last guy retired after twenty years, i slid into his spot. Although it wasn't his job, he had background in telephony, so when the company needed to update to voip, he was a key figure. We aren't large enough to have a dedicated telephony guy, we have a vendor, but they are slow and $$$, we try to fix things in house first. Since my job is desktop, and i don't have a telephony background i'm learning as i go.. 

This story started yesterday, i get a call from Manager A, he wants to know if i can track the source of a call.. I say probably, what time? He tells me between 120 and 140, someone called 911, hung up, then didn't claim responsibility when cops showed up..  Awesome I say.

I go to our call logs, i find no calls to 911, go to another report, again, can't find calls to 911. I go back to him, are you sure they came to right place? yes he says, they even called back the number and got a different managers voicemail.

I get the number he told me they said popped up on caller ID. It doesn't match anything we own. I call my phone company to confirm all the numbers we are paying for, dial the 1 analog line we are paying for at that location, i reach the voicemail 911 called.. cool.. well at least i know the number that called 911 for sure.

I have no idea how someone at our site that is 100% voip, managed a call on an analog line. I call 911 dispatch center, leave a voicemail asking for additional information. Decide to try and trace the analog line from where it enters the building to a cube, maybe there's a non voip phone i'm not aware of.

Today:

Can't trace the line, it's plugged into a router, which is there for backup 911 service if our primary gateways are out of service, the phones are supposed to connect to this one instead. New question.. how did a call get placed through this gateway even though call manager never went down? WHAT IS HAPPENING??

Manager for 911 calls back, we talk, he's friendly, says he'll run a report for all calls recently from my number.  He tells me 3 times, first, a month ago.. my test call, then 2 other times in the last week. He also tells me the specific time stamps of the calls.

This broke it open, my test call came from this number also, somehow, 911 calls from this location are all routing through the backup gateway. 

I ran my search again knowing the correct timestamps and locate the devices the calls came from.  2 different people, 1 working from home even.. looks like they started dialing, then paused, then started again, forgetting they already entered a 1 for the number. Instead of staying on the line and saying it was a mistake, they hung up. Then cops came, oi. Or the user is f\*\*\* with us.

Turns out i didn't find the calls yesterday because the times were off on the report i was looking at, and as i can only search max 60 minute windows, i chose the wrong windows to look at. Also my other large report doesnt include these calls for some reason.. so not i have another thing to sort out.

In the end, 2 days to locate someone who didn't want to take 5 minutes to tell 911 and their own manager their mistake. And now I probably have another weeks worth of work looking into how to update our system so leadership is notified of every 911 call automatically, coorindating purhcase request for vendor, scheduling, installation!

Never a dull moment in my IT department! I still love my users though!",92,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF01A190>
94,Costumer lies about me,"Seriously everytime i think about this woman i get a little infuriated so maybe I can vent a little here. Around ten years ago i worked at tech support for a cable and internet company. 
We had quite a lot of older costumers calling in for just about anything. If someone called in and they just had the tv set to the wrong AV channel we were supposed to refer them to the company who made the tv or the shop where the person bought their tv. Usually we would help out anyway because to call the manufacturer was EXPENSIVE, but the bosses didn't like it and we Could get repercussions for it.
So this old lady called in and if course her tv was supposed to be set at HDMI1 but was at HDMI2. I seriously tried to help her for almost an hour, but she refused to press any of the buttons, refused to listen to me and asked if she could speak to a man several times. I actually gave up one of my unpaid brakes to help this woman. 
After such a long time my manager said i had to move on and i asked as politely as i could if she had anyone who could help her with her tv and it would be fairly simple fit someone in the room. She said she could ask her neighbor and that was that .. i thought. 
About ten minutes later one of the bosses calls me to his office. I thought he was mad that I spent so long trying to help the old lady, but the second i sat down he asked if I was having an especially bad day today or something. I was really confused and said no. He then proceeded to tell me that the old lady had called in again right away and said i had yelled at her, called her stupid, hadn't even tried to help her and that i cursed at her. I was floored. My boss though it was strange since I had the highest customer rating in the whole call center and he had never heard me curse..  ever. 
He called my other colleague in and he said the lady was crying hysterically and he fixed her problem in like two minutes and that she listened to every thing he said.
My boss said he did believe me, but since it was a complaint and they couldn't check that i didn't do that to her (even though the guy next to me in the call center said he had been there the whole time and didn't hear me curse at anyone) they had to give me an official warning. I quit five days later.",55,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF01A070>
95,"No Karen, You have to go to cybersecurity for a password reset, yes i'm sure... no you're not going to get me fired Karen","So at stupid industries LLC... we have an IT department and a cyber security department.

&#x200B;

These two departments both have admin access to the entire system/network but cyber security falls under the security department and whereas we handle IT issues not related to security.

&#x200B;

One of the many things that Cyber Security handles is password recovery and password resets. Namely if you forget your password you have to march yourself down to cyber security's office and face them in person to get your password reset.

&#x200B;

The upside to this is that any issue related to passwords *isn't my problem*.

Yesterday i'm in the bat cave stoopervising the IT interns and running the help desk. I get a phone in call.

&#x200B;

""IT department, how can we help you?""

""THIS IS KAREN,  assistant VP of the Bean counting department""

&#x200B;

""How can we help you Karen?"" I ask.

&#x200B;

""YOUR STUPID SYSTEM isn't taking MY PASSWORD!""

&#x200B;

""OK Karen, can  you have an office neighbor take 5 seconds and try to log themselves into your computer to see if there's a problem with the computer?"" I ask.

&#x200B;

I patiently wait for the banshee to strong arm someone into doing it.

&#x200B;

""He got logged in just fine, it's just me""

&#x200B;

""Well Karen I think you're going to have to walk down to cyber Security to get your password reset"" I explain.

&#x200B;

""BUT I ALREADY CALLED YOU! WHY CAN'T YOU DO IT FOR ME?"" she shrieks. I swear I can hear her across the building.

&#x200B;

""I'm sorry Karen, Cyber Security handles password recovery, don't forget to take your company ID when you walk down to cyber security"" I explain.

&#x200B;

""At MORON Corp. the IT department handled password recovery over the phone, Why can't you DO IT?""

""Well Karen, here at stupid industries only cyber security can recover passwords"" I explain.

&#x200B;

""But they said they would write me up if came in another time to get a new password, Can you please do it for me?""

&#x200B;

""Well Karen I don't know what to say, But you're just going to have to go down to cyber security""

&#x200B;

""I""ll have your job for this you pimple faced nerd!""

96,C3P0 and Art Don't Mix,"This is an oldie, but a wowie-goodie.

The last couple of summers of high school, I worked under the table for an accountancy office.  (fact 1)  After high school I worked retail in an office supply store for a couple of years (fact 2), and was head-hunted for a Mac support position at an online catalog retailer.

I started training the week after Thanksgiving.  I got on the phones the week between Christmas and New Year's 1999.  I was seated at the desk of the Mac trainer (because shadow training was a thing then).

One of the first calls I had was from a woman who had received a brand new iMac and printer for Christmas.  She was a worship leader of some sort at her church and was trying to print out something inspiring and heart-warming because the winter of 99 was a bad one wherever she was and she wanted to evoke Spring early in the New Year.

Except the graphics she was adding to her newsletter weren't showing up.

We reinstalled drivers.  

We reinstalled her publishing software.

We tried different USB ports.  Even tried going through the keyboard USB port.

We tried cleaning the print cartridges (even though they, like the printer, were brand new, and the cleaning cycle on Epson inkjets at the time were tremendously wasteful processes.)  

We tried *replacement* ink cartridges, because someone had the foresight to send her extras.

At this point I've got both support managers listening into the call, both trainers leaning over my shoulder, and a good handful of the team milling about trying to offer suggestions.  I was about to process an RMA for the printer when something she stated out of pique caught my attention.

**Church Lady**:  I just don't get it.  Where the graphic is supposed to be is wet.

(needless to say she never mentioned this before)

**Me**:  *latching onto that*  Say that again please?  What do you mean wet?

**CL**:  Well it's a newsletter, which I think I've already said.  I just love flowers - daisies are my favorite - so I wanted a few daisies on the page for spring-y feelings, you know?

**Me**:  Ma'am, out of curiosity, are your daisy images black line art?

**CL**:  Oh no honey, they're full color.  Just a beautiful yellow.  You wouldn't know they weren't photographs, this technology is so amazing!

**Me**:  And you say the page is wet.

By this point, her frustration had waned and she's just answering questions in between stories about her church, her grandkids etc.

**CL**:  Yeah, right where the flower is supposed to be.

*lightbulb*

**Me**:  Ma'am, what color is your paper?

**CL**:  Why, goldenrod, of course!

...

...

**Me**:  Ma'am, you can't print yellow flowers onto yellow paper.  That's like using a blue crayon on blue construction paper.  It just won't work.

I had to mute my phone because of all the people laughing behind me.

Later, someone asked me how I knew what in the hell color ""goldenrod"" was.

Well, outside of C3P0 being called that as a nickname pretty consistently in Star Wars, I'd worked with (facts 1 and 2) all different colors of color-specific corrective liquid.  

One was goldenrod, and it was a mix of near-nuclear yellow and orange.",79,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF01A220>
97,Stupidity isn't always from users,"In this company (a higher education establishment), IT contractors were more the rule than the exception. Management had some queer ""it's best we get some experts in"" attitude. Anyway, there was me ([ASP.NET](https://ASP.NET), IIS, SQL Server, MS full stack) and a bunch more, covering nearly all bases. The in house people were mostly field engineers.

Imagine our chagrin when an email came in for ""all ICT contractors"" that due to an administrative error, our times hadn't gone through...so we wouldn't be getting paid until next week. It was from some woman in payroll, the type that's fresh out of college, more interested in that cute guy in accounting and her hair than in doing her job.

To say the shit hit the fan would be like saying water is wet. In the contract were, as standard, terms of termination. One of them was ""Should the Company be late providing recompense for a period greater than fourty eight (48) hours from the end of the agreed weekly date, the Company defaults with all liability and the Employment terminates."" In its exact entirety. Defaulting with liability is a termination of contract with all money owed \*and would be payable\*, the entire wages for the contract. Some of us had all possible bonuses included with that, some didn't.

So we get together and I draw the short straw, and I'm elected to speak for all of us. (ALWAYS DO THINGS COLLECTIVELY! FFS PEOPLE! Don't take on a HR department of 100 people by yourself!)

I get in touch with the head of ICT and read out that line of the contract. He stopped, read it himself, then called payroll to confirm it was true, reading out the contract and then stating what the damage to the company would be. He then retired to his office. The company's options then were to either get us paid, to default on the contracts and pay us off, or to be in breach of contract; With how many of us there were and our wage, the latter option would have been into the low millions with punitive damages added to lost wages and fines. A plain as day claim against a company via tort law rarely ends well for the company, breach of contract frequently attracts punitive damages, in employment cases, it also attracts fines. It's a far more expensive prospect than even a wrongful dismissal claim.

Now the head of ICT had a lovely air conditioned soundproof office but I could see his face very red and his mouth very shouting. Whoever was on the other side of the phone was not enjoying themselves. This guy, who sat at executive level, was going berserk. He came out, closed the door neatly behind him, adjusted his tie and cleared his throat.

""I'm sorry people. The call you got earlier was in error, but let me explain. Some useless excuse of humanity in payroll who we used to employ did indeed make a mistake. Then she made a further mistake by not telling her supervisor and going straight to you. I just got off the phone with her supervisor with assurances that the problem, both problems, that is the idiot in payroll and your fair pay, both problems are solved.""

He's a pretty off-the-cuff guy but can put on a good speech when he wanted to, but we knew he was dying to laugh. We all burst out laughing after a few seconds. True enough, the moron office admin woman got fired for gross negligence and the payroll supervisor got written up for letting it happen. As he explained later, even though we were contractors, we were ""his team"" and he wasn't about to let anyone ""screw you over and get away with it, that's my job"".",76,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF01A5E0>
98,Woman doesn't listen to my warning before accidentally bashing her head open with an amplifier.,"I used to work for a company that supplies overhead music to big business chains (Think Target, Starbucks, Hot Topic, etc.) My department provides technical support to stores when their music isn't working. Now, I don't have a LOT of tech service stories because of how our system works. When something goes down in a store, we're not talking to some Area Manager Karen who's ready to scream at us for the music being down. Rather, we have to troubleshoot with the store's themselves. So if we're calling a Starbucks location, it's going to be some uninvested barista or assistant manager that couldn't care less that their system isn't blaring All I Want For Christmas Is You 20 times a day.

Mind you, that DOES mean that we have a hard time getting the people at the store to troubleshoot with us at all. So was the case with a Starbucks I called. The first three attempts went something like this.

OP: Hey there, My name is OP from (insert company name here). I'm reaching out today regarding your overhead music. Is a manager available to talk?

Store Manager: This is her. When is a technician coming out?

OP: Unfortunately I'm unable to send a tech out unless I verify some things with the system first. Do you have time to remote troubleshoot.

Store Manager: No, just send a tech.

\*Click\* BRRRRR

This happened a few times over the course of 2 days trying to call at all different times to try and catch the store at a less busy time. Unfortunately, due to company policy, we cannot send a technician out except for under two conditions.

1. New equipment needs to be installed
2. There's an issue that cannot be solved remotely.

Eventually on my fourth or fifth call, the manager finally relented. Once we get the store to agree to troubleshoot, it generally only takes five minutes. We have very simple setups. A music player connects to the internet for playlist updates and also feeds music to an amplifier. The amp sends the music to the speakers in the store. If you can hook up a video game console, you can hook up one of our players, and even the least tech savvy person can usually follow along with our instructions for troubleshooting. So, we begin.

OP: Great! Are you able to locate your music player and amplifier?

Store Manager: No, I don't know where they are.

OP: ...Have you ever changed the volume of the music in your store?

Store Manager: Yes, there's a box with a little knob.

OP: That's the amplifier.

Store Manager: Well how was I supposed to know that?

I rolled my eyes and apologized for not being clearer, but continued anyway.

Store Manager: It's up on a shelf too high. I can't reach it.

OP: Well...how do you reach it when you want to change the volume?

Store Manager: I get a step stool, but I don't know where it is right now!

I try my best not to sigh in exasperation as she tries her very best to insist that there's no way she can troubleshoot. She just repeatedly asks if I can send a tech and whines about not being able to reach the equipment.

OP: Ma'am, I'm sure you'll find the step stool if you look.

Store Manager: Fine then, I'll just use my chair.

Huge red flag went up.

OP: I'd advise against that, ma'am, it might not be stable.

SM: I think I'm perfectly capable of standing on a chair, thank you.

OP: Ma'am, some of that equipment is very heavy and it's not safe to use a chair to reach it for troubleshooting.

SM: Listen, why don't you stick to doing your job and not worry about what I'm doing, okay?

After she says this, I hear some skidding noises coming from the other end of the phone.

OP: Is everything alright?

SM: I'm fine, just rolling my office chair to the shelf.

OP: Ma'am, please don't stand a chair with wheels.

She ignored me completely and just asked ""Okay, so what am I-""

She was abruptly cut off as I hear a loud Thud followed by an even louder CRASH!

OP: Ma'am, are you okay?

No answer...

I try in vain for about a minute to call out to the woman on the other end, steadily getting more and more worried that she's seriously injured. Eventually someone ELSE picks up the phone.

Barista: Hey, so uh...she can't come back to the phone right now, her forehead is bleeding.

OP: What happened?

So not only did she fall off the chair onto her back, but she had brought the amplifier WITH her. Our amplifiers are about the size of an xbox and the corners are NOT rounded. It had landed on it's corner on her forehead while she was lying prone on the ground.

After a few moments of stunned silence, not knowing where to go from here, I simply ask. ""Is the amp disconnected from everything else""

Barista: Yeah?

OP: Cool...then this counts as an install. I'm sending a technician. Have a nice day.

\*Click\* BRRRRR

I take a moment to recover before going back to making outbound calls. Luckily, the store never calls to complain about that interaction and I continue on with my day, acting as if it never happened.

99,"Help! My password reset locked me out (of an unrelated system)! No, I won't stay on the phone, just fix it!","I manage a system for about 400 users, and every three months for compliance purposes we have to force password resets. We have detailed instructions, complete with pictures, that we send out to every single user the day of the password reset, then do the reset in the late afternoon. We have had the exact same password reset procedure for about two years now, so this isn't anything new.

Thankfully I have not had to deal directly with users in a while, but I interact daily with the people who do, and we're sharing a Teams space where we bitch about work all day to each other, so I got to watch this from a nice safe distance.

We reset passwords on Friday evening. Yesterday Ms. Difficult called, and I knew it was going to be a treat to deal with her.

For some background, Ms. Difficult seems to know a GREAT DEAL about a lot of her job. She's great with customers, great with actual legally required knowledge for this field. To say she's not great with tech is an insult to people who say they're not great with tech and make an effort. Until I transitioned away from a user-facing job, I was her go-to for EVERY issue, especially ones that weren't part of my department. I'd reiterate that it wasn't my department and tell her who to reach out to, but she always came back to me. She always calls, never responds to emails, and works remotely from everyone else in her management structure. By the time that group hired a new manager, I had a spreadsheet of phone call logs that I made, including detailed notes about what the call was about, how long it was, and the resolution, which always ended up leading into another call later. I was on the phone or working issues for this woman five hours a week. One user. It did get a bit better when the manager came on, but this woman still can't handle technology at all.

On to yesterday. I knew Ms. Difficult would be difficult and warn my team on our morning call. I told them all the exact issues I've worked with her on password resets in the past. Ms. Difficult predictably calls in and one of the newer folks answers. Lana (not her real name) may be new, but she is On It and is working her ass off to know her shit. She's good, and takes no shit from anyone. She tells Ms. Difficult to open the procedures we send out every time and walk through her with it. Ms. Difficult insists she's done this and can't find a code verification button. This is a new one to me, but it could be because she was trying to log in through another location (more on that in a bit). Says she's going to try to figure it out on her own, she'll call back later.

As to the wrong location...the system I manage can only be accessed for our users within another system. Some people who use this system can log in from a website and full functionality, but due to my company's unique setup, our users can't. The password reset, however, has to be done via the website. Annoying, but that's how it is.

Ms. Difficult calls back later in the day, after Lana has left for the day. John (again, fake name) takes the call. John has been in this department the longest. He knows his shit forwards, backwards, and sideways. He offers to call Ms. Difficult on Teams and share screens so he can walk her through the sticking points. She says she's locked out of the system and can't log in. He asks a few more questions, and it turns out it's the other software she's locked out of. And she's saying it's our software that did it.

This is absolutely impossible. That's like saying resetting your EA Origin password somehow locked you out of Steam. That's not how it works. At all.

John got with the department that actually manages that password and had them unlock her account. Still had a Teams call going, but she kept putting him on hold and asking to call back later. It's after 5:30 for John, so he clocked out and left it until today. It was only 3:30 for Ms. Difficult, but she is fully aware that we're two hours ahead. She works obscene hours anyway.

This morning there's already an email from Ms. Difficult when I got online at 8AM. Turns out she locked herself out of the other software. Again. And is demanding we unlock it for her.

Lana gets on a call with the other department, they unlock it again, and Lana emails Ms. Difficult and says it's done, she can log in with her existing password. Which, somehow, despite using it daily, Ms. Difficult can't remember. So now she has two passwords to reset, and is asking the wrong department for help. Again.

I think somehow they did get it figured out, and they're also compiling everything to send on to Ms. Difficult's manager, along with recaps of all the phone calls. And we'll do it all again in another 90 days.

So glad I don't interact with users any more.",88,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF01ADC0>
100,A user informed me the other day that he was having trouble making it to the Windows log in page,"In the ticket, it mentioned some boot Mgr error which seemed legit. I went over to investigate and thankfully the dude was actually in his office. Because of covid posture it's kind of a nightmare sometimes to get a hold of people. So he fires up the PC, and we get to the circling dots below the Windows logo during boot up. I ask him if this is the furthest he's ever made it during the boot and he says yes. A couple seconds later and the PC survives until the log in screen. Dude swore the thing wasn't working. He even threw out a piece of paper that he fished out of the trash to show me the exact error message. I believed him, so he's like let's turn it off and on again to see if it'll fail this time. While this is happening, my day one apprentice grabbed the dudes Rubik's cube and just starts going to town. I timed him, he solved the thing in 30 seconds, just as the PC made it to the log in screen a second time. Both of us were kinda baffled but I just said, ""Dude, I'm sorry we couldn't fix your computer, but at least we solved your Rubik's cube.""",64,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEFDFE80>
101,"My passwords not working, but I’m not gonna listen to you when you suggest waiting for it to reset.","So I work help desk. It fucking sucks. Yesterday was a super slow day cause almost all of the would-be callers were on holiday which I loved. 

But even though it was the easiest day I’ve had in a long time, it still couldn’t have saved me from the frustration of this one lady. 

So it started when I got a call from her about a password reset, no biggie. This might be a bad habit, but since I’ve been in tech support for a while, I know what needs to be fixed right when the person says. After that, I just mute them so I don’t have to hear their sob story. 

So like if you call and say “I need a password reset.” Then we’re good. If you want to give me a long sob story where you drone on about meaningless bullshit, we’re gonna have problems and I will put low effort and complain about how stupid you are online. 

But anyways, this lady took an eternity blabbering on while I was silently waiting for her to finish. I couldn’t tell you what she said, cause again I had my volume turned down. 

But after that when she was finally done, I was already ready to reset her password and tell her over the phone. 

The interaction went a little something like: 

Me: “Okay, Ma’m I have your new password ready.” *gives her the password* 

Woman: (right after being given the password) “It’s still not working.”

Me: “Okay well, just try waiting about 10 minutes and the password should sync up, it should be working then.” 

Woman: *Completely disregarding what I just said* “My password isn’t working.”

Me: (repeateding myself, and my voice becoming more stern) “I just said wait about 10 minutes. 

Woman: “My password still isn’t working”.

And in my seething rage, I was saved when the call was dropped. You can believe what you want, but I’m not one to intentionally hang up on someone (more because of fear of getting punished more than anything else)… but I ain’t calling back.

103,Brown Pants Moment at the Gym,"This is my first post here, and I want to preface this by saying I am in NO WAY a professional at IT. I know just enough to troubleshoot some basic issues. Also on mobile so please excuse the formatting.


This took place maybe 8 years ago. For a little backstory, I used to do men's gymnastics (relevant so bear with me) and in addition, I was also unofficially responsible for implementing patches on the mats, (small children would love to pick at stitching, that and general wear and tear from use). I ended up getting an injury that meant I couldn't really do much, so I helped my coach out around the gym even more. I did things like greasing the bearings in the adjustable bars, cleaned out air filters, and could help point to where a problem might lie in electronics.


One night after practice, my coach asked if I could look at the gym's computer as it was being slow. I immediately agreed as my coach was a second father to me, and also made sure he understood that I would do what I could, but I was not a professional. I knew just enough to know when I was out of my depth. My coach gave me the go ahead so I first asked for a list of every task that computer was used for. After installing some freeware to clean up some space, I also turned off a few of the advanced graphics settings as they weren't needed. After finishing, I told my coach I had done what I could, and he thanked me and I went home.


A day or so later, I get a phone call from my coach. Here's the relevant parts of that call:

Coach: ""What did you do to my computer!?""


This statement was followed by the longest 3 seconds of my entire life. I was immediately worried I had somehow ruined it. And this call came when I had not had the fortune to be wearing brown pants!


Coach: ""It runs so much better now, thank you!""

Me: Don't scare me like that! I about had a heart attack thinking I had broke the PC! I only did some minor cleanup and turned down the graphics settings since you didn't need them.


TL;DR: Gym's computer is running poorly, get offered to take a look, do some light clean up and lower graphics settings. Get called a day later and initially fear that I ruined the gym's computer.",62,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF01AFD0>
104,Computer went BOOM,"This is not my first post and it happened over two years ago when i worked somewhere else as the main support guy at a research facility.

Long story short I had the long-time-task to fix all computers that did not complete a TSM backup in a while. While most computers did not exist anymore or were simply turned off, quite a few had problems connecting to the control server.

So I was on investigation again to find myself in a dusty lab-storage room with around a dozen of old Optiplex 740s, 745s and 760s still running Windows XP and Windows 7 at the time most computers were already on Windows 10.

Most of them were turned on and had problems accessing the control server to make a backup.
Not this one. This one 740 was turned off. Turned off for quite some time. I connected the AC and was surprised not to die because this Optiplex exploded the moment i pushed the power on button. Needless to say i ticked this one of the list because the client got replaced.

**TLDR**: turned on a dusty computer and it exploded on the spot.",82,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF1C1B20>
105,"I don't need a ticket, I need a mouse","LONG time lurker.

**Back Story**

I work at a company as their only IT person. This company has been around for over a decade, but no one of the previous IT people thought a helpdesk solution was necessary. While (and I'm sure I'll get flack for this) I love helpdesk, it is a tiny part of my job and a responsibility that takes second or third place, under the IT governance, cybersecurity, and business application rolls I also hold. That said, my days are never boring and I found it difficult to keep the helpdesk requests at bay without having the users wait WAAY too long before response/resolution.

A couple weeks ago, I decided to help me (really them) out and install a helpdesk server application. I require tickets for every helpdesk request, so I can prioritize and resolve issues faster. A ticket is entered by the user sending the support mailbox an email. This is the exact same process as before, except they will receive an email back with their ticket number and I will get a notification in the control panel. 

A company-wide email went out with a week's notice before golive, requesting anyone with questions speak up that week. No one did. 

**The Story**

The day that the helpdesk program goes live (denoted with another company-wide notification), a user comes into my office, while I'm very obviously on a video conference call with corporate. 

User: hey. My [wireless] mouse stopped working. 

Me: OK, no problem. I'm on a call right now [pointing to my headset]. Can you send me an email, so the request will be added to my ticket queue? For now, there's an unused desk in your office with a wired mouse that you can use until I can get to your ticket. 

User: I just need a mouse. Can't you just get me one?

Me: I wish I could, but I can only act on tickets. I sent a couple emails about it throughout this past week and today.

User: I know. I read them. I just need a new mouse.

Me: you probably just need a battery, since your mouse is less than a year old, and I'm on a call right now [pointing to my headset]. Please send me an email, to automatically create a ticket, and I will get to it after my call with the CIO.

User: I don't need a ticket, though. I just need a mouse. 

Me: [getting quite irritated] Ma'am, believe me, I understand your frustration, but I *do* need a ticket or I cannot help you with you mouse, per the new policy. And, as I've mentioned, I'm on a call with the CIO. Please send me an email to add your request to my queue. In the meantime, you can use the wired mouse on the spare desk in your office. 

User: [almost yelling] FINE!

She storms out. 

I sigh to collect myself and returned to the call with the CIO, which I deliberately kept unmuted per his previous request. 

CIO: who was that? 

Me: I'd rather not say. But, if she gets worse, I'll let you know. Do you think I was wrong for not getting her all fixed up? I feel like I was. 

CIO: NO!! You have a new policy, which you communicated to your business team members. She needs to follow it. 

We continue our business. 

On principle now, I will not assist her without an email, since she would have sent me an email in the first place, had it not been a ""requirement"" now. This was last Monday. I'm still waiting for an email from her. I've seen her around the office, we spoke, and no mention of the wireless mouse issues. I hope she didn't bring a battery from home. I am a strict believed that the company must provide it's employees with the tools to do their jobs and, for me, that's IT equipment.


Edit: formatting and spelling. Mobile posts don't turn out great, do they?

Edit: I didn't actually display my frustration with her, though I was frustrated. Also, she is normally a very nice and thoughtful person. I think she was having an off day. I did go check on her to make sure she didn't result to using the trackpad. She did take the wired mouse from the neighboring desk, but she didn't submit a ticket, so I can't replace the wireless mouse.",125,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF1C1BB0>
106,The most awkward onsite service call I ever made.,"Years ago, sometime last century, I have my own computer consulting company. This eventually leads to me working exclusively in the manufacturing sector for around fifteen years. But this story is from before that when I perform over the phone and onsite service for a number of businesses. 

To put it in perspective, these are the days of Lotus 123 and WordPerfect. Microsoft Office is still a few years off. 

A clinic that provides urinalyses for new hires and truck drivers needs some help with a Lotus 123 template, and I am known for getting Lotus to do things that many think it shouldn't be able to do, and so come much recommended by one of my other customers who has a working relationship with this site. And it is a decent size project. On my third day straight working there the following happens:

I'm in final testing of the modifications to their spreadsheet when a young lady lab assistant approaches hesitantly and asks if I can help her. Being the helpful sort, I say, ""Sure. What do you need?""

Young Lady Lab Assistant: ""Please follow me...""

So I follow her and she takes me to the testing area and shows me a sample container full of urine. 

Young Lady Lab Assistant: ""If you look here on the side of the container, this temperature gauge shows that this sample was returned to us at room temperature. It's a cold sample. If it were a naturally produced one, it would be at least 97 F (36 C). It's the third cold sample this guy has returned today. Our protocols require us to actually watch him produce the next sample. But we have no guys in the building today, except you. I know it is not your job, but could we please have you watch him produce a sample for us?""

I am speechless. This is way outside anything that could be construed as my area of either expertise or interest. The closest I get to this is admiring the technology that lets the container tell you the temperature of the sample. But I also feel for the three young ladies working as lab assistants that day. I suspect this particular company doesn't pay nearly well enough for them to be closeted in a restroom with a rough and rugged trucker who clearly has something to hide, and whose job likely depends on him keeping it hid. But no matter how you slice it or what I answer, it's awkward as hell.

Sigh.

Young Lady Lab Assistant (using every last ounce of her charms): ""Please.""

With much trepidation I gallantly agree to help. 

So I find myself in a single user restroom with a short, plump (okay, fat), cranky trucker in his mid-fifties with an unkempt beard and unruly hair - at least he still has a fair amount of it. He is wearing overalls and is not at all pleasant with me.

Trucker who clearly has something to hide: ""So this is how you get off? Watching other men pee?""

Me: ""Nope. I really do not. But you have forced them to have to watch the sample being produced. So here we are.""

Trucker who clearly has something to hide: ""Here we are.""

He whips out his ... well, you know what he has to whip out about now. Let's leave it unsaid. He then starts waving it back and forth quickly.

Trucker who clearly has something to hide: ""Yeah. I may just get some of it on you."" 

Me, appalled at the threat: ""If you do, I will have you arrested for assault and I will press charges of both a criminal and civil nature. I will also declare this sample to be tainted and they will report back to your company that you were not cooperative and you will lose your job. I'd think hard about that decision if I were you."" 

I wasn't actually certain I could do any of that last part, but it sounded good. And with what the dude is threatening to do to me, you'd say whatever you had to to make it stop too.

He tries three more attempts to embarrass me or intimidate me, but we will keep this safe for work and say no more about it. I'm done with it.

Me: ""I'm about to leave and tell them that you don't want to keep your job. Or can we get this over with?""

Trucker who clearly has something to hide: ""Okay. But seriously, I can't give them this sample and keep my job.""

Me: ""No kidding. Otherwise you would not have brought enough clean urine to return three cold samples. That's not my problem.""

Tucker who clearly has something to hide: ""Yeah. But seriously. Can I pay you twenty dollars to fill this little container for me?""

Me, laughing: ""You've got to be kidding me! What makes you think my urine is clean?"" (It was, but how would he know that?) ""Get it done, or we are done here.""

Checkmate. With no joy or playfulness left, I watch him fill the container. After he zips up and washes up, I witness him return it to the lab assistant. She is satisfied that it is the right temperature. 

I never see him again and do not care what his fate is afterwards. I complete my testing of the spreadsheet in record time and submit my bill for service. I add $50 for the ""special"" assistance provided. After I receive my pay, I never visit that company again as a technician. I mean seriously, would you?",137,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF1C1C10>
107,A rapid descent into NOC hell...,"This happened several years ago when I sat NOC for a large international company you likely have never heard of.

In this company, the NOC was manned by Help Desk Tier 2 agents who managed tickets and monitored for and reported on outages and assisted changes. Sometimes, one agent would be on five bridges at the same time; There were several types available. A bridge could be for a change taking place either with or without our direct participation; or with technicians working on an outage; or with employees impacted by an outage; or with a client (many of whom you have definitely heard of) who had a stake in the part of the business impacted by the outage; or finally with vendors who provided a tool or an MPLS circuits involved in an outage. We had to be multitasking champions. 

We were assisted by Tier 1 agents who could do basic Help Desk tasks like password resets, and a much smaller team of Tier 3 agents who would manage the technician outage bridges and research and document the final root cause analysis for any outages. We were responsible for initial reporting and timely follow-ups of all issues.

In our beautiful NOC, we could monitor all the datacenters for temperature and power concerns. We would know when AC went out or generators were engaged at any of them. We could also access all of them visually via any security cameras installed.

The company had employed a relatively good level of redundancy in their topology. Wherever possible, there would be two MPLS circuits in place from different vendors, one held in reserve for an outage on the first and just waiting for the flip of a switch to be engaged. Some places (like Australia) there would only be one vendor, but still two circuits. All major systems had a second server that could be engaged. Like I said: a good level of redundancy.

Our three biggest datacenters with the most important systems in them were 1) the building we were in, 2) another major building 2,000 miles (3,200 km) away in another state, 3) our largest location in the Philippines. At that second one mentioned was where the servers for time keeping and ticket reporting worldwide were kept. 

Sometimes a site would send a ticket to report their employees could not login or logout of their shifts. If they also could not access the ticket system to send a ticket, they would call us instead, since it normally meant a break in MPLS connectivity. It would not be unusual to get a number of these calls at once from the same region, since they could all be served by the network. 

On the day in question, things had been relatively calm. We had been able to focus on closing out a number of less critical tickets and answer a lot of emails. It was a good day.

And then it happened.

A freak storm 2,000 miles away created the biggest mess I've ever seen at any of my IT jobs.

The wind kicked up to nearly tornado levels of intensity and the rain poured down. We were monitoring this on the weather channel. We always kept on eye on weather or political unrest that could impact any of our sites. This storm was serious. 

Then the first signs something had gone wrong. First one call, then two, then ten: People couldn't clock in or out and no one could open a ticket for it. As we tried to create tickets from the calls, we found we had lost connection to the ticketing system as well. We reached out in vain to the other state, but no one was answering. Meanwhile, Tier 3 told us to just throw everyone reporting the issues onto a bridge. 

We were now all hands on deck and still sixteen deep in queue. We were answering the calls and asking straight up if it was about the ticketing system or clocking in or out. If a yes to either or both, the were asked to hold and thrown on the bridge. Right in the middle of all this was a major shift change, but those of us from the morning shift stayed over so we were literally ALL hands on deck for a few hours.

By the time we finally started getting information from the other site, we likely had about 500 people from all over the planet on that bridge.

It would seem that a gust of wind had removed a large section of the ceiling and roof over our second largest data center and the rain was just pouring in. A quick and decisive set of actions by one of our VP's stationed there likely made recovery much easier: he had managed to immediately cut power to the data center without letting the UPS battery array or generators kick in. This was no small trick, as the system was designed to never let power go down. But he brought it down hard and fast. As soon as he had, the time keeping and ticketing systems were effectively gone. He spent the rest of the limited time available to him before the city made him evacuate the no-longer-fully-intact building throwing tarps over as many of the servers as he could. While I'm sure that every server in the building was no longer going to remain in service as long as they would have without this event, these quick actions on his part helped save the company tens of millions of dollars and likely enabled a much faster return to business as usual. 

It would still take about a week before business got back to anywhere near usual.

Timekeeping was manual and tickets were by email only for nearly five days. When the ticketing system returned, it had lost about 72 hours worth of data. All those tickets we had closed that day? Yeah, we got to do it all again. 

So if you really want to make your topology truly redundant, maybe don't put both your main server and your failover server for a critical system in the same data center. Because it likely won't ever happen again. But then, failovers are for those days when the impossible happens.",150,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF1C1C70>
108,What does that say exactly?,"Back when I was network supervisor/manager for a South Korean shipping company, I was at my first regional IT meeting where the high mucky muck from HQ came to give us a speech.

I am still responsible for maintaining those machines despite the fact every icon now has Korean text under it saying what it is. Luckily, unless they have happened to change the icon to something else, MS has the same icons across the various languages.

Now whenever there is an error message or problem pop up, I need to have the Korean manager try to translate the Korean text into an English. Imagine a driver telling the mechanic the error message says the engine will not run. What it really means is the engine will not run as it is out of fuel.

109,PhD student vs technician,"Hi guys, obligatory LTL, FTP. This just happened the past week.

I'm a last year PhD student working with bioinformatics. So of course since the word ""informatics"" is in there, I also unknowingly became the lab's IT support over the years.

Cannot run a command-line program? Sure, I'll help (translation: Google the error message). Oh a pandemic hit us and now we'll need to access every computer remotely? I guess I'm the only one who knows how to Google for that, too. Need to image a Linux or Windows machine? VPN not connecting? Hey, have you guys tried turning it off and on again?

Backstory to this post: last year, our department bought a very expensive microscope. At first we placed it in our lab as an immediate solution, but since it was meant to be shared by the entire department, it eventually had to be moved to a shared room. The microscope can be remotely controlled by the company's software, which needs to be individually installed by their technician in every machine we intend to use. So our plan was to move the microscope to the shared room along with a desktop computer to control it. Naturally, the company's technician would install the software, set up the connection between microscope and computer, and test that everything works properly in the new room.

Cue to this week's incident.

We are:

- $me - that's me!
- $tech - the company's technician
- $postdoc - the lab's post-doc who was accompanying $tech during his job
- $pi - the lab's PI (principal investigator, a.k.a. boss)

---

Prior to $tech's visit, I imaged a desktop computer that was lying around in the lab. I set up its remote access, set it to wake after power outage, all that good stuff. I explained to $postdoc and $pi that it was basically ready to install the microscope software and be moved to the new room. I asked them to let me know when $tech would come, so that I could be there to help if needed (my research can be done remotely so I'm not everyday in the lab). Of course they didn't do it.

I'm at home finishing my research for the day when at 5pm I get a message from $pi:

$pi: ""hey $me, $postdoc and $tech are struggling to make the computer work in the new room, can you help them? Cheers""

Against my better judgement I send $postdoc a message and ask what's up. Here's how it goes:

$me: ""hey $postdoc, $pi said you were having some trouble, is the computer working?""

$postdoc: ""hi $me, yeah everything was working fine, $tech installed the software and set up the connection to the microscope. But then we moved the computer to the new room, and now it is not turning on. We tried a lot of stuff and don't know what's up.""

So we go through some troubleshooting steps: are the cords plugged on the wall, are the LEDs on, does the monitor turns on, are the cables properly connected, have you tried every port, etc.

$postdoc: ""yeah, we tried everything. The monitor is fine, it just has no signal. Our guess is that the the PSU is dead. We first connected it to a 110V outlet and it was set to 220V, so maybe that's what caused it?""

Brief explanation: in my country, both 110V and 220V outlets are common even in regular houses (and yes, it's as messy as it sounds). Some devices only work at a given voltage, some devices can automatically transform from 110V to 220V, and some have a manual switch for this. The computer fits this last case.

Now, what $postdoc did was bad, but connecting 220V devices to 110V outlets shouldn't in theory nuke the PSU - not as bad as the other way around, anyway.

$postdoc: ""$tech even took it back to the old room, plugged it in the 220V outlet that it was previously connected to, and nothing happened. So yeah, we're pretty sure it's the PSU.""

At this point it was almost 6pm and $tech was heading out. In my head, I wasn't really buying the PSU thing, but I couldn't figure out the root cause without going to the lab and seeing for myself.

$me: ""ok I can go to the lab in a few days, then I'll check it out. Worst case scenario I take it to a repair shop.""

$postdoc ""ok, thanks $me.""

---

A few days later, I take the 50-minute drive to the lab. If the issue was really with the PSU I was kinda pissed that $tech apparently borked it, but whatever, let's see what's up.

I get to the lab, put my stuff on the desk and immediately go check on the computer. 

Surprisingly, I hear a faint whizzing coming from the case. Wait, *is the computer turned on?* I check the monitor and as $postdoc said, it's on but has no signal. I gaze back at the case, and then into the case, through the transparent acrylic casing. And then it hit me...

... *cue palm meeting face* ...

I move towards the back of the case, unplug the VGA cable from the motherboard port, and plug it back into the video card port.

Lo and behold, after 30 seconds of troubleshooting, I'm met by inspiring images of Windows landscapes in the monitor.

I send a picture of the working desktop to $pi and write: ""I'll send you my rates later by email"" - just joking of course. But maybe...

Now if I had a ticket system, I'd go with: ""$tech is defective, replacement needed.""

As for $postdoc, their words echoed my head: ""...we tried every port..."". Huh. Turns out users *do* lie.",69,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF1C1D30>
110,Windows cannot connect to the printer," This is a short little story (well it felt short to me) about the time I got to help with a printer problem at my school.

Cast and context:  
$Me: A quiet computer enthusiast/high school that actually has more than 2 friends  
$Librarian: The head librarian out of 3. Minor character.  
$SuperTech: The IT overlord of my school (This name will be relevant in future stories)

BEGIN!

So I'm in the school library, which also functions as a printing center. I'm not printing - instead assembling notecards into an accordion-like thing that uses obscene amounts of tape - but I notice that the computer in front of me is still booting Windows.

Granted, these machines are OLD. Thankfully Core i series and not Core 2, but a 3rd gen Optiplex *probably* has a hard drive in it, plus the HDD activity light is blinking. So I continue taping. 10 minutes later, still nothing.

More taping. It's now been 20 minutes. I'm almost done, just two more notecards left.

...it's still not booted. The HDD drive activity is no longer blinking, so I force-restart with the power button. I resume taping, and am on the last notecard when $SuperTech comes in. He talks to the head librarian and she mentions a printer problem.

Oh no.

I listen in.

$Librarian: ""...said that it wasn't printing at all, either M604 or M651."" (M604 is black and white, M651 is color. Both are laser printers.)

$SuperTech: ""Alright, did they say which one?""

$Librarian: ""No.""

As $SuperTech comes over to where I'm working, I mention that the machine I'm sitting in front of is booting for eternity. He goes into the tech office which is right next to the library, and comes out with a machine labeled ""LIBRARY PRINTER SPARE"" because apparently they just have a few spares. He sets it next to the desk and asks me ""can you hook this up"" so I do. Takes me about 2 minutes; just keyboard/mouse/display/power/Ethernet and put the monitor on top. It was already configured as the old one was, so I boot it up and we're good to go.

Back to the printers. He goes to test the other working machines by opening Chrome and printing the welcome screen, so the printer prints a bunch of Chrome welcome screen webpages. I've finished hooking up the spare, so I test too. Booting the machine next to me, we have ""Windows cannot connect to the printer"". Clicking ""More Details it gives a hex value. Error 0x0000004C or something like that. I open Chrome and try to print. No printers listed, just the Save to PDF and MS Print to PDF ones by default.

I call $SuperTech over and he stares at it for a few seconds.

$SuperTech: *barely audible* ""F\*\*\*ing printers.""

He goes through the basics - opens Chrome, Ctrl+P, printers dropdown, See More. Just Save to PDF and MS Print to PDF. This is logged into my permissions-lacking student account, so he logs out and logs into his account, with full permissions. Goes to Chrome, Ctrl+P, printers dropdown, See More. Save to PDF, MS Print to PDF... and a long name that seems to be garbage, but had M604 in it. $SuperTech selects it, Enter, and...

Nothing. So he goes into Windows' printer settings and re-adds them. They're back now, and printing works. He asks me to log into my account, and they're back! The printers are back again. He prints *another* Chrome page, and it works.

Windows can connect to the printer.",23,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF1C1D90>
111,Monochrome is just a state of mind,"This happened today when a call comes in on our emergency weekend support line, and the way ours works is we have a third party answering service that fields the call. Kinda works like this: User calls in -> Call center answers -> call center emails me the details. This is important as I usually get to see the issue before even talking to the user.

Subject line reads ""User can't print in color (good luck with this one)"". Uh oh. When the call center drops the formalities, you're in for a rough time. 

I call the user, and once they answer I start the usual schtick. ""Hello, this is u/nwojdak with [COMPANY NAME] and-"" ""Yeah, I know who this is, you know why you're calling, are you gonna fix the problem or not?"" Pleasant start, I know. ""Sure thing, let me hop onto your computer and see what we can do to get you printing."" While I'm connecting, this user launches into a tirade of ""I've been troubleshooting this for two hours, and I need to print color for a big presentation on Monday, and it's a brand new printer that just got installed on Wednesday so it should be working fine!"" Yelling and screaming with the ferocity of a rabid dog. 

I connect to his computer, check the printer in Printers and Devices, grab the model number, and plug it into Google. First link is for the printer's manual as well as a brief description of the printer. While the manual was loading up, the user was *still* barking at me about how he had read every line in the manual and how there was nothing in there to fix the problem and how I was just wasting his time. Well, the manual finally loads. And there, staring us right in the face, was the line ""Premium monochrome printer"". 

Now, you would think highlighting the word ""monochrome"" would be enough to make the user understand, but no. Because they followed that up with ""That's unacceptable, I need color printing."" ""I understand, unfortunately it is a monochrome printer, so it can only print black and white."" A harsh huff and exhausted sigh comes over the phone. ""I know what monochrome means. *Fix*. *It*. Make it print color."" I pause, not sure how to continue. ""I... I can't. It's a monochrome printer, I can't make it print color, it has no color *in it*. You'll need to talk to your manager to see about replacing it with a color printer, or to see about getting access to another color printer at the office you can print to. If your manager gives us permission to add you to another printer I can-"" Another exasperated, drawn out sigh cuts me off. ""Yeah whatever. Thanks"". The satisfying click of the phone ended the conversation.

After that, I closed the ticket with the simple line ""user was attempting to print a color document to monochrome printer"", updated the print server entry to have B/W at the end of the printer name to avoid other calls about the same issue, and moved onto the next ""emergency"" weekend problem.

TL;DR: User attempts to print a color document to a black and white printer, does not understand why a black and white printer can't print color even when told the printer has no parts to print color.",37,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF1C1DF0>

113,The march of progress,"Seeing a post about Novell NetWare reminded me of something that happened getting on for 20 years ago.

As happens in large companies, they get ""consultants""in.
They decided that our perfectly serviceable, ultra reliable Novell NetWare system needed ""upgrading"" to Windows NT. This was very expensive, involving buying 6 new high end servers to replace the old Novell ones, sending us all on training courses and gradually migrating all the data and systems on to the new servers. Finally it got to the weekend of the Big Changeover where we would actually take the Novell servers offline. We had a representative from every department to check everything was working and hey presto! Jobs a goodun! 
Come Monday morning I'm in early just to be on the safe side. Walk into the office and the phone is ringing.
I answered it to a panicked ""Our systems are completely down! Help! 
So I nipped upstairs to take a look.
This system was unrelated to ours apart from piggy backing on our network. It connected about a dozen terminals to an off-site mainframe they rented time on. One call to the Mainframe company tech support had them as puzzled as us.
It had occurred to me my this time that it was rather a large coincidence that this failure coincided with the switching off of the Novell servers, so I slipped down to the server room and switched one of them back on, let it boot up and went back upstairs. Lo and behold, every thing was working again.
It took us ages to find out why.
About a month later I went in to the server room to find an engineer from the mainframe company doing maintenance on their Comms equipment. I got chatting to him and he told me that this kit was ancient and should have been replaced years ago but nobody wanted to pay for it. Then he said something that my ears prick up. He said that the terminals used IPX/SPX protocol rather than TCP/IP. This is what the old Novell system used. So a bit of digging later led me to discover that IPX/SPX needs a Novell NetWare server to act as a ""session manager"".
The correct solution, of course would have been to upgrade the Comms to TCP/IP but the cheapskate company wouldn't pay, so we just left the server switched on.",14,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF1C1EB0>
114,But I'm closer to the office now!!!,"*Long time ago, in a galaxy far away, I wrote about helping a coworker with a simultaneous printing issue, she is back*


I got a ticket and it didn't make a lot of sense, it was one sentence and it just didn't parse out as a request to me.

> *I have moved and I am having trouble with an app over the internet still.*

I try to call her extension but it just rings until I get her voicemail, so I fire off an email to the submitter, and await the reply.

> My Email: 
>
> Which application are you having trouble with over the internet? What is your connection speed/quality are your new location?

Of course, like the rest of the world, we had a lot of people shift from in office to remote work in 2020. Some of them came back to the office full time, some part time (those guys didn't make sense to me, but I'm a peon), and the mass majority of the company work remotely still. We just happened to have been migrating everything we could to the cloud, because the cloud is the special place that makes the marketing people super giddy when they say it. 

So the majority of our software wasn't 'IN OFFICE' any longer, (I know the term should be On Premise, but it's IN CLOUD or IN OFFICE a lot for some reason) but we have a lot of homebrew apps that are still in the office. Some of the homebrew stuff wasn't designed to work over a internet connection, even a rather fast one. And of course there is no resources to resolve this issue, just keep it working, (*Manager: I don't care if it's not been updated since 2004, keep it working or else.*) I wonder what the 'or else' will mean when it stops working because Internet Exploder disappears completely from the world.

I get a reply to my email...

> Her email: It's ImageTracker, my internet is faster than my old internet and better in every way, it's fiber. 

Ugh...ImageTracker is a document scanning and archive system some programmer made one weekend, and convinced the company to buy from them. It's one of the older homebrew apps, it works, somewhat, on the LAN, but it reads into the local app the entire contents of a folder when you open it. Not a big deal if you open something small, but if you work in a large folder structure, you get timeouts and crashes. It's not recommended to work with across the VPN. We actually have a work around but I cover that later...

> My Reply: Well, connect to me on SupportApp, and I'll see if I can do something.

*Intermission: Since everyone is working from home, we have to help even if we know we can't help. The new boss wants us to put forth a visible effort for the staff, Our Customers, even if all we do is run some command line stuff that looks good.*

I look around he system, I close a bunch of non-work related stuff, check her updates, check to see if she has junkware installed (She does, 4 coupon/deal finders which I didn't think were a thing any longer) and reboot. When the system comes back up I run a speed test, it appears she has an internet connection, but its slow for fiber. Then I run a quality test our ip phone provider has setup.

> Her (chat): Oh ya, my ip phone quality has been horrible too...

> Me (chat): Ya, I called you and all I got was your voicemail.

The quality of her connection is awful (I thought the ratings were Excellent, Good, and Poor...never seen an Awful from it before.) 

> Me (chat): Is anyone else using the connection?

> Her (chat): Why are you asking, what does it matter if someone else is using it?

*alarm bells going off*

> Me (chat): Your internet connection is slower than I expected and the quality is worse than dialup, I've never see the quality test show Awful as a result.

> Her (chat): Well, no one else is using it, I'm not sure why you think you can ask.

*If we reimburse an employee for their internet, that connection is 100% work related during that employees work related hours. If they have kids watching 8k netflix and are having trouble, they are asked to clear up the internet activity, or lose the reimbursement for internet*

> Me (chat): If you get reimbursed for your internet connection from the company, you are required to use that connection for work related traffic during your work hours.

> Her (chat): SINCE WHEN!

> Me (chat): Since always, I need to inform you I'm going to pass this chat log to your manager, you need to review the company policy on working from home. 

> Me (chat): So if you don't have any other internet activity going on, you need to contact your ISP and have them check the connection.

My phone rings, I look at the caller ID and see it's this ladies boss, *le sigh*

> Me (phone): Hello, this is ITGuy

> HerBoss (phone): Why is PrinterLady telling me you are harassing her about her internet activity, what is she doing?

>Her (chat): You still there?

> Me (chat): Yes, your boss called me, one second.

> Her (chat): GOOD

I explain I wasn't harassing or threatening her, I just explained that if she gets reimbursed for her internet from the company, work takes priority during her working hours.

> HerBoss (phone): She knows that, she signed the paperwork when we transitioned. 

> Me (phone): She may of signed it, but she might not have understood it.

> HerBoss (phone): *sigh* Ok, let me know when you get done, send me the long, I'll review it all with her and send her a renewal request for the form. *click*

> Me (chat): You need to contact your internet service provider and put in a trouble ticket, you connection is less than the minimum for remote work and the quality is abysmal. I can't do that for you, and I'm unable to resolve the software issue until your internet connection improves.

She leaves the support session without saying anything else, so I assume she's calling her ISP, or her Boss, or the BetterBusinessBureau (Yes, we had an employee call and report us to the BBB because we asked them to stop their family from using their internet connection excessively during their work hours)

Idle time is the birthplace of curiosity, so I delve into the expense system (I'm the support for the system and I have full access, none of it is PII so it's not technically breaking any rules if I look at her expense forms.)

She has LocalISP internet, but the price she is paying isn't for fiber, it's too low. I google and she's being charge their DSL price, I look at her new address and she's in a new subdivision. I call a friend at LocalISP and he explains that subdivision didn't have any infrastructure when it was laid out for fiber. The best they have is DSL over a POTS system that the developer installed for phone service. I ask it if was possible for someone to have fiber at any address in that subdivision, he says no, and it won't be available soon because of some issues with a developer and builder dispute. He also lets me know the POTS lines were very noisy and it was degrading the DSL service in some cases. Well, that explains her issue...I thank him and offer to get him lunch later in the week, of course he agrees. I then dig a little more, when did she move? Last week, she moved closer to the office to work from home? She's not one of the split time people....weird.

I check my email, and see she's sent me a message...woohoo!

> Her (email): I called my ISP and they checked everything, it's all working like it should, but I still get a timeout with ImageTracker.

I reply to her and her manager.

> Me (email): I contacted the ISP and your new address doesn't have access to fiber, you have a DSL connection and not fiber, your DSL connection is below the performance to meet the work from home requirements. You will need to resolve this issue with your Manager and HR.

A little back and forth for a bit, eventually we end up in a 5 way call with my boss, her boss, her, me and the HR guy. After everything calms down, I explain that the brand spanking new subdivision she moved into has some legal struggles that is preventing any more development until they are resolved. And she is stuck with an outdated POTS system and poor quality DSL service.

After some more hewing and hawing, she gets frustrated and blurts out, ""I sold my house, and bought one closer to work so my work quality situation would improve...""

It was silent for a bit, and I was the first to speak up.

> Me: You moved, sold and bought a new house, so you could work quality would improve? Do you mean moving closer to the office was supposed to make things work better from your closer home?

> Her: Yes, if I'm closing to the office, the internet connection is shorter right?

I had a meeting with HR later for laughing out loud on a conference call...and another after my boss made me explain why moving closer to the office wouldn't improve stuff working over the VPN.",175,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF1C1F10>
115,VOIP vs the entire organisation.,"Hello folks. I posted a little while ago about an SSD that got abused, and realised I had a couple of other good ones in me. Granted, this didn't happen while I was working tech support, but I maintain close relations with the organisation's IT department after being an apprentice there for a few years, I was the office tech support whenever somebody wanted help anyway, and it was interesting to see this one from the users' perspective, because this was a doozy.

Folks, let me tell you about Mitel.

I'm going to keep this all as anonymous as possible, but the important information here is that it's about 2016-17, and that I work for a local authority. From my time in their IT department, I know that our network is a Frankenstein's monster of hardware installed two weeks ago, and stuff put in shortly after the execution of Anne Boleyn. Our offices vary from old enough to have historical value, to buildings under construction. We have windows 8.1 and 10 devices being trialled, rubbing shoulders with the XP machines that we're still finding hooked up in caves, and somebody important has rightly decided to kill the analogue phone network, in favour of VOIP. Naturally though, this is 2016-17, so MS Teams doesn't exist yet, but do you know what does? Skype for business. Lots of people have used Skype, so going to Skype for business would be a logical step.

So the authority bought Mitel.

I spend about a week or so helping the desktop engineers replace the old phones and hook up headsets to the new computers, I help people get Mitel set up, and for about six months or so, everything's fine. To its credit, Mitel's interface was hideous, but at least it was easy to understand and use, and that call quality was good. For six months, everything is hunky dory. Six. Months. Plenty of time for the transition to be completed. It all worked fine.

Until one day, at about half one, it didn't.

That day, the Mitel program wouldn't work for anybody. Main and satellite offices alike experienced this one program just stop working, in the space of about five minutes. IT investigated, but to no avail. But that's just one day. I've seen worse happen in one day. It should be fixed by tomorrow.

Tomorrow rolls around, and it's fixed. Everything's fine. We go about or day, we do our work, we call offices and so on. It's all working fine. Until about half one again. The same flurry of e-mails gets sent to IT, and they say they're working on it. The next day, everything is fine. Until the afternoon. The same thing next day. And the next.

Every single day, without fail, Mitel would stop working across the whole organisation. It's not like IT didn't try to fix it, either; from speaking to friends and colleagues in the department, they tried everything short of blood sacrifices to get Mitel to work, but to no avail. Not even the server team could fathom why Mitel kept breaking every afternoon. One day, I even saw a man from the company that made Mitel walking around, and I don't think I've seen somebody trying to hold it together as hard as that guy. That man was about as popular as a rattlesnake in a crowded, sweaty disco.

This went on for over a year. In that time, the authority installed a whole different system for the customer service phone lines, probably managed to end the contract, and wasted an unknown amount of taxpayers' money on a system with one of the weirdest bugs I've ever seen. Eventually, we went with Skype for business, and today, the infrastructure is better than it's ever been. If anything good came from it, it's that somebody finally learned that buying quality products is better value for money.",45,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF1C1F70>

117,Is the router turned on?,"This happened last year. I do not work Tech support, but I am A+ certified. As the tech guy in the family, I of course get the phone call to come help whenever my parents WiFi breaks. 

My sister is 22 and still lives at home. She calls me one day and says “come help the internet won’t work.” So I go down there. They have more issues than you might think, usually because someone screwed up the router. One time the WiFi radio got turned off with a dedicated button on the housing. Thanks Tenda. 

Anyway my first question on the phone was “is it plugged in?” I was assured by my sister the answer was yes. So I drive down there. Go into the office to look and what do you know, routers unplugged.

118,Why is that spare server blinking?,"I work in industrial automation, and for some smaller customers this bleeds over into also providing light IT support when they don’t have a dedicated IT team. 

A customer was planning on upgrading a few pieces of software on their automation servers and wanted me to be on site in case something went wrong. No problem. The upgrades go pretty well, the server needs a reboot, so I go to reboot it. It doesn’t come back up, so I ask where their server room is.

We walk down the hallway to a door, the customer opens the door, and I’m greeted by a bunch of filing cabinets and cardboard boxes sitting in a small closet-sized room. And then there in the back, around the stack of cardboard boxes, was a server rack with two or three servers humming away. 

I push back the desire to talk about maybe adding some access control or some HVAC to keep the tiny space cool, and push my way to the back of the closet. As the customer is pointing out which servers do what, I ask them which server is the one that we were working on.

The customer points to the floor and there’s two spare servers sitting on the carpet directly on top of one another. But there are wires going to the servers. And the lights are blinking. 

Wait. 

They’re in production this way? Servers just sitting on the floor?

Turns out the top server was their SQL server, and the bottom one that was sitting on the carpet was the SCADA server that I was installing updates on. I don’t know where they got these servers, but they wouldn’t fit in their existing rack so they just kind of… set them down somewhere. 

I gave the bottom server some airflow by putting a cardboard box under it, rebooted it, continued about my upgrades, and finished the day by sending a strongly worded email about how rack mounted servers should probably reside in a rack, and not directly on carpeted floors. 

I’ll give you one guess where those servers are sitting today.",47,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF1C30D0>

I had one user who took forever to respond to my request to install a driver update. He finally did, we decided on a time, and I sent him an invitation so that time would be blocked off.   


A few minutes later, a new ticket comes through the system from this user, with our email thread attached: ""I'd like to confirm this is a legit request."" I replied with details of our appointment and a link to my Intranet profile before closing the case.

120,Why I have trust issues (short),"The first time I ever learned not to trust a user.

I'd been trying to configure their VPN on the machine that I knew for a fact was their home machine. I know this because it's called Home Machine, and is a desktop that never moves and has never moved, because -as I implied- this was their home machine. It also helps that I have intermittently supported this machine over the years.

So I get on there, set it up to connect to their work network, trying to connect, won't work for shit, I spend over an hour getting increasingly frustrated which obviously clouds the mind. Getting this far is admittedly somewhat my fault for assuming anything I'd been told was true, which lead to me not checking/paying attention to certain things.

I call the user up ""Hey, was there anything going on with your internet at yours? I just can't get it to work for some reason, thought maybe you know something I don't.""

""Oh it's (the machine) here with me, I brought it in for you to set the VPN up!""

""Excuse me, you've done what and it's where"" more of a statement than a question

We're 4 miles away from their offices, but I'm surprised they couldn't hear me shouting.",14,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF1C3190>
121,Email > Sales,"First job right out of college was to help one of those big blue and yellow stores get built in the northeast of the US. I was given the hourly wage title of ""Super User"" and wasn't even allowed in to the management meetings that happened once a week. Even though I was responsible for all tech and employee training at the organization.

Found out later it was partly because when managers and assistant managers got bonuses they were a month or two extra of salary and I got $100 in my check.

Anyway, the entire sales floor was thin clients. Half the office PCs were thin clients. Each department on the sales floor had a username and password specifically for that area simply to force printer installs and make sure each department had the software they needed. All managers had a computer or thin client in the office to work, check e-mail, etc.

Well, because managers and assistant managers were so incredibly important they would log in during slow times on the thin clients on the sales floor. Read, print e-mails, the whole nine yards. The problem was when they logged back in to the thin client as the department login and tried to print, that default printer technically ""didnt' exist.""

Now, for these big blue and yellow stores, people have to order mostly in the departments (especially big ass kitchen and storage orders) and then take the sheets to a warehouse to get those boxes stacked up and ready for them.

In some rare cases the network would get so nutty it would bring down all 35+ POS systems at the front of the store.

So - pretty simple solution - right? DON'T CHECK PERSONAL EMAIL ON THE SALES FLOOR. Then we can, you know, sell stuff. And take people's money. And get paid.

&#x200B;

Once a week. Once a fucking week the entire store would shut down and everybody would yell at me even though it was completely and totally their fault. Naturally most of these outages happened during a peak Saturday or Sunday shift.

&#x200B;

Once I put in my two weeks after seven or so months and this happened I'd hide in the server room to let the fire spread a bit before having to restart EVERYTHING. I may be an hourly wage employee but maybe, JUST MAYBE, I know WTF I'm talking about here folks.",23,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF1C31F0>
122,HDM Why?,"On mobile so please bear with me.

 My company has a virtual range. We are upgrading to a slightly more robust system.
For those unaware how a virtual range works is you either have a laser pistol, or a cartridge that loads in a regular pistol that when the trigger is pulled it just pulses a laser. They make them in both red lasers and infrared lasers. A special camera tracks where the laser lands. 
Our current system just used regular paper targets. So it only needed the camera the computer and some form of pistol. The newer system displays moving targets, sudden targets, and a few other scenarios to make it a little bit more engaging and to test other skills. In order to do this it needs a projector.

Today one of our instructors brought over the projector she uses in class to test the system before our projector arrives next week. She had someone vent to her that it is to outdated to hook up to anything. Basically it just has VGA ports. The computer we are hooking up to is aDell inspiron all-in-one with a single HDMI port and several USB ports. There is no VGA on this thing.
No problem, we get a VGA to HDMI adapter at the Walmart around the corner. But for some reason it refuses to recognize this. End up hooking the projector up to a different computer HDMI just to make sure it works and sure enough there's a connection.
Next step is trying to hook the computer up to a TV we have there that we are going to display our training material on. Using a direct HDMI cord that we know works not able to transmit anything to the TV.
Spent another few hours trying to troubleshoot this, to eventually find the information that the HDMI is input only....

Tomorrow I pick up the VGA to USB display adapter.
I probably also need an HDMI to USB because the TV was meant to be hooked up to that same computer..... I have some choice words for Dell right now.",14,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF1C3250>
123,The time we lost a client because they used a printer as their router.,"I still have no fucking idea how this worked because according to our scope we were not to touch the network because “other companies have messed up our network in the past.”

It was a retail shop and we were retrofitting it to work with a new POS vendor. They had all their own equipment but we just needed to wipe the machines load the software, configure RMM for the devices and ensure everything worked. 

When I got on-site everything seemed pretty simple besides a mess of unmanaged switches. All the computers were on dhcp and everything was wired. 

After I set everything up I realized the printers were on a different network. Didn’t seem like a big deal just made sure the PCs had connections to both networks. Scanned the network to see the IP address of the printers and huh that’s strange there’s no gateway for the receipt printers network. After a few more tests yup the printers are statically assigned to a nonexistent network. I asked the owner if I could at least get the printers on the same network …denied.  Ok then.

Low and behold every time X amount of time the printers switched IPs the whole shop went down. No insight into the network so we had to jus to fix it everytime and eventually the customers dropped us for the guy who setup the network.",81,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF1C32B0>
124,Wait... We can do that?,"This started short,  then became longer lol...  If you want the short version,  it's the last few paragraphs. 

Obligatory not officially IT, and obligatory not as impressive as some,  just a fun story.

I work in an (officially) non-technical role on a decidedly non-technical team,  other than that we all work from home so have mastered turning it off and back on again.   

The tech portion for my peers is generally limited to pulling reports into Excel from our ""business intelligence"" system,  and attempting to track issues (to keep it vague,  our team processes dozens of ""files"" a day which were set up by another team,  and often not set up properly)   

This is the ""Excel pivot tables are miraculous!"" level of tech knowledge.  (If anyone happens to recognize this...  I love you guys and totally get a kick out of your excitement about pivot tables.) 

I have been the unofficial go-to tech person since I came on the team, 
 since machines make a heck of a lot more sense than people.  

That being said, I'm a baby at programming and data analysis.  Well, maybe a toddler - I can write a mean Excel vba script (with the help of stack overflow of course!) ... Attempted to learn SQL a while back but never ended up needing it. And I have a half finished mod of Dink Smallwood from years ago  (dating myself now!  Lol)  

We had the basic reports to run in the BI system, but no one on the team knew how to change the queries or change what it generated,  so any new reports were done by a different team w significant delays.   

But, surprisingly the user interface is semi-logical. Using my vague memories of trying to learn SQL and lots of trial and error, I started making my own reports, and some for my boss as needed. 

That was several months ago. 

Apparently my boss is still getting used to being able to have new data at their fingertips on the fly...

Recently, they approached me and asked if I could make a list of all the files that we had a specific issue with,  along with pulling a reference number from the file for another system. 

This is a significant amt of time to do manually.

Knowing that this info is documented clearly in a queryable field - my response was...  ""How about I make you a report instead?""

""Wait... we can do that?""

Why yes.  Yes we can.

125,"Dude, Where's My Server?","I have never had the pleasure of working with Novell.  The first server I managed was a 2003 SBS.  However, the company I'm with now had managed a handful of Novell servers and there's an interesting story with one.

We had managed a Novell 4 server for a small doctor's office for several years, and at some point stopped managing their network, handing ""the keys"" over to either a new company or to the office, I'm not sure which.  In any case, we get a call about 2 years later asking if we could assist in locating their server as the office is in the process of migrating to an NT domain, but the new provider cannot locate their server.  Technician who had handled that client previously goes onsite and notices that the building had been renovated.  He states ""the server used to live somewhere around here,"" and the unmistakable whir of server fans was just barely audible.  Using his ears as a guide, the technician walks all around the area and cannot locate the server.  After several minutes, he decides to look in the most obscure place possible and retrieves a ladder and a flashlight.  Upon the removal of a ceiling tile,  the fan whir becomes much more prevalent and a ""hole"" is discovered in the ceiling tiles, a small 4x4 foot opening on the other side of the wall which has no ceiling grid over top.  A faint green glow can be seen emanating out of that hole.  The server is located on a tile floor surrounded by 4 walls, still dutifully serving up the shared drive.

Apparently, during the renovation, the office was still operating.  There was originally a network closet to be placed in that location, but was moved to another location in the building.  The server became enclosed with no door.  As I understand it, the server could still be there, powered off.  Following the migration, the server was shut down and never retrieved.",104,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF1C3370>

127,Highest-Paying Job of My Career,"A buddy and I were reminiscing and I recalled this story I thought you might enjoy. Probably not unique in the slightest, but satisfying in its own way. Characters and dates have been changed for obvious reasons; names and flavors have been changed because I'm not sharing with anyone.

----

If you travel the wrong way for about 22 miles from where I used to live you end up in a mostly-irredeemable, one-gas-station-town that sits on a fork in the road. This town has given itself the tagline of ""Gateway to the [redacted]"" and is full of about 12-too-many souvenir and kitch shops. The overloaded SUVs trying to park without lines or make u-turns on a two-lane blacktop make it one of the more dangerous stretches of state route and guarantee that just about no one has any reasonable need to stop there.

However, if you head behind the abandoned auto shop, in just a few turns through some single-wide scenery you arrive at a ramshackle house-turned-restaurant that can only exist in areas of extreme zoning apathy. There are clear signs of at least two additions, yet the building still seems small with only a half-dozen four-tops and four barstools. This establishment serves typical greasy spoon diner food of above-average quality, but the item that keeps a radio cruiser and a small fleet of motorcycles in their parking lot is their taste-that-can-only-come-without-a-nutrition-label, snozzberry pie.

On overcast evenings, sunny afternoons, after bad days that need redeeming, on great days that need celebrating, or weekdays ending in ""y"", I made a habit of making the drive for the questionable entree of my choice and a fresh slice of snozzberry pie *a la mode*. There are very few things I miss about many of the places I have lived, but this pie is definitely one of them.

This particular late Sunday morning, there was a hastily written sign taped on the door that warned in bold sharpie ""cash only"". I was prepared, so I entered undeterred.

> **$Greeter**: Good morning, welcome to **$Place**. Our card machine is down, so you'll have to pay in cash, is that alright?

> **Me**: So your sign says--that's fine. The bar or a corner is fine; I'm probably going to overstay my welcome.

> **$Greeter**: Well, it seems you're the first person to read it. Just over here...

...and I tucked into an oversized chicken-fried steak.

In between indignant customer complaints--""what do you mean you can't take credit!""--and exasperated apologies--""our card machine is down, but there is an ATM at the gas station just down the street"" I heard a statement we have all probably heard before with a cringe:

> **$Cook**: I've unplugged the Internet three times already, that's not the problem!

I initially kept my head down as normal, but the abuse the kind-hearted staff was getting started to nag at me, so I crept out on a limb while ordering my desert:

> **Me**: Can I get a slice of snozzberry with vanilla ice cream for dessert, please? Also, I don't mean to intrude, but I work in IT and I'd be happy to take a look at your card reader problem if you want--no pressure, I can pay either way.

> **$Server**: Oh! That would be great. Let me get your order in and I'll check with **$Cook**.

A few minutes later I was in a room we're all familiar with: boxes of tax receipts, an open electrical box, and a nameless modem and net-link combo router on a wire shelf. Somehow, nothing in the room is upright.

It took 15 seconds to recognize the lack of lights on the router, and trace the plugged-in cable from the device to the unplugged wall-wart behind one of those banker boxes. A few minutes later the lights turn a happy green and a quick test of the card reader produces agreeable results. I humbly extracted myself before the jumping-up-and-down **$Server** got a bit too familiar for my liking, and returned to a warm slice of pie with a scoop of just-melted-enough ice cream dripping down the edges. I was equally happy to save some fellow support agents from some undeserved hostility and mute the complaining customers for the remainder of my stay, but mostly I was happy about my pie.

I paid with cash and tried to slip out unnoticed, but I was stopped at the door by **$Server**--she thanked me and handed me two slices of snozzberry in a box with ""Thank You!"" penned in gold ink that was somehow dotted with a heart. It was the best payment I'd received in my career and remains so to this day. The drive to that diner takes about 2,500 additional miles today, round-trip, but I still catch myself considering turning North instead of heading home some days.

I ate both slices before midnight that day.

I regret nothing.",92,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF1C3430>
128,Electricity and internet - cause and effect,"Long time lurker, few-time commenter, first time poster. I have withheld some stories so long, that I'm afraid must start posting them before i forget them. Also regular mobile user warning. This tale is more about embedded IoT system rather than PCs.

This story came from relative who works as freelance electrical engineer. Tale happened about month or two ago, but details are bit fuzzy. Few years ago he worked with a small power grid maintenance company to help them upgrade some control system you'd find in electrical substation. I don't know what that system did, but one feature added by upgrade was to enable easier remote control and monitoring by adding internet connectivity via 4G modem.

Fast forward to January when he got rather distressed call from owner of maintenance company. Turned out all upgraded substations had gone offline, apparently causing blackout affecting hundreds of people and company's sole employee (owner) was on vacation at other side of country (I said it was small company). He needed relative to go and assist grid company with fixing the substations, because he was one who set up those comtrollers.

Turned out end users weren't experiencing any issues at all, most of substation's systems worked fine as well. Only exception was the IoT module, which refused to connect to the server. Quick investigation showed that modems' SIMs had hit data cap, refusing to connect internet. 

Issue happened simultaneously with multiple cards, because they were all managed under same package and contributed to same limit. Root cause of the problem was misuse of one of those SIM-cards, which had ended up in owner's laptop's modem. Remember how he was on vacation in remote place? Well, he had habit of keeping eye on home's IP-cameras while away, but laptop on which he watched them was using SIM-card linked to IoT plan, eating up all data plan.

PS. Bit context of company relations for clarification - electicity distribution network (grid) belongs to state-owned monopoly, which subcontracts infrastructure construction and maintenance to smaller firms. This particular maintenance company had just one full-time employee, but due to size of the upgrade project needed additional support.",7,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF1C3490>
129,I still don't know what was wrong with that keyboard,"I worked a summer position for a team of desktop techs at a university a couple years ago.  I was there only for a few months and I can recall way more tales than I expected. So I cannot imagine the amount of stories some of you may have! Anyways, off to the story:

I am sitting in my workspace deep in the underground lair and notice a ticket in my queue for a broken keyboard. Dr. Joe (not real name) is stating that certain keys are not responding and not clicking right. At the time, we have been deploying new machines that came with a different keyboard than the norm. Essentially, the standard keyboard at this university was changing and Desktop did not have extras of the new keyboard. I was informed  by the team to not provide older model keyboards to users with newer machines. Fair enough, I get the reasoning behind it. So, I decide to drag myself over to Joe's office to take a look and possibly troubleshoot his keyboard. 

First step I did was open a new word document and just test the keyboard out by typing random sentences coming to my mind.  Keyboard worked fine! But Joe refused to accept this ""No way it was not working with me at all"" he said. 

So I told him ,""Let me do some more troubleshooting"" then proceeded to restart the device and re-plug the keyboard to another USB port. Once the machine was back up and running, I opened a word document and went off typing random sentences yet again. Well look at that, keyboard is still working perfectly fine. 

I tell Joe something along the lines of "" you may have just been experiencing a one-off kind of issue, your keyboard seems ok to me"". He somehow still refused that the keyboard was fine and asked me to type what he says. I proceed to type and I sat there for a good minute or two of dictation till he finally decides to take the hot seat himself. Joe types a few words himself and is now convinced the keyboard is fine but still seems iffy about it. Me being as ""customer service oriented"" as possible I tell Joe that I will check with the team if there is anything else that can be done.

I ask a member of the team and they tell me to fix my headache by just giving Joe an older model keyboard from the stack we have in the back of the office. I sigh, take the keyboard, head over to Joe and give him a new keyboard.  Joe is happy, I am happy I am finally done with this ticket and I guess everybody wins? 

TL;DR: Ticket for broken keyboard came in. Keyboard was perfectly fine but user refused to accept this. After proving to the user that the keyboard is ok multiple times, I still had to give him a replacement.",19,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF1C34F0>
130,Are you sure you looked EVERYwhere?,"I've been an IT support manager at a state agency for quite a few years, and I have accumulated a ton of IT horror stories. When you combine government workers and technology, the tales can border on legendary. On this occasion, however, technology was merely the setting.

We were converting from our original ""username/password"" method of logging in to the network to a two factor authentication system.  For those who don't know what this is, you still use a username and a password to log in, but now you also have a keyfob that gives you a six digit number that you also have to enter into the login screen.  The number on the fob we were using at the time automatically changed every sixty seconds.  Each user had their own fob: the number on your fob wouldn't work with anyone else's username and password but yours.  It was a giant leap in network security.

The weakness in this system was our users.  Now, I work with many wonderful people who I respect and who are hard workers.  Don't get me wrong, these people are very good at what they do and we're lucky to have them, but just as in any office there are a few... special... people.  These are the ones that make you seriously wonder how they find their way to the office in the morning without getting hurt.  These people can make a simple project rollout challenging, because we have to take them into consideration whenever we write instructions or documentation.  These are the ones who may seriously ask you where the ""Any"" key is.

In preparation for the two factor system rollout we had to not only issue the keyfobs to every user but we also had to provide them with foolproof instructions on how to use said fobs.  We wrote and rewrote the documentation, got it worded as perfectly as possible in order to both be informative and appease anal rententive upper management.  The final product was a thing of Frankenstein-like beauty: a single page of grade-school like instructions including a picture of the login screen with an arrow pointing to where the six digit code should be entered, a picture of the actual fob, a red arrow pointing to the window on the fob where the six digit number would be found  (yes, really)  and instructions to call our help desk with any problems or questions.  Manila envelopes were prepared for everyone: the envelope had the name of the employee, an instruction sheet, and that employee's assigned fob.  The envelopes were sealed and placed in each employee's chair, and each chair was placed facing the aisle.  It was a foolproof masterpiece.

Enter the fools.

There were the usual questions... ""Do I Have To Use This To Log In?'... ""Is This Fob Mine Or My Neighbor's?""... and the ever popular ""What's This For?"".  The tech support calls were even better.  Out of 150+ users, we only had two who complained that their fob's code wasn't working.  One was asked to read out the code she was using and said ""LOE115"" at which point we had to tell her that she was holding the plainly printed fob upside down.  One person, however, complained that she had gotten no fob at all.

My techs scrambled - we were sure no one had been left out!  A token was assigned to her account in the system but she said she didn't get one, so - we quickly assigned and synced up a new fob, grabbed an envelope and the instructions and quickly dispatched it to the user.  When my tech got there, the user wheeled around, said ""Oh, thank you!"" and stood... revealing the envelope we had left the night before in her chair.  

She had been sitting on it.     ",40,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF1C3550>
131,The network system MUST be changed!,"When I joined the shipping company they were running Novell Netware 3.12 on the two servers they had in two of the UK offices. A couple of years later HQ decided the system needed upgrading. They sent out CDs for Netware 4.11 and gave a short training session on how to upgrade/use it etc.

It was great. I had the two offices running 4.11 and set up the other two offices with the 3.12 version. Things were ticking along nicely. An update here and there were easily accomplished with minimum fuss. Everyone was happy.

Then HQ announced we were all going to get fax from the desktop software for all of us. Everything was going to be managed by this program. Our outgoing fax machine usage would drop as the program would automatically retransmit and let us know if there were any failures.

Only caveat was that all the network servers had to be changed from Novell Netware and installed with Windows NT Server in order for this to work properly. I protested. Regional IT in Hamburg protested that there must be another way to implement this. HQ was adamant. The entire domain structure had to be moved to Windows NT immediately. After much despair, wailing and gnashing of teeth it was accomplished and we were all running on a Windows NT domain.

The fax software arrived from HQ. Upon inspection I discovered the program just needed to be installed and running on an NT server. Any NT server that happened to be plugged into the local network, Netware or Windows, and made accessible to the users.

Privately I think MS products were very easy to ""acquire cheaply, nudge, nudge, wink, wink"" that brought about this system change. Don't get me started on the package of 25 3.5"" floppy disks of Microsoft Office (Korean version) that arrived riddled with malware and viruses when I scanned them.",12,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF1C35B0>
132,Accidentally Locking Yourself Out From The BIOS,"I work at in the IT department for a government organization in Canada. Ever since COVID lockdowns started the department has had an IT Kiosk set up for employees to come back to the campus and receive support at a central location. I have helped a lot of people with a lot of things that ultimately don’t deserve any kind of story here, but today I finally had a client to give me a good tale.

The first client I saw this morning was an older guy who submitted a service request about not being able to login to his account. This is fairly common. With the way our secure networks operates sometimes clients who change their user password remotely over the VPN lock themselves out of their account until they come back in to the office and connect via ethernet.  So I look at this ticket and think “oh ya this won’t be a problem.”

The guy comes in and I turn on his laptop and before the laptop even posts to the Dell logo a screen comes up demanding the Administrator Password before we can access the OS. I had never seen this before and my gut reaction was it was a Bitlocker issue, but it looked entirely different. I ask the client if this was new and he said that it was the reason he came in. So not exactly what the ticket says, but no big deal yet. I ask him to sit tight and bring his laptop to the admin at the Kiosk and he has no idea what the problem is, so he tells me to ask our Team Lead. I ask the Team Lead and he also has no clue, so he tells me to ask the guy in the backroom since he handles all the imaging and may have seen this before. I go to the guy in the backroom and he also had never seen this before. There is a new guy working and he says he has seen this before and it is a BIOS password. I am dumbfounded thinking that the client had opened the BIOS to change his account password, which is just not the way to do it. So I go back to the client and before I can say anything he says there was something he did not tell me.

The client explains that after he changed his user password there was a program he was trying to use that he was not able to login to. He thought it was because he changed his user password. Of course it doesn’t work that way but sometimes clients just have limited knowledge of how these things work. I ask him to use his new password on this screen and it doesn’t work. I ask him exactly how this happened and he says that he was just trying to follow an email he was sent to get his bitlocker code. We straight up do not give those codes out. They allow the unlocking of drives so it is pretty important for a government organization that we keep that stuff under lock and key. I ask him why he was looking for his bitlocker code and he said he wasn’t sure. I was getting confused at this point and asked what the email was for. He said it was for getting the bitlocker code. I tried to clarify and asked what the purpose of the email was for, as in why did he need the bitlocker code? He said he didn’t know why. I was getting even more confused. I asked where the email was from and he said he wasn’t sure, it was something that was sent to him two years ago. I let him know that the bitlocker codes are pretty important and we don’t have any way for clients to get their own, and he just shrugged his shoulders and said that he was just following the email. I asked him if he has the bitlocker code and he had it written down, I double checked with the code in the Active Directory and, not surprisingly, it was not correct. He said that it may be the code for his personal laptop. He said he followed the email until it asked him to go into the BIOS which at that point he said he “chickened out.” He definitely did go into the BIOS and either did not know what he was doing or was lying to me.

In hindsight I should’ve asked him to forward that email to me, but at the time I was just confused and swapped his laptop for a new one. He is costing the government a new motherboard because of some random two year old email that he followed without knowing why he was doing any of it.",27,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF1C3610>
133,Passwords are hard,"In my job role I need to assist employees logging into two separate apps.

Generally I provide an email and text message to new users with links to access them, some light instructions, and the actual login information.

Our younger tech savvy users have no problem. Logged in quickly without more instruction. The majority of our users need hand holding. Usually in person, but that isn't always possible.  


Recently I had a new issue that was just... it was just.  
I'm trying to help a user log in. I've provided him his credentials, I've tested them myself, but he simply cannot get it to work. He thinks it is due to his device. I know that it is because of his fingers.  
I am trying to get him to include the capital letters. He doesn't know what that means.

Capital letter... upper case letter? BIG letter? I'm at a total loss in describing to him how to capitalize a letter. I struggle my way through that. As many passwords go ours requires a special character. Our default includes an \[ ! \]. He doesn't know what an exclamation mark is. I send screenshots of how to access it. How to type it in. Nothing.

&#x200B;

That one totally stumped me. Had to send someone out on a special trip to help him input his credentials correctly. This happens ALL the time.",72,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF1C3670>
134,I am not able to open the file,"A little back story that I am working at a private BPO IT service desk voice account. The time this story happened I was a noob in the industry and was not very good at my job. On that account we have an app (not sure if unique to the client) where we can remote in to any computer and if the computer is company provided we have admin access but if personal or other company computer either view only or very limited access and at that time I was not familiar with RDP or MSRA.

This is a short story about my struggle on a call when I was a noob. The caller was a nice old man using his personal computer for work and the issue was that the file from our citrix site was not opening in the workspace app, it was opening in Internet Explorer and keeps asking to redownload the file over and over again when opened.

So I asked if he already installed the app citrix receiver(at the time) from the citrix site, he said yes but not sure if correct. I asked to check in the system tray if he can see the citrix logo there was little but surprised the app is installed and correct version but still not opening in receiver app.

I tried for a long time trying to connect to the computer to manually assist in correcting the file association since for non-technical people is somewhat difficult to follow with just dictated instructions. We tried multiple times for me to remote in using the app and site but seem either their firewall or their ISP is blocking the app for me to remote in, so I proceeded with blindly troubleshooting and instructed user step by step in correcting the default app in opening the cirtix file.

And his computer made it more difficult cause the receiver didn't appear in the list of apps in the small open with window, had to walk him through the manual process of file association by selecting the .exe file from the installation folder,  thankfully after selecting the correct exe file was no other issue and we were able to resolve the issue and ticket.",5,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF1C36D0>
135,I'm in the hospital and the doctor is asking for help,"So I was working at an ISP back in the 90's. Once morning, on my way to work, I got a pain in my side that was so bad that I had to pull over to the side of the road. I was out of my car rolling around on the ground due to the pain.  
The pain let up somewhat so I drove to the hospital.  
It was early morning so there wasn't any patients in emergency so I was taken directly in.  
The doctor listened to my description. Then he poked my abdomen and I hit the ceiling in pain. He asked if that hurt and I said F\_\_\_ing yeah.  
So he said you have a gallstone. Then he said that he would get me a shot for the pain.  
He stayed by my bed as we waited for the shot to arrive. As we waited he made small talk and he asked what I did for a living.  
I told him I worked for an ISP taking care of the servers.  
He then asked if I could look at his printer as it wasn't printing correctly.",227,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF1C3730>
136,Madness incoming,"LTL, FTP, Mobile, English as third language...You know the drill...

Not exactly TS, but freelancing in IT. Sorry, if it gets long, but am cutting short as much as I can. I live in a country, where English isnt the first language, as well, as the client, although they speak another language there. Got contacted, as a huge part of their clients speak the language spoken here and the language spoken, where the client is located, is my second language. They want a mostly automated system, where their clients can input data directly, with which they need to work there. All good so long. The product then need to process these into files to import into a Software they need to use by local mandation. All good so long.

After a long, difficult talk with that Software company, I finally, after several wrong ones, get the documentation for the import function. Bad part: the data, that can be imported, only covers 1/3 of the functions, the client needs. The rest is needed to create files to send to official entities. No documentation found for those.

After analyzing these files, I get mostly around the structure, but got some questions. Next problem: client contacts today, that he forgot to mention, that the codes for the same thing differ from one entity to another (total of 3 entities). He also sends me the IDs of their clients, but without names or codes. All codes he sends related to the clients are with their names, but without ID. You get where this is going?

Finished analyzing without questions the files, but now need to match all the codes and insert them into the DB. 200x2 codes client related and 10k+x3 entity related. Wish me fun. Ah, and deadline is in 2 weeks.

Edit 1: Out of the 200 clients, 16 got submitted with codes as names. And not any of the already used codes.

Edit 2: It gets worse: 1/3 of the clients hasnt names in one of the entities, but yet another code.",8,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF1C3790>
137,A funny story from my last job,"A few months ago, I was working at a client facing helpdesk for an ISP. It wasn't a very difficult job on the technical side, but it was a good first job for me to get my foot in the door in an internal IT department. Anyway, it was my last week at said helpdesk job. I was about to go home for the day and I get a call from a restaurant owner, annoying but sometimes it comes with the territory. He is not a happy camper.  

I answer the phone with the usual greeting  ""thank you for calling <ISP> my name is ___ how can I get the name and address of the site you're calling in reference to?"" Guy starts screaming, yelling, and swearing that his internet isn't working. (you know the type) I respond saying I'm sorry the internet is not working and I understand how essential it is and ask if his modem has power. 

Restaurant owner responds with ""are you kidding me?? How could my modem have power? My fucking electricity is out?"" At this point I am facepalming at my desk as I explain to him that he needs to call his electric company and figure out how to get his power back on and that modems need electricity in order to provide internet service.

138,Signal loss? What's that?,"Way back in 2008 I was working in the warranty dept of a telecom OEM.  We primarily made video on demand and cable internet equipment, that was used by a LOT of different companies on the head-end.

I was the only tech worldwide for a wireless data network product.  Outdoor units were 25 mile line of sight, 5 mile non-line of sight, 300 clients per base station...  indoor units were about 100 yards line of sight.  The non-line of sight range is the issue with this customer.

I've got my usual flow of units coming through, and my boss comes out of the office to tell me we have a major problem with this customer.  Apparently all his units were dropping signal strength and were ""barely usable"", had a shipment coming in a couple days and to make this my priority.

Get in **3** pallet boxes...  those big 4x4x3 things...  stuffed with indoor units.  Close to 300 units, so 1 base station.

Was about 30 into the first box, all RMA'd as ""low power"", all NFF on my test equipment.

Tested 10 out of the 2nd box...  all NFF.

Tested 10 more in the 3rd box...  all NFF.

So that's 50 of 300, ""low power"" that all test fine on the test rack and FTP setup 50' away (heavily attenuated).  $68 a pop for NFF, so I've already done $3400 worth of testing by noon.

Walked over to engineering, got a figure of ""1.6-2dBm per wall, 6 for concrete""...  my boss contacted the customer to give them an update, and asked if they wanted us to continue testing.  Engineering said a 10dBm loss across a building was a reasonable expectation.  We shipped the customer all 3 pallet boxes back that afternoon.  Customer paid shipping both ways and the bill for my morning of testing.  Company wouldn't have noticed the shipping cost, but it was a customer issue not a product issue.

Saw 5 more RMA's from the customer over the next year, 3 base stations that needed refreshing and 2 indoor units that needed power amps replaced.  Guess they learned their expensive lesson.",30,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF1C3850>

I called him and instead of trying to explain what he had to do and losing 30 minutes of valuable time, I decided to do the change myself (2 minutes of work). I asked for his Teamviewer ID and password so I could have a look. He asked where he could find this because he didn't seem to find it. I explained it as simple as I could where to find it. His reponse was that his screen was black because his computer actually was turned off. His next remark was: ""So my computer has to be enabled in order for you to make the change?""

140,Grab that printer port!,"Back in the days I was a network supervisor for the UK offices a South Korean shipping company (now since gone bankrupt). The head office decided it was time to move the company onto a modern network capable version of the COBOL/mainframe batch system they used for shipping related documentation.

It was to be a all singing dancing system that installed updates to the user PCs as they started up the software each day. As software loaded it would check a location to see if any new updates were available. It would then download/install these updates before starting.

This system was meant to be fully network aware so you could sign into the program from any office and print invoices/reports/bills of lading/etc to your local office printers. Various printers were assigned to print queues dedicated to each print function with the correct paper installed.

Imagine our surprise when we went to print one function, can't remember what it was after this long, and the system gave an error about the printer not being available. Print queue is there. Printer is ready and online. Why can't we print?

After some investigation we find out the developer for that particular function back in South Korea tested their software output by printing to the printer plugged into his local printer port (think it was LPT1) on his PC. Everything worked so he HARD CODED the software to only print to that printer port !

Too much trouble to rewrite the software. So from now on we had to run a batch command on each PC starting up to capture LPT1 and assign it to the print queue for that function so the printer could receive the output as intended. So there we had fully network capable system that would only print to a printer connected to your PC!",8,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF1C3910>
141,A small story from my last job,"Prior to my current position, I worked at an MSP. One of the companies we supported used some credit card processing software that would occasionally experience an issue: It couldn't work due to a port not being available.  


Now, we had a documented fix that was fairly quick and simple to implement, so downtime for that issue was fairly low. It was frustrating for both our client and their customers while it was happening, though, and it was only a band-aid fix. We were fairly busy when I first started, so didn't really have time to try and solve the root problem.  


Then Covid hit. We lost some clients (but not the one in question), and most of our clients let some employees go, so we had less tickets. That also meant we had more time, so when this happened again and it was already a slow day, I got to investigating and called the company that made the CC processing software.  


Turns out, they had hard-coded a port number into their software. That port number was in the 49152 to 65535 range. When I realized this, I facepalmed a little. There was the root cause of the problem, and why it was as intermittent as it was. So, I found a way to prevent Windows Server from handing that port out, ran it by our resident Server Bro, and then implemented it.  


As far as I know, the company didn't experience that problem ever again.",54,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF1C3970>

143,Updates?? Unacceptable!!,"During my time at an MSP supporting MANY different medical offices, I've had my fair share of phone calls with practice admins and the docs themselves. There was one doctor I was on a first name basis with, because I helped him figure out what was wrong with a piece of medical information software they were using. He wasn't a techy, but he understood the basics because he took the time to listen to me and ask good questions. Whenever he would call in, it would literally make my day.

Unfortunately, not all doctors are like that.

There was one office in particular who I was pretty familiar with, so much so that the practice admin (PA) was emailing me before she emailed our helpdesk to ask if a certain problem was handled by us (every time I told her to email our helpdesk first, it would end in ""But you're the best! You know us so well!"" responses). Anyway, one day she called in about one of the doctor's computers being crazy slow. I asked if I could remote in to it, and sure enough, the computer was a snail. It would take a full 30 seconds to register a mouse click; really, really bad.

Obviously the Dr. was furious, saying how we just did a refresh of his desktop (which we did) and now it's broken (it wasn't) and all that good stuff about how IT never does the job right.

*During this refresh we suggested that the computer have an SSD installed instead of an HDD, but since it was ""more expensive"" the Dr. insisted on the HDD. It's cheaper and had more storage. Despite the fact that he only ever used 30% of the space on it. But no, he knows what he wants, we're just the desk jocks who have literally dedicated our lives to this field so we can't possibly know more than him.*

So I opened up task manager and saw that the hard drive was running at 100% and wasn't slowing down. Boom. There's the problem. Except of course that I had no idea what was causing it.

I emailed our dedicated field engineer about it and he suggested that it might be downloading a major Windows update, you know one of the big ""feature updates"" that have a new Windows version number and all that, and it made sense because Microsoft had just released a major update to Windows in the past week. So I got back on the phone with the PA and let her know to just leave the computer plugged in and it will eventually speed up again after the download.

*Also as a side note, we are constantly asking our clients to run Windows updates at the end of the day, so that the computers do their thing overnight and when they come in the next morning they just have to restart and we won't have to deal with a landslide of problems. But of course, that's too much work, and when it all inevitably breaks all fingers point to IT.*

After a few minutes I heard the Dr. in the background screaming again about how ""it still isn't fixed"" and the PA asked if I could explain to him what I had just told her. So I did. Of course he wants to know how long it will take, and I regrettably had to tell him ""maybe an hour from start to finish, it's a big update."" He wasn't a happy camper. But instead of yelling at me, he turns on the poor PA, shouting about how ""this is her fault"" because ""you're supposed to run the office smoothly, that includes my computer!"" After a long-winded minute he left again to go see patients. I couldn't do anything but apologize to the PA and insist that it wasn't her fault.

A few weeks later, a call from the same office. This time it's the Dr. on the phone. He's complaining about how his internet is slow. I hop on his computer again and my connection is a little choppy, so I check his computer's uptime and sure enough it's been on for a full 2 weeks. I suggested that he should restart his computer to, ya know, install the updates that downloaded 2 weeks ago. Apparently that was too complicated for him, and I had to guide him on how to restart from Windows instead of ""pulling the cable out of the back of the 'router.'""

So not only did this Dr. cut power to his computer whenever he wanted to turn it off, but in his own mind he thought he knew enough about them to start gunslinging jargon at me. Needless to say, I ended the call soon after this, and subtly suggested to have the PA call me if there's any further issues ""so that I don't take up your precious time.""",69,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF1C3A30>
144,"""No, you don't need Admin permissions for that""","In my company, we have a team that IT and Systems hate. They're so entitled, all MBAs from top universities who look to the rest of the office as beneath them. 

They have the best cutting edge hardware that any pro-gamer would be envious of, and they still complain that the machines are too slow (hint: might have something to do with the 20 Excel files you have open on top of the Bloomberg app, plus the crappy macros you wrote that have no memory management. What's that? You don't know what memory management is? You don't say...). 

They always want any new software they can get their hands on (which needs to be approved by the larger company we belong to, and go through the proper on-boarding security process), even though they barely know how to use it, because someone read that it might do something they could use at some point, and they want it yesterday.

We have company-wide security policies that apply to everyone, yet they have to have exemptions because ""they cannot do their work like this"", and upper management lets them get away with it because they make the company a lot of money, although luckily Business Daddy is zeroing down on that and slowly kicking them off of their golden pedestal.

In any case, for a reason that doesn't deserve explaining, they're moving databases, so they needed a sandbox place where to do their development. When I set them up in a test server I manage personally, I told them that security policies dictated by higher powers explicitly state that I was not to give them admin rights to their database, and that there was no possible reason why the would need it. My bosses would've just given up and let them run wild on the server, but I am more stubborn and headstrong, much to their chagrin. I just gave them all the read/write/ddl permissions, so they can do and undo anything they want within their own pigsty without it contaminating the other databases we have there.

Fast forward a couple of months, and after a few bumps, they're now wanting to move the tables from their old database to the new one on the sandbox.

(Side note: for some contract reasons, we cannot just take a backup of the old one and load it into the new server, so it really has to be a table-by-table transfer)

The problem is that once they move their tables, they need to add Primary Keys to them, and for that ""they now need admin rights"". My bullshit meter starts beeping.

I go back on their email and remind them that we cannot give them admin rights (I want to add ""especially for such a ridiculous reason"", but I save it for myself), and that any script they need to run that requires higher permissions, they can send it to me and I'll review it and run it. They don't like that.

There's a back and forth on the emails, ""Yes"", ""No"", ""YES"", ""Nah"", ""YES!!"", ""nuh-uh"", but we have our weekly meeting scheduled for that day, so anything they want to tell me, they can say it to my virtual face.

Along comes the meeting, and they start by saying it's non-negotiable, they need the rights because it's a lot of tables they need to migrate and they're too busy and don't have the time to go through each table with me, and they rather do it themselves.

I'm confused, because they will need to script every table as a CREATE command, so why not include they keys then and there? But, apparently someone else will automate that scripting, so they don't need to worry about that. Besides, they're too busy to go through the automation process and change the script to include the keys.

I still don't understand their logic, or how they'll be automating the scripting, but I still won't give them the permissions. Any key they want to include after the tables are built can be sent over to me and I'll run the script.

But no, they don't have the time to go through every table with me, they're too busy to schedule a meeting and sit down with me to get the keys added. I'm doubly confused now. Who's talking about a meeting? Just send the code you need to run.

Well, unstoppable force meets unmovable object and they just get frustrated. They literally say: ""let's move on, because we're getting nowhere with this, and I don't plan to discuss this for 40 minutes while we get nothing done"".

My blood boils, and I just say ""Fine, I just don't understand why you cannot script whatever you need to change and send it to me. You say you're too busy to go through every single table, but you'd still need to know which columns need to be set to a primary key for each table. If you don't know that, I don't see how you'll be able to add them, admin rights or not"".

It's worth pointing out that my boss and boss's boss have been quiet all this time, and it's just me and them bashing it out. Well, after my snarky reply, my boss jumps in and tries to defuse the situation: ""Ok, maybe if we set up another meeting you can explain us what you're trying to accomplish, and we'll see how we can help you"".

The main guy is already sharing his screen and shows us in the object explorer in SSMS: expand ""Databases"", expand [database_name], expand ""Tables"", expand [table_name], right-click ""Keys"", click on ""New Foreign Key"", warning message pops out saying they need permissions to do that action.

""We need to go through hundreds of tables and do this. You want to volunteer your time just because you don't want to give us admin rights? Fine. Go ahead"".

Well, TFTS, here's where my jaw drops. Mister better-than-you top University MBA genius that is ""too busy to go through every single one of the tables"" with me is actually planning on going through each and every single one of his database tables, expand, right-click and add a Primary Key in the most inefficient way possible.

I'm just bewildered and simply say ""You do know that what you've just done can be scripted, right?""

""What....?""

""That whole action of selecting a table, adding a column to be a primary key... all of that can be scripted"". I just type the command in the meeting chat:

ALTER TABLE [table_name] ADD CONSTRAINT [key_name] PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED ([column_name])

Suddenly, his angry tone shifts in a second faster than a bi-polar Karen off her meds.

""Oh... ok. Fine, let's do it like that"".

I was reminded of a similar story that happened with me.

Many years ago (around 1995 I think), I purchased a color laser printer. It was super expensive at the time, since they'd just come on the market. I set it up and people were happy. The guys in the art department discovered the new printer and rather than use their nice (but slow) dye-sublimation printer, they started using the color laser.  Fast forward a few weeks and I see the duo (lets call them Dim and Dimmer) down the hallway hanging around the printer with the cover up. I was super busy and figured that they had a paper jam and kept right on moving on.

Later in the day I get a call that the new color laser wasn't working right. I walk in to see that Dim and Dimmer had attempted to refill toner on the printer, but got it everywhere in the printer. EVERYWHERE. I looked at the print out and rather be the clean, beautiful print it had been, it looked like there were lines going down the page, smudged colors, just awful looking.

I cleaned it as best I could, but the drum had been damaged by toner getting everywhere. I called out warranty support, but they washed their hands on the issue, since proper maintenance hadn't been followed.

When a meeting was held (since I had to purchase \*another\* printer), I was stunned when Dim and Dimmer said that since I'd seen them, I knew what they were doing and had given approval to what they did. That got shot down really quickly when I explained what had really happened. 

Eventually, I got approval to do the purchase (that wasn't in budget). When the new printer was brought in, signs were put around it, ""Service by approved personnel only"".",95,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF1C3AF0>

Well normally it would be time to send an intern, but it's Saturday so there are no interns. I grab a fresh toner cartridge and carry it up with me. There's a guy dressed in his Saturday best, athletic shorts stars and stripes walmart-chic shirt.

I put on gloves, i'm already wearing an n-95 mask so that's not a worry and tear the old cartridge out and start dusting the machine with a dry brush while I wait for facilities maintenance to come up. They show up and see the mess and give me a ""What the F dude"" look.

""wasn't me.. i'm not the one covered in toner powder"" he rolls his eyes and nods. Being a cool guy he vaccums up the inside of the copier first so I can get the new cartridge in. Not having anything better to do I help the guy clean up the rest of the mess. Because that's what I want to be doing is cleaning toner on a saturday.

I wrap the empty, and the half full broken cartridge up and in a trash bag to carry them down, I walk out into the hall and run into the guy who started this whole mess.

147,A tale from my previous employer,"I happened to bump into a friend from the old days yesterday.  I worked (and he still works) in a British Government Ministerial building - and he told me a tale of full lockdown back in 2020.

They had a major shutdown - nothing directly IT related but an electrical fault that took away all power from the building.  Theoretically when people aren't in is a good time for such a thing to happen as the servers moved to immediately backed up servers elsewhere (if you work there, part of the plan is backups in case London is nuked!  Decent backups).  But there were interuptions to homeworkers working for about 20 minutes, which also meant that they couldn't log into the IT Helpdesk to find out what is happening here .  \[There is an option to log on via Leeds servers and, outside the IT department, only 5 out of 480 staff thought to do that.  Only 2/3 of IT thought of it either but that's another story\]

One of the few systems that fell over what fell down was the IT call forwarding to helpdesk mobiles.  Again, Government - the phone company doesn't control call forwarding - we do (now anyway - can't remember what the answer was when I was there.) - but with the power out in the building, they can't do that this end right now.  Still, plans in place for that - the helpdesk at our HQ in Leeds can do that.  Except...  Lockdown.  There are obviously some people working but - London and Leeds teams don't really need to talk much outside specific projects (and there was no-one in working on those at that time).  No-one knew who was in and therefore who to call.  So it's the general number.  ""You are 83rd in the queue"" - what?!?  As both call forwarding to mobile *and* the London helpdesk were down, all calls from the hundreds of homeworkers were going to Leeds helpdesk stopping London talking to Leeds...

There was a local IT Team in the other London building - but no-one working there that day (Lockdown again) with access to that specific system.

In our wonderful age of technology, the problem was solved by one bloke having to take a cab across London to re-route the phones and to message all users just to log back on.  We designed for nuclear strike, we just never considered Covid and a power outage...",31,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF1C3BB0>
148,Busted laptop screen,"I was in IT for 47 years and had my own shop for 23 of it. During that time I witnessed many (mostly) strange and wonderful things, this is just one such occurrence.

I had a healthcare client for several years that primarily did her PC work from home and she had a son who was about 8 when we started out. Every time I was there to fix something he was a little shadow wanting to know what I was doing, etc. If mom didn’t mind paying me for the extra time that I was taking to answer his questions, it wasn’t a bother to me. She said that he was interested in computers. OK, cool. I can be a mentor.

Over time whenever he’d see me he’d pump me for info about this system or that one and games. He’d do this when I doing work for his mom or since he was now older he’d stop into my shop every once in a while. One day mom, the kid with a bandage on his head and a laptop came into the shop. I asked what was going on, mom looked at the kid and said you tell him. The kid slowly started out that there’s a problem with the laptop screen. I said ok, let’s take a look. I open it up, hearing the plastics crack and creak and in the middle is a large depression, with little bits of plastic sticking out. The kid said that he was playing a game, was stuck on a level, got pissed off, picked up the laptop and bashed the front and top of his head with it several times. This resulted in several stitches having to be applied, hence the reason for the bandage around his head.

He had not only did in the screen, but the base and lid plastics where the hinges attached. After attaching what was left of the laptop to an external monitor and saw that it was still functioning, I gave mom my diagnosis. Yes it still works, but the cost of the screen, plastics and labor might outweigh the cost of a new laptop. 

By this time she was really ticked off. I found out that the kid has ADHD and was going to the alternative school. The majority of their school material was online and that was his laptop for school work. I told her that we have a work around for home, but not at school.

This was around the time that the LCD from CRT technology was going on. Having been a long time customer, I told her that if she had the space, I’d let her use one of the old CRT’s I had for free and that we could get him going for school at home. We went to her house, she cleaned up a spot at the dining room table where the kid usually sat and said set it up here. I guess the kid was going to be eating somewhere else for a while.

About two weeks later she had me over to move his documents and programs, less the games, to the new laptop.",7,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF1C3C10>
149,Why wildcard DNS causes more harm than good…,"A relatively slow day in support, a customer had called up with a recurring issue where when connecting to the company VPN, their mapped drives had not connected and they were told the device was in use. I work in a MSP dealing with many different configurations that have their own little quirks, and this is one of the many.

This was my first case of dealing with this specific issue, however it turned out this issue had existed for nearly 2 months. Only slightly shocked by this, I did some basic troubleshooting. 

The server could be connected to through File Explorer by hostname and IP, and pinging it returned the internal address. Everything looked fine, however I felt that it must have been an issue with DNS (because it’s always DNS) and flushed the resolver cache. I tried pinging by hostname again and ended up pinging a VPS (virtual private server) off in the countryside of England. I couldn’t understand what was going on, and given that we didn’t have much filling up our board, I decided to give the user back their computer (with the drives temporarily working again) and investigate further on our side.

I setup a version of their VPN on my test environment, and got the exact same issue. Why was this randomly resolving to something outside of the domain? Tried pinging other subdomains and they were all resolving properly, and nothing looked out of place. In my frustration of not understanding the problem, I made a typo and instead of www, I had started a ping for wow.client.tld and whodda thunk it, it resolved the VPS. Turns out when the hosting provider for their website configured it, they decided that there would be nothing wrong with putting a wildcard A record in so that any subdomain would resolve to the website. How naive they were.

So, disconnected the VPN, typed in the FQDN (fully-qualified domain name) for the server, lo and behold, the rogue VPS. After numerous calls and 3 companies pointing the finger at each other, the hosting company admitted the mistake and there’s shiny new www and @ records taking the place of the monolithic problem causer that had shadowed us for months.

In fairness, this issue should’ve been looked into deeper after the 2nd or 3rd occurrence, but when you’re strapped for time on the first line of support, the quick fix feels like the best to keep a client happy. To counter that, never use wildcard DNS records, they cause too much pain down the line for the initial setup. (If you do have any proper reason for having a wildcard DNS record in production, you have my interest and time.)

TL;DR: Drives didn’t like speaking to us because we were firing the requests to a completely different location on connection.",28,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF1C3C70>
150,Woman doesn't understand the Difference between IT and App Development,"I had studied for a few semesters for a Bachelor of Computer Science, but when Corona hit, I dropped out and started doing a Traineeship for a company, as an App Developer.

I was working for the Company for 4 months now, freshly out of my probation which ended about a week ago. The App team of RnD has a big office with multiple workstations and the office of the RnD Head is right next door. I was the only one in that day, the rest having vacation or working from home, including the Head, happily working on my project when the office phone rings. 

I look at the number and see that it is from another office phone from this location(the company operates worldwide and I am in our HQ in Germany). I of course pick up since I am the only one present.

""RnD App Team, OP am Apparat!"" (Translation: ""Op speaking"")   
""My Laptop isn't working!""

I am confused for a moment since this was a german facility, but chalk it up to one of our non-german employees being here for some reason. And them calling me instead of IT was probably just a mix-up.

""I'm sorry, this is RnD, not IT. I can give you the number if you want.""   
""I know, no one is picking up there.""  
""Have you tried going there? It is in the basement of the main building.""  
""No, I have better things to do. You are working with computers as well, fix it.""  
""I am sorry, I am only a trainee, there is no one else in the office right now.""  
""So?""  
""I do not have the authority and probably not the knowledge to fix your Laptop.""

After I finish there is a short pause and then the line is cut. I don't think anything about it and go back to work. 5 minutes later a woman comes into the office and slams a Laptop on my desk in front of me. Demanding I fix it, I reiterate that I don't really have permission to do anything, but can take a very rough look if she wants, but nothing more than she has permission to do really.

She grumbles and logs in, immediately I notice that she has around 70 Chrome Tabs open on this Laptop. I tell her that is most likely the problem if her computer is just running slowly. Her response is that it is never a problem in her office. I tell her that that is all I can do. A bit of back and forth, that comes down to her not knowing the difference between IT and RnD and she gets up and tells me that my manager will hear about this.

I shrug because I know there is nothing that she can do to me. I can't get fired for not doing a job that isn't mine, and my probation period is over. As she leaves she immediately turns and barges into the office of the Head of RnD, who is working from Home. She stands still for a moment before glaring at me and telling me ""Your manager will hear of this and he will take action against you!"" Which in itself is funny, because the RnD head is a woman.

Once she is gone I inform my trainee supervisor of what just happened, he tells me I did everything right and can't face consequences. A day later the head tells me I handled the situation perfectly, my supervisor had informed her about 15 min before a mail from the woman came demanding I was punished. 

How can people not understand the difference between IT and App Development?",135,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF1C3CD0>
151,Calculator problem,"Not in tech support. I am just a 17 year old boy but I think this goes here. 

I was in the examination hall giving a small physics test. We are allowed calculators for examinations and those are EXPENSIVE. It is a Casio fx-CG50 and costs 11000 rupees(150 $) 
Since I am good at physics I was done fairly quickly and handed my answer sheet to the teacher. While walking back my friend in the front asked me to borrow my calculator. I asked him what happenned and he showed me his calculator. Apparently he was calculating square root of some number and it was giving him answer in square roots. He said there is some setting problem and asked me for my Calc again. There was a button on the Calc that allowed to change any square root and fractions to decimals. I pressed it and returned his calculator. Mind you, we have been using this calculator for 2 years and this button was also mentioned in the guide. He never even read that and threw it away(considering these are expensive anyone would look it up how to use it such that you don't mess something up). I promptly give him his Calc and he thanks me for saving his paper. The twist here is that there were no square root calculations involved in the entire paper. I quietly told him that his answer is wrong and walked away surprised.
I scored a full in the test.",60,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF1C3D30>
152,Tales of woe from an old IT Support guy.,"Just joined this thread and as a 68yr Old who has spent most of his life in IT from Support to management I have accrued a few stories. It was suggested I post a few here.

This is part of a story I posted in r/facepalm:

About 20 years ago I was the IT manager for a large London trading bank. The Traders (About 100 of them) were not known for being a calm and collected bunch and one year a trader was so pissed off that he did not get the yearly bonus he wanted / expected, he threw one of the old 14"" CRT monitors through the 2nd floor window of the bank which crashed to the pavement below!!! 

He could so easily have killed someone below, but as luck and timing would have it, no one got hurt. Well He was frog marched off the premises and that was the last I thought anyone would see of him, but lo and behold, the next day he was back at his desk, and the bank had given him the bonus he wanted. I soon came to realize that the traders made so much money for the bank that they were really the one's running the show. The traders ran the bank.

During my 9 years there, I lost count of how many times a trader said he would have me sacked because I did not attend to HIS IT problem above everyone else.

I quickly learnt it was all bluff and posturing, and I grew a thick skin pretty quick. You had to in order to survive in such a high pressure environment where any Trader's system could cost the bank millions if it went down mid-trade or market collapse etc.

Anyway. Just one of many incidents, but probably the most dramatic. Others were of a more humorous nature.",91,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF1C3D90>
153,"When I use zoom, other end user cannot hear or see me but I can hear and see them.","In my organization, I support all communication application tools and among other things. You have to understand one thing about me. If it doesn’t fall under my support group. I am not doing it! Cause you aren’t paying me to do anything else outside my job role. Unless, you’re extremely nice, then maybe I’ll go out of my way for you. Today we’re going to talk about Zoom.

Anyways, the user stated that she had talked to three other reps today and they could not figure out what the issue was. (That’s got to be rough considering it takes an hour just to get through to my support line. So if you had to be transfer, you're already a couple hours into the call. So at this point she already annoyed but understandable. I got her to calm down a bit and told her I’ll do what I can and let’s focus on the issue at hand). So I get the IP address and remote into her laptop. 

Right when I got into her laptop I notice something odd. The mouse pointer was annoyingly shaking. So I inquire with the user what that was about. She said she doesn’t know but it seems that whenever one of our agent’s remote to her laptop it just shakes like that. Whatever, not my issue right now. Clue #1

Let me check out the Skype setting just to make sure your speakers and microphone is working properly. Hmm, that’s strange. Your Skype is saying your speakers and microphone cannot be found. Clue #2

Let’s go see what going on with the sound setting in the control panel. Hmm that’s odd, your microphone not listed here. Also, your speaker say “remote speaker.” Clue #3

At this point, I am stump. Unsure, why the speaker is saying “remote speaker” and why the microphone is missing. So I started to ask general questions. 

Did you update your Laptop recently? – No.

When was the last time this all worked properly? – Before I started working remotely. It work just fine at the office. I only have this issue when I work remotely.

Do you use a VDI (virtual desktop interface) – I don’t know what that is. (I glance over at her profile. Nothing showing that she uses a VDI) 

I use a docking station, could that be causing the issue? She said. 

No, but let’s go ahead and remove it from the docking station and let see what happen. (Nothing changed when the laptop was removed from the docking station.)

Eventually, she kept saying something about “I logged into my desktop” several time throughout our conversation. Clue # 4. 

At first, I’m like, what is she talking about? Everyone needed to log into their desktop to work. Why does she keep saying she “log into her desktop?”

Then it hit me, I think she is using another type of VDI that is not log into her profile. I spent about 10 minutes trying very hard to explain to her what a VDI is. The whole time, she kept denying that she is not logged into a VDI.

After some back and forth, I finally got to her. I was able to get the IP address and remoted into her laptop. Turns out she was using an application called “Remote Desktop” and that was why she kept saying “I logged into my desktop.” To be fair, I did not know team members were still using these application considering we have better tech.  Explain to her slowly, in great details that she cannot make Zoom or Skype calls inside the VDI because it will not capture her microphone. If there was a way to fix this. It’s still out of my support group. Hardware and application can handle this. 

Then she asked why the other agent couldn’t figure this out. I told her it’s because most likely no one really knew you were using a VDI. Had I not press for more info from you. I would assume it would be a hardware issue.

As I was ready to let the user go, I just have to know. Why are you logging into the remote desktop application? She went on a very long story about how she’s been here for so long and she’s been logging into the remote desktop and had store data file in that environment and need to get to them. Even then, it makes no sense why she still need to log into the remote desktop while she was at the office. so she is either restricted to store file on her local drive or she just making her job harder than it needed to be. As far as I know. A restriction did not exist. Whatever, not my place to tell peoples how to do their job.",46,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF1C3DF0>
154,"I did literally nothing but yeah sure I guess I ""fixed"" it","Thursday afternoon I got a message from $client:

""We have daily email reports for XYZ delivered every morning at 9am through your software, we haven't received any reports for over a week, this is very urgent, look into it immediately and let us know what's wrong.""

Doesn't look very urgent if it took $client a week to notice the lack of emails. I know that they are not very tech savvy and they share their administrator account & password with their entire team, so my first guess is some other person deleted the emails or moved it to another folder. But the email subscription system is very important, we have reports going directly to their CEO and VPs, so I drop everything to look into this issue.

I pull up the subscription logs. First thing I notice: no errors at all for the past week, everything has been running beautifully. Second thing I notice... uh oh... XYZ subscription ran for the last time on Feb 1st, then nothing. Did someone delete it? Nope, I check the folder and it's there, I test it and it works fine. I can't reproduce the error. This subscription system of ours is very good at what it does but documented poorly, so it's hard to troubleshoot and I might need to escalate this to the dev team. I start worrying about how many reports we might have that are not being correctly delivered right now. 

Then finally, far too late, it occurs to me to check when this subscription was last updated and... surprise! It was updated Thursday morning around 11am. Way after the time it should have ran this morning. New hypothesis: someone at client's company messed with the settings on Feb 1st, possibly set the report to deliver Never instead of Daily; then this morning someone reverted the changes, either the same person or someone else, I neither know nor care; unfortunately today was also the day $client remembered about their precious reports, so they sent me on this wild goose chase without knowing that the problem has already been fixed.

Unfortunately, changes to the subscriptions aren't logged, and the users share their passwords merrily all around, so good luck holding anyone accountable for their fuckery. Last time I told $client that their Very Important Document had been deleted by their own account, they got snippy and said that was impossible because they were in a meeting all day. So the email I send is just:

""Hello $client, subscription should be fine now. Let me know if you receive the report tomorrow at 9am.""

And, as expected, the response:

""Great job, thank you for being so quick, it works now.""

Sure thing. I did literally nothing for two hours but you're still getting billed for that time, so in the end everyone is happy.

155,Unintended Consequences!,"This happened back in the eighties when PCs were in their infancy and Windows were things you looked out of. I was working in a kind of ""special projects"" department, we were pretty autonomous and people from other parts of the organisation would come to us with stuff they wanted done. Around this time, we got our first PC. I was given the task of looking after this, and quickly applied myself to learning about it. I had already had some experience on a PDP11 so it wasn't completely alien. I gradually taught myself programming (albeit only BASIC) but it wasn't that different from FORTRAN that I had taught myself on the PDP11.
After 6 months or so I was able to write useful code which streamlined some of our data processing tasks including taking live data streams and processing them on the fly to get real time statistics.
Around this time my boss brought in a guy from another department with a job. He had to do lots of data processing by manually trawling through miles of printout looking for anomalies. It was very time consuming and complex work and he was wondering if it could be ""computerised"". I like a challenge, so I agreed to do a feasibility study. When I dived into it, I discovered it wasn't so complex and was able to successfully modify one of my existing programs to do the job. The stats he wanted were available in minutes rather than hours. Everybody happy, you would have thought. Well, everybody except the guy who originally asked for the project, I found out a couple of months later that the data processing was his entire job, so after I ""computerised"" it for him, he literally had nothing to do, so they made him redundant!",29,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF1C3EB0>

157,"Everything was working perfectly, but this was easily my favorite service call.","Edit: Now with tldr at the end!

I'm a residential security system installer, but my boss calls me a ""tech"", so hopefully that's close enough to share a tale that maybe you real techs can emphasize with. Cause some weird stuff happens down here, and I've got some stories I've been telling the rookies for years.

My most memorable service call happened probably ten years ago, right around when I finally went from understanding enough to do the job to really getting a good understanding of how it all really worked. There's not really a lot of knowledge required in this field, you gotta know standard stuff, where you can and can't put things, specific laws and stuff, but you don't really have to know too much of why. The equipment is cheap enough that it's not worth the time to really get deep into the why. If it doesn't work, move it or replace it. So it can take some time to start really understanding how it works.

So I get a call about one of my recent installs. I put a lot of effort into doing things right because if I don't, I'm still the one who has to go back and fix it, and that sucks to do. So my natural bias is that the customer wasn't paying attention to the instructions and hit a wrong button. But false alarms really piss the local police off, so when you get a call, you go soon.

This particular customer had a glass break detector in the master bedroom go off, not every night, but a lot of the times right as they go to bed. It's important to know what's happening when it happens so I can determine if it's a faulty system, or if it's being triggered somehow accidentally. The detector detects sound, some particular wavelengths that the most common types of window glass gives off when broken. But it errs on the side of caution, so loud, sharp noises within short distances can trigger it. So you start at the usual suspects. We're you watching a loud action movie? Slam a door? Drop something heavy or made of glass? None of those. I remember a few years ago a small dog in a small room going ballistic set one off, but this one was in a larger carpeted room. But I was out of ideas so I asked them, do you guys have a small yippy dog? The husband grinned and the wife looked away.

They didn't say at first what the nights it did go off had in common. When they asked why about the dog, I went into explaining the thing about loud, sharp noises. Turns out, she was that loud sharp noise. Knowing this, and that it's not faulty, I turned down the sensitivity a bit and they never had another problem. And I'd be mad too if my alarm system continually went off everytime things got good.

Tldr: young couple's nighttime activities were exciting enough to fool the alarm system, and now they got a great story for the kids.",38,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF1C3F70>
158,My job as a help desk ticket descrambler,"I work  L2 desktop support in the public sector. My team often gets confusing tickets from our service desk.

I asked the person who took the call for more information and context, alongside what troubleshooting was done. They stated the user just got an error, the call agent took a screenshot, and kicked the ticket our way. I asked what troubleshooting they advised before send the ticket over, but all I got was a ""we are busy and we don't have the time!"". I know that trying to get more information was a fool's errand, so I call the user on the ticket.

159,Working between the lights,"Thanks to u/yoloJMIA for jogging my memory about Hard Drive issues from the before times.

Worked at a Travel Admin Office around 2011\\2012, where you could partner your private travel agency with our company and we would help with the backend bookings and stuff. Part of my job was to help ITC's (Independent Travel Consultants) setup their new machines to work with our systems.

One of these ITC's was really nice and asked a lot of questions about the which machine to buy that would work well with our systems. Eventually she bought a Dell machine which ran beautifully for months, no issues at all.

One day she came into my office and asked me to check why her machine wont start. Plug it in press the button, no bootable disk found. Check the bios and it picks up the drive as there but wont boot. Explain to her that her OS may be shot and I will need to try and do a recovery on it. Not happy as a lot of client data is on there but at least we have yesterdays backup to pull from.

No matter what I try I cannot get this thing to work, recovery errors, failure to install, wont work in other machines. Drive is now a paper weight. Phone dell support to get it replaced under warranty and they arrive next day with a new drive Windows 7 ready to go take the old drive back for testing. Reconfigure the machine, reload the backup data and the user is ready to go.

About a month later, same story, drive just will not work, phone Dell and they log a tech to come deliver a drive next day. User is not happy as we advised her to get this machine, I'm not happy because this has never happened before and I now look like an idiot.

Machine fixed (again), and the user goes back to work. about a week later I'm talking to her about something unrelated and she tells me she's going to dinner with a client so she is rushed but she can maybe squeeze some work in between now and dinner. I ask wouldn't she be late if she heads home first because of traffic and she casually tells me ""No, I'm heading straight there, I'll just work between at the red lights, it's what I normally do anyways"".

So basically she would have the machine open on the front seat next to her running the entire time while driving home and then when the light is red she would do some work. The poor drive was spinning the entire time and obviously getting bounced around the whole time. 

I told her about that and explained how a drive works and she was completely embarrassed about the whole thing but was a lot happier now that she wasn't under threat of loosing her work again.",8,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF1C4070>
160,Help! My screen has gone completely blue!!!,"The first ticket of the morning comes from one of the higher-ups. It's marked as urgent and comes with no additional information. I'm currently in the middle of swapping out all our old tower desktops with micro-formfactor PCs, and I know this user's PC is older than most, so my first thought is a BSoD or something along those lines.

Then the phone starts ringing. it's the user in question:

#User: ""My screen has gone blue and I can't get any work done!""

#Me: ""I know I just saw your ticket. What exactly does it say on the screen? Is there a QR code displayed?""

#User: ""Can you please just come up and fix it? I can't get anything done like this.""

If it were any other user, I wouldn't put up with the lack of info and panicked messages, but keeping any higher-up happy nets IT more money in the long run. And besides, they did say please.

So I head up to their desk. It's a small company and it's less than two minutes walk away up a flight of stairs. I get there, and the user is frantically typing away staring at their screen.

#User: ""Gimmie two seconds to send this email and it's all yours.""

Okay. Not BSoD then.

User finishes typing and hops out of their chair. 

#User: ""Do whatever you need to do, I've left it unlocked. I'll just go grab a coffee!""

User skips off and I walk around their desk to look at this ""blue screen"". Of the two monitors on their desk, the one on the right has a slight blue hue and a mild flicker. I check the cable at the back of the monitor, follow it down to the incredibly dusty tower on the floor and find the VGA cable slightly loose, not screwed in. I push it in, screw it, and the blue screen disappears. I make a mental note to put the user in for a PC swap and head back downstairs.

By the time I get back to my desk I have an email from the user:

#User: ""I don't know what you did but thank you so much!!""

161,Help when I log in I get this screen I haven't seen before,"So I work at a software company and this morning I'm alerted to an emergency case which isnt abnormal since alot of our customers are pretty dumb and break our software or have a production down issue because our software is overly complicated. 


The ticket I get says "" I logged into the server and it came up with this screen I've never seen before and I don't know what to do."" I look at the screen shot and it's a standard you have to be authorized to logon to this server click okay to confirm your authorized  message that anyone that's worked for a large corporation has probably seen when logging into a Windows machine.  What makes this doubly stupid is we don't manage the servers for these clients they own them and they have there own outside IT to manage them and they know this. I tell her what it is and close the ticket.  I'm so glad we bill hourly clients for this stuff.",11,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF1C4130>
162,"""Give the user full admin permissions""","While working for a MSP one of our clients installed a new accounting suit onto their servers that required a specific path a permission set for the application to work from the users machine. Initial testing worked well and the head of finance could work without issues so we decided to roll out the software to the rest of the team. The vendor created the accounts and did a basic connection test to see if the application was loading which it did.

Next day I'm handed a ticket stating that they can connect to the system but they cant pull reports. Check all the settings the vendor sent us and they all match, compare it to the managers permissions that we know is working and they all match. Cool, must be a vendor side issue so I'll send a email to their support and get them to just have a look.

Nope, nothing wrong with the software, must be a local server issue. Hasn't even looked at the issue on the server just outright tells me their software is working correctly. 

Could it be a bad permission or incorrect grouping or something like that (We all miss these things from time to time)?

Nope, Software is working fine, Give the user more permissions on the server.

This went back and forth for like 3 days (Managed to get a work around by giving the some users a RDP connection to the server so they can work from the actual server on the support account \*cringe\*) before I lost all patience and told them I would fix their software as they don't seem to be able to.

Borrowed the Managers login details as he had some backend access I couldn't get with the support account and started digging. Found a section where they had created a group for access to the reports that should have been linked to the initial group created for the users but had basically been left floating on the back end doing nothing. Manager wasn't even aware that this was a thing they could do as the vendor told them to call them whenever a new user needed access. Linked the groups and everything started working like it was meant to.

The vendor then tried to get our access banned from ""Their server"" cause we are fiddling with ""Vendor Only"" settings. The CEO of our client company ripped into them, threatening them with a suit for breach of contract.

Some times I love my job....

TLDR: Vendor forgot to give permissions to software and tried to make us the bad guys when we fixed their mistake.",116,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF1C4190>
163,Zoom Call Settings. User Error.,"I'm a lone tech support person for a small university program. Lecturer had a guest speaker joining through zoom and I wouldn't be around to help since it was later in the evening. I came in beforehand to personally load the presentation files, test a call, and test all of our av equipment. Sent a message to the lecturer

Me: ""everything is set. You just need to start the call, don't change any settings""

Lecturer: ""great, thank you so much!""

Received frantic texts from my boss that evening while I was at home. ""Audio isn't working! We can't hear the guest with our sound system and he can't hear us!""

Came in this morning to an angry boss. Red faced and raising her voice at me. Literal tantrum level meltdown. 

Boss: ""why wasn't anything working last night? This is unacceptable for our instructors!!""

Me: ""I can't say why until I take a look at it. I tested it last night just beforehand and everything was working/properly configured. There's no reason I can think of unless the settings were somehow changed in the zoom call.""

Boss: ""(literally in hysterics at this point.) don't make excuses for the equipment! It's not the lecturer's fault that nothing around here is working!""

I went to look at it. The zoom call from the previous night was still open. Lecturer had changed all of the audio and camera settings, and hadn't even joined audio for the call. 

Boss did not apologize or even express an ounce of remorse for their tone.

And that is why I am planning to leave this job.",37,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF1C41F0>
164,Too many ions!,"This just happened today and I think I’m still trying to process it.  I had a user whose laptop was frozen and I had to have her do a forced shutdown by holding the power button.  Once it restarted and everything looked fine the following conversation ensued.
    
>Me: It seems to be OK now, in general it’s a good idea to restart your computer at least once a week, daily would be better but once a week is the minimum I’d recommend.    
>User: Oh right, because of the ions.    
>Me: Excuse me?    
>User: My husband works in IT so I know all about the ions.

>User: While a computer is on it builds up ions.    
>Me: …     
>User: If it has too many ions things stop working properly.    
>Me: …    
>User: So you need to restart to clear out all the ions from the computer.    
>Me: … Uh, yeah, so make sure you restart every once in a while, OK?    
    
I still don’t know if her husband actually told her that just to get her to restart regularly or if he was explaining something else and she just completely misunderstood what he was trying to tell her.  The latter wouldn’t surprise me, I’ve seen people’s eyes glaze over as soon as I get even slightly technical when talking about their computer.  Even people I would ordinarily consider to be very smart.

165,POS support issues,"Over the past 50 years, I have spent the last 30 doing tech support/testing/planning for various point of sale systems (yes, POS cover's it nicely).

Anyway about 15 years ago, the primary vender changed from one large IT company to another.  Since I was the one in control of the baseline (software and hardware), everything that was a proposed change came through me before going to the field.

Went on leave (one week, away from the office but still available online and working).

When I got back, thought that everything was going well - no problems reported while I was out, which should have been a good thing.

Had a meeting with the prime contractor the next week and one of the bullet points in their presentation was they had installed software at all of the POS locations while I was out.  I didn't authorize it and no one (supposedly) knew anything about it.

The software had to do with how to handle credit card transactions when the store would lose their internet connection.  They would store the transaction, with an encrypted card number and encrypted security code.  Then process the transaction when the connection came back up.

Interesting, that concept had been around for a while and was not supposed to be implemented without a lot of testing.  As you may imagine, a lot of impacts depending on how long the network outage lasted.

Anyway, started testing this in the lab and found that it didn't work.  When the card number was decrypted to be processed, it was all zeros (0) in the middle eight numbers of the card.  Same for the security code - all zeros.  So the transaction would fail.

This had been installed at all of the remote sites then a major internet outage occurred - lasted about 2 days.  All of the credit card transactions were processed in this mode.

The retailer lost millions in transactions (for this retailer, the average transaction was better than $600).

Now the fun begins.  The contractor has no fall back position, and no way to recover the data.

It fell to me to figure out a method of recovering the transactions - yes - there is a way to recover them.  It took about 5 days of working with the data to get to that point.  No, I will not disclose how it was done, so don't ask.

It took over two (02) months to get approval from senior management to recover a sample set of these transactions.  By this time, many of the patrons had already spent the ""excess"" funds elsewhere.  So, they screamed.

Upper management reacted and shutdown the entire recovery process (even though from a technical standpoint it worked!).

In the mean time, the contractor fixed their code.  It was tested and found to work correctly.  Then implemented in the field.

No one could believe that I had methodology to reconstruct the card numbers and security codes.  The contractor was praised for their good work at making the fix, but not chastised for bypassing the testing on the initial install.  The senior management person that authorized the initial install was praised.

I was ... left out in the cold.",29,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF1C42B0>
166,It finally happened today - I always thought you guys were joking about how dumb people can be," 

Just had my first ever, 100% true ID10T error call at work-  
Had someone email me asking for me to call them when I could. I phoned her and she asked if I had a replacement mouse I could give her. I asked what was happening to her current one to see if we can troubleshoot it first before total replacement ( usually just a dead battery on wireless mouses ). 

  
""Oh, nothing is wrong with it. Someone used it while I was gone, and with Covid going around I was afraid it would be contaminated"".

  
I let her know that we are currently in short supply of mice, and to sanitize it with copious amounts of Lysol and Lysol wipes as a solution.

167,Saying you “messed up” isn’t hard to admit.,"I work as a SD analyst in a hospital but we’re located 5 min further at an admin building. 

So I get this doctor on the phone who has issues logging into Citrix secure hub on the phone, I sent him the guide that we provide our users that includes trouble free step by step pictures. Step one was entering the organization’s URL, the Dr tells me it doesn’t work. I decided to tell him by letters on how to enter it, he proceeds to get frustrated and tell me that the issue is with the app. I proceed to troubleshoot by asking to re-install, update, etc etc casual analysis, he insisted that he did all that already and won’t do it again. I tell him okay then since I can’t find the issue please come visit us at our office down the road when you’re free, he shockingly agrees! 

Half an hour passes he visits me at the office and hands me his phone all angry and pissed. So I grab it and the first thing I did was enter the link and guess what?? Wow it worked! I tried to be all cool about it and continued to sign him in, one I finished he wanted to launch one of the applications and sign in first because he insisted this one “won’t work” for sure. He signs in with his domain credentials and it didn’t work, he shoved his phone in my face and gave me sorta of an “I told you”, I asked him kindly re-enter again as the phone might of had an issue entering it, he proceeds and wow what you know, it worked! He’s all embarrassed and starts being all nice and kept on thanking me for being patient, I just wish the same could of been said since this was an issue that could of been solved over the phone and within 5 minutes.

It can be hell sometimes but sometimes I gotta admit it does make you feel just a tad better when you show them how simple they’re issues are when the choose to be impatient.

168,A story of how my greatest accomplishment has flown completely under the radar,"Buckle up.  This is a long one. 

Background.   I served in the military for 13 years as a legal specialist and court reporter.  All of my IT experience is just me figuring it out using Google and guessing.   Got out and immediately was hired for an IT job that they rewrote a little so I could also do cool court reporter stuff with some AI and fancy audio equipment.  I’ve been doing that for 3 years as of last month.  

This story isn’t about the court stuff.  That’s going swimmingly.   FYA, there is some nifty speech to text stuff out there.  But I digress…

We’ll start a few years before I got out.   I was working in a place with a civilian IT guy.   He was supposed to have a supervisor, but that position had been vacant for years.    It was a four-person department and he was flying solo.   He quit and I ended up taking over what was explained to me as his daily job. Basic helpdesk stuff.   Mapping profiles, network permissions, group email account management, phone transfers, etc.   very small potatoes.    Again, no new hires and I did this by myself for an office of about 60 for two years.     

I got out and was asked if I wanted to come back as the new civilian IT guy.   The pay was good and I didn’t have to move and already knew the staff and assets so I accepted.  They also finally hired the supervisors position, a guy with a lot of management experience.  

About six months after we started, we got a call from the Enterprise-level guys.  They were informing us that they were shutting down a system we were supposed to be managing because it hadn’t been authorized or recertified IN 7 YEARS!!!!   

It was an aging Lotus Domino Server, around 23 databases, each with tens of thousands of records that oh, by the way, are mandated by congress to keep for 10 years.  It was a home brew setup, no support or maintenance except for what the every-three-year rotating people had googled enough to fix some issue.   So many busted agents and looping actions    An email Notification system rigged to a commercial Email re-router that no one had the login credentials for.   The admin in the ACL were long since retired and here I was with zero clue except someone once said “he is good at computer stuff.”    Luckily, my supervisor knew exactly what was wrong and how to submit the paperwork to fix it.    And he thought it would be a good idea to have me do it so I could learn.     Great idea.  

So I slowly got a package together, submitted it, and it failed.  Immediately.  Expired this.  Outdated that.  Tons of security flaws in the web interface.  

Ended up teaching myself what a salted hash was, deleting all 3000 users passwords and creating a temp login reset so anytime someone logged in with a black password field, they had to set a new password.    

First bullet dodged. Then disaster struck several times. 

First, some new laws required that we save more data than before and make it more Accessible.   

The leadership at the time through together a little group to figure out what to do.  We had a broken system, constant server crashes, no support, and new requirements.   Oh. And no money. 

So they decided, over my hesitant objection, that “this looks like it could be done in SharePoint” and some consult company totally sold them on it.  

SharePoint was free for us using an Enterprise license and “Pr0nAltAcc is good at Computer stuff.  He can figure it out”. So the decision was made.  

Second, the first “SharePoint developer” we hired rage quit because the PM was “too critical”.    The next dev had some really unique ways to do stuff that we later learned no one else could figure out and had to be scrapped once we finally got more devs.     Then the PM quit.     Then the second dev quit.  Then the second PM quit.    Then my supervisor quit.    Got a better offer somewhere else and dipped about halfway through the build of the site collections.  

So after teaching a half dozen non-legal people the entire legal process multiple times, several requirements gathering sessions and story boarding and all that, we finally get the basic site collection built.    Now it’s time to migrate. 

Migrating lotus notes data into SharePoint lists is a nightmare.   Not only did we bust the threshold limits immediately, list column limitations forced us to make 30 separate lists to house the nearly 1200 data fields + attachments.    The SharePoint host nearly declined our site when we reached out with what we weee trying to do.   Ended up purchasing some software to make it a little easier and migrating everything mostly successfully.   

There was one small piece of the Lotus Notes stuff still active on the server.   It finally was migrated recently and now I am free of this burden.    

But now my problems really started.  You see, when the original Domino server was set up, and the Notes databases registered in our lifecycle management tool, they were listed under a special type of system so we could get better funding for it.    This came back to bite me in the cheeks because those special system  are built to be permanent and have secretariat level oversight on budgeting and management.   

So in order to stop having people constantly badgering me because the system was so out of date it was set to be removed from the network, I had to convince several levels of bureaucracy that the system didn’t exist anymore, even though the program name still existed because the old Supervisor of mine thought it would be a good idea to name to sharepoint the exact same program name, hence forcing it inherit all of its red tape and security requirements.  

During this time, Lotus Domino, now IBM Domino, was sold to a company overseas and the network security folks were adamant that it be shut down immediately.   So stuck between the NOSC and a Congressional data capture mandate, I did the only thing I could think of:  cracked open some old policy documents and started learning how one could decommission one of these special systems.   

After several weeks of emails and investigation, and a boat load of people wanting to each see for themselves the new SharePoint site and how it was used and was there any API or cloud storage or anything extra that kept it in the enterprise definition of a system (two or more hardware/software components used in conjunction) and thus keeping the old rules and red tape in place, today I FINALLY got the final all
Clear to shut down the old domino server and recategorize this special project.   

It’s been an exhausting journey, but I learned a lot.    I don’t think anyone in my office has any idea how close we came to losing the last ten years of data and what it took to move everything and change the categorization, but I know and now I can rest easy and get back to what my job description actually is. 

If you stuck around this long, thanks for reading.    

TLDR:  I migrated a Lotus system into SharePoint barely in the Nick of time before it got deleted by the network folks.   Then was able to convert the new site out of the governance that systems are required to have.",72,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF1C43D0>
169,We need more phone lines!," 

What a roller coaster today has been. The place I work has about 400 employees, everyone has their own phone number, on top of this about 60 folks are in a call center capacity taking calls that come in on a toll-free number. Because of all this our system is configured for a capacity 46 local calls at a time (23 dedicated to callers into our toll-free line, and another 23 lines for the rest of the business to share, excess calls to the toll T1, will roll over to the second set of local lines), with room for another 23 long distance calls, and 23 international calls (we mostly support only local folks, but sometimes they move and we need service to allow them toll free access to our services). For those familiar with telephony, this is 4 T1's. 

Business has been picking up over the last year since the VID, and for the last 4 months pretty much we've been maxing out our capacity for locals calls the number of people dialing into the call center is taking up the 23 lines the rest of our business uses. People would get busy signals calling us, we would get busy signals making outbound calls, unless it was long distance, the we could make calls.  

Tickets started rolling in, ""My phone is broken"". No, we only have so many phone lines and they are all in use. Non call center people share phones lines with call center people for local calls, customers waiting takes up a phone line. You need to make calls early in day or late when usage is low. Rinse and repeat for 3 months. 

Tickets stopped coming in, but managers are finally complaining that their employees can't reach their customers, customers are upset. 

They come to me. Yes, I work in IT, but I'm Desktop Support, I deal with end points. There are specializations in IT, shit gets complicated. Problem is, we aren't big enough for a dedicated telephony guy. The guy I took over for was also desktop support, but in his previous life he was a phone guy. He was a key player setting up our current system. He trained us on basic configuration and end point troubleshooting. We do what we can, then outsource the hard stuff to our support vendor. This is the first place where I've had access to THE system. Since starting here I've received some additional training, and I spend off time learning up. After 2 years on the system, I can do day to day tasks, basic end point troubleshooting, configure new phones. Trunks? Routes? Gateways... Fuck Me. That being said, I'm really good with technology, and know enough about telephony to ask the right people the right questions to, and I’m always happy to engage our vendor for support when I can’t find an answer. 

I get to work ""Hey network engineer, can we add more T1's without upgrading hardware"" Sure go buddy, we have 2 open ports. 

Call Software company, ""Any additional software cost to increase capacity?"" Nope, go for its buddy. 

Call Telcom company, ""We are at capacity, how much to add another T1?"" $500 a month, let us know when to go. 

I submit ticket to our Software vendor to order the additional T1, and do the needed software config changes, cause I'm not touching it. 

Software vendor comes back and tell us they don't have contract with our telecom vendor, and we need to order directly through them, once line is ran, they'll come configure switches and software. 

Call Telcom to place our order, queue waiting. 

While waiting, we have managers asking us, are you sure it's a capacity issue, we remember having higher queues before and not getting busy signals. I show them real time data that shows 100% usage. I tell my boss that based on everything, they are remembering wrong, mis understood, or configuration has changed, fact is capacity right now is 46 for them based on current configuration. 

2 weeks later, no word from telecom, we escalate, ask to be prioritized because we don't like our customer being upset with us. They get us a PM assigned to finalize some details. PM comes back and says we have 4 T1's, here's how they are currently configured, how would you like the new 1 configured, and oh, btw, one of your T1's is throwing an error is not currently in service... 

I look at the email confused, their description of our service setup, doesn't match the description from the guy I took over for. 

At this point I call my network engineer; we review our hardware setup. We’re supposed to have 5 T1s, a total capacity of 121 lines. 23 lines for the toll line, then 43 for local calls. We notice that no calls are coming in on the line that’s supposed to dedicated to our toll line. We realize that when we switched toll providers, the lines weren’t moved, they forwarded calls to one of the other line groups instead. Since the change, we lost 24 lines. I guess the call center folks were on to something when they said we used to have more capacity. He also says he confirmed the line reported as down, isn’t down according to the switch, so it’s likely just not configured on the software. I'm able to confirm the line is indeed not included in either the local or long-distance route groups. When did this happen? Before my time is all I now. We’ve been without these lines for at least 3 years now. 

Now I call my telecom sales rep and we review what the PM send over, his notes don’t match hers. He does research, and finds we have a second account with 2 T1’s on it, that connected on our side, he also reviews my bill for my toll-free number with me, (he thinks he can beat their prices) and confirms that we are indeed no longer paying for a dedicated T1 for toll-free calls. 

I asked him how long that account has existed with the T1’s, and he tells me over 20 years, naturally I'm curious why we have this account if we aren’t using the lines. He thinks that we stopped using them when we upgraded our infrastructure 10 years ago to VoIP, and someone didn’t cancel these old lines. 

Silver lining though, instead of ordering a new line, he can migrate these lines to our current configuration, we’ll just need to re-add them to our switches and configure them in software, no waiting to roll a truck for a new run. 

I found a current bill for the T1’s we didn’t know about. The current rate for these is 2700 a month, and we have used these lines in nearly 10 years!! 

I also found out, we don’t have any lines just for international calls, all international calls are just ran through our long-distance provider, so any of the lines can be used for that since they all are configured to support long distance. 

So, where’s all this leave us? I have 24 lines already configured on the switch that just needs to be enabled in the software. 

We have another 46 lines already connected to the building, just needs to be connected to switch, configured on switch, and enabled in software. 

We don’t need to set aside 24 lines to support international calling, any line can handle it. 

10 years ago, someone forgot to cancel our account, we’ve been paying on out of service lines since. 

We don’t need more phone lines; we need to use what we already have. 

Instead of spending an additional 6k a year, we’re going to re-bundle the account we forgot about, have more lines for our call center and other employees, and probably end up saving 12k a year compared to our current bill. Boss very happy. 

  
TLDR: Ordered additional phones lines from provider, instead found out we’ve been paying for lines we haven’t been using for the last 10 years. Re-connecting these lines to our switches will double our capacity, solving issues we’ve been having for the last year.",32,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF1C4430>
170,And yet another take on bosses,"Here's another story about ""Fred"", the boss from my ""Another take on bosses"" post.

A little background:

The structure of our organization was roughly this:  The national boss of our Field Service/Tech Support force was ""Harry"", who's office was in a different building from us.  Harry worked in our HQ office and had one support person, essentially a secretary.   

Under Harry was Fred and another manager based on the other side of U.S.  Under Harry was me, a tech support specialist, a parts manager, and a bunch of techs spread out from Houston to Anchorage.

I was very involved in day to day operations, following up with customers, making sure everyone was getting their paperwork handled (time sheets, expense reports, service reports, stuff like that).  I had no responsibility for billing, if a new device got installed I flagged it up to Harry's secretary, who made sure it got added to the correct customers contract.  Things were pretty swell, Fred and I had things pretty much on rails.

Then came ""surprise Monday"".   I showed up to the office as usual, Fred was always there early since he like to beat the rush hour traffic.   Fred calls me into his office right away and asks me to close the door.  I was pretty sure I wasn't in trouble, but something was up.

Fred:  Harry was fired over the weekend.   Sergi (international boss) flew in Saturday and let him go.

Me:  (Totally astounded), What happened?  

Fred:  This (shows me an ""invoice aging"" report he has on his desk).

We spent some time going over it.   We has a ton of customers who were way past 90 days on paying their monthly bills.   A bunch more are at the 60 day mark.   And its not just our customers, the same thing is true for the customers on the East Coast.    Turns out Harry was not passing any of this information on to Fred or the other manager, he didn't want them ""bothered"" with receivables, he would deal it.   Only clearly he hadn't been handling it and the axe finally fell.  Fred had orders from Sergi, ""get this cleaned up RIGHT NOW"".  

The aging report was the old green bar fan fold type, Fred opens it to where there are two halves, and tears it, hands me one half, and says, ""Get on the phone with these folks.  You know them all, it should be easy to get this cleared up.  I'll handle the other half"".

The next couple of hours were some of the strangest in my career.  I had customers say things like, ""I've been wondering when you guys were gonna call about this"", to others saying ""I've told you folks a dozen times that you need to put PO number xyz on your invoices or we can't legally pay them!""   It was pretty embarrassing, apparently Harry and his secretary had totally dropped the ball, it was kind of a miracle that we were collecting ANY billing.  It was clear that a ton of invoices were going to have to be credited and re-issued.  A few had minor problems that a customer could initial changes on and submit to their accounting folks.   Some charges had been incurred in a customers previous fiscal year and we had to write them off.  It was pretty much a nightmare.

Fred and I sat down at the end of the day and compared notes, we had to email our accounting folks a ton of revisions, credits, re-bills, we looked like total idiots, (well Harry did, but he was gone).  Anyway, over the next couple of billing cycles we collected on a HUGE number of outstanding invoices, and after this we totally lived and died by the aging report.  

What was cool about this, really the only cool thing, was that Fred totally trusted me to jump into this crisis and help him out.  Neither one of us had to deal with anything like this.   It was a mess that I hadn't created, but I got to help clean it up, and it felt pretty good to be part of the solution.   Fred and I worked more as peers to fix this, it was cool.

After we had caught our breath we started auditing what was being invoiced against what we knew was actually on the maintenance contract.  No one will be surprised that we found a huge number of devices that had been installed but never added to the billing.  So we had a whole other round of calling customers and warning them that their billing was going to increase in a big jump, due to ""someone's incompetence"".

171,Trouble to remote in to user's desktop,"Okay this gonna be a very short story. 

A little background that I was working in a BPO IT service desk voice account and pretty much support most app and sites in their company computer. For this story we had a special tool (not sure if unique) to easily remote in to company computer with admin access/rights.

Okay now for the short story.  

A user called in having issues with her outlook on her computer, after some probing seems I need to remote in to see to really understand her issue. So I gave her the address to for me to remote in but seems having trouble accessing the site, at first I gave her the shortcut link, getting can't reach this page then I gave the full URL of the remote in site still same issue then she said she'll try something. So I wait then after few min the invite to remote me in came through to me but something seems different.

I was connected and I ask for me to take control but the mouse keeps moving, so I asked again to please to not use the mouse for now, she answered that she was not touching her mouse at all. Then I finally asked if this is her pc I am connected to, she said no it's my colleague's. I muted and took a deep breath, and then asked why was I in her colleague's pc. She said she asked him if he could access the site to remote me in, and since he could she continued with the steps to get me in.

So I gently explained to her that for me to remote in to her computer she need to access the site in her computer not someone else's, then she let out a loud and long ""ooohhhh"". Then after a few tries I was able to remote in and fix the issue.

Note: at that time I was not familiar with RDP, MSRA, or quick assist. Also with the special app to remote in we are able to jump in to her computer from our end but as by our policy that should be our last resort.",6,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF1C44F0>
172,Mystery High Pitch Tone,"I work for a school district so we have an all call system that is constantly on the fritz. We got called to a classroom because of a ""annoying high pitched tone"". When I rounded the corner and could immediately hear it. It was very loud and ear piercing. I walk into the room and it sounds like it's coming from the ceiling but honestly its so high pitched it's hard to tell. Confirmed it is definitely not the fire alarm. 

My coworker goes to grab a ladder so we can get in the ceiling and check the speakers. As he leaves to go get the ladder, the teacher says ""alright class lets get out of here while they work, bring your things"". As the students all pack up and head out the door, the sound begins to move closer to me. I lean in to this kid's backpack and sure enough there it is! I said ""dude that's coming from your bag!"" and he immediately got red faced... it was an engineering project he was on for school... lol

Love an easy fix.

Update: teacher came in EOD to apologize for wasting my time. I made sure he knew this was the funniest part of my week thus far. Not a waste of time at all.",82,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF1C4550>
173,Calling in for support vs emailing in,"So the place that I work for, we try to train people to submit a ticket through email. But people still insist on calling in, and we take the call, make a ticket, and say that someone will get with them to take care of the issue. 

This relieves the 20-40 + minute interruption of people calling to get faster service. 

&#x200B;

Got a call Monday, about 5 mins before a scheduled appointment, took the call, opened a ticket for the user and said that someone would be with them shortly to take care of it. 

She lost her cookies. Screaming at me, that the reason she calls is because she gets faster service.  I responded with, well im sorry, we create tickets for people who call in, so that you dont jump ahead of the people who have already submitted a ticket via website,email, etc. She just cant wrap her mind around this I guess.

She tells me that her problem is easy, and that she just needs someone to do it now. I think to myself, well if its that easy, how come you are not doing it yourself? 

I assure her that someone will reach out to her regarding the ticket in a bit. 

I take my next appointment, finished it in about 5 mins, rather than the 30 mins I had planned. I decide to go and look at this ticket that the lady called in screaming at me for. Found the ticket, no one was assigned to it yet, Assigned it to myself, and took a look at the PC from our RMM. I found the issue to be that her HDD was full, as to why the PC was so slow. 

Ran a script through the RMM to clean up %temp%, temp, and run disk cleanup. 

Cleaned up about 25Gbs, told her she was all set in the ticket, and told her what I did.

She replied back with ""K"".

UGH I wanted to un-do what I did, and let her suffer longer, but im too nice and want people to have a good experience with us. This is why I try to never do stuff over the phone when people call in, they expect too much, drop everything your doing and help me. Sorry, there is a process that you are not adhering to.

""One of the other techs would drop what he was doing to help me""   
sorry, he's not supposed to to. 

Come on Friday 5pm.. im ready...",119,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF1C45B0>
174,The Tale of the Project De Caca,"Inspired by the tales of the Agency from  [**Mr\_Cartographer**](https://www.reddit.com/user/Mr_Cartographer/)   and a very nice pretty please from [**LeahInShade**](https://www.reddit.com/user/LeahInShade/), I decided to write out the saga of the Project de Caca.  Hopefully this telling will forestall future blood pressure spikes when I retell it by leaching some of the poison of it from my brain.  I swear I get wound up at the thought of it every time I tell it, even it years later.  

I am VERY long winded.  This may end up being a very a long read, so be warned.  I am also having a glass or 2 of wine while writing so make what you will of that.

Now to start, I like this job, I am in fact still employed at the same company. (albeit after a merger and  few acquisitions and a name change and a location change...LOL)  Every workplace has its Achilles heel and this project was the one I had the misfortune of being immersed in.  Most of the major players have since moved on to other jobs as well.  My current leadership has been encouraging me to come to them if anything like this happens in the future though my warnings were for naught.  That encouragement has kept me at my job.  Now on to the tale...

&#x200B;

I am not strictly an IT person, I ended up falling into the role of database developer and discovered that I really liked relational databases and that I loved the process of turning a pile of trivia into actual useful information that people could use to make decisions.  At this job, I was slowly becoming less of a code monkey and more of what is now called data science. (though I do have love / hate relationship with statistics, so I am not officially there)

We were given the project of creating an application for a division that did some custom reporting for our firm.  We had lots of canned reports doing similar things, but this might be doing things like testing the waters for 2 clients to merge or grouping product contracts in novel ways, so it needed some high touch analysis.  This analysis was being done on Excel spreadsheets as these things often are...especially at the time.  The problem as we were presented it we had a few issues to be solved.

1.  Make sure the analysis used a standard methodology.  Excel spreadsheets allowed each analyst to tweak their own version and these were beginning to be a problem as different results could be found depending on the analyst assigned.
2. Allow versioning of the reports. These were often tweaked and re-done several times and having all the versions in one neat and defined place made things easier to send the ultimate report to the customer.
3. Unspoken to me, but apparently not on the radar really was to make the process faster and easier.  As I discovered, this not at all a consideration.  As someone who fell into the profession I have through a lot of laziness and a burning desire to not do more busy work than necessary, this seems like a no brainer to me, but alas, was not to the progenitor of this project.

So, to start out with the analysts had to be ""protected"" from us as they were far too busy to tell us about the process or how we could translate this into a standardized process.  We had to glean this from meetings with the manager and no one else.  Now I do not dislike this manager, but managers are not very effective if they are so far in the trenches that they can give a good account of the day to day processes.  Not great, but not the worst, we did get some good info to get started.  I was not thrilled but not truly exposed to the horrors that would come.

So to start, a subset of data was pulled from a database.  Cool....a little investigation told us that database pulled from a database we owned....double cool.  Let's go to the source that we know when it was last updated.  Fresher data is better...right?  Hold up there Satan, apparently there was some special juju about this outdated copy of the database.  Why was this special?  We never got a straight answer, but nevertheless, we had to jump through the 7 flaming hoops of fire to get access of an outdated copy of our own damn data to get to the next step.  Ironically we were asked to run a special update to this outdated copy several times once they discovered we held the keys to get it back up to date.  

So we proceed to designing in the processes and formulas that were in the excel spreadsheets.  Remember, one of the explicitly stated objectives was to standardize this process so different analysts would at least start with similar reports for the same data.  We spend months hashing and re-hashing this so we understand all of the rules and exceptions to the rules and times when the rules are ignored and start the process of getting the process in place.  

Now an analyst would select a dataset and start working.  The smart way to do this would be to set a default data set, allow the analyst to make changes if they were needed, then run it through the standard process unless there was a need to do something so custom the excel made more sense.  That would be too easy.  We presented this and the brakes were quickly applied.  ""We need more flexibility.""  So....standardizing the process is not ok now??!  Apparently it was not.  How DARE we try to put these calculations in the database, out of the reach of the analysts.  They need more CONTROL.  The calculations MUST be done in Excel.  Sigh.

So apparently we have thrown out reason number 1 for doing this project now...months into it no less.  Unspoken reason 3 is also gone since, if the calculations are handled in Excel, we are back to square 1 in time and burden on analysts. So now we are left with reason 2 as the sole reason we are spending over $500K on this project over and above the salaries of FTEs like me who could be doing something useful.  Was this money really effective for the only stated purpose that was left....keeping track of versions of the report?  This is where stressful project went to absolute crap in an instant.

So at this point I really started questioning what we were doing.  Keeping track of versioning was something that could be better handled by Sharepoint.  Why were we building a whole application instead?  I start floating this question up.  Our biggest raison d'etre has now been invalidated and version control is no longer enough to keep us going on this road...or so I think.  Why on earth would someone state they needed consistency then kill it immediately in a desire for each analyst to have ""control"".  This is making no sense and the data structures that are starting to come down the pipe are making less sense.

At this point I start putting out the ""What are we really doing?"" emails.  I outline what we were told were the stated objectives.  Point out how objective 1 has been savaged.  How objective 3 could be achieved if the current project was completely revamped and how objective 2 was easily achievable with Sharepoint.  We have no real objectives anymore.  We are floundering in a horribly complex process where we are told we are doing it wrong, but taking way too long to be told why.  We would try something ....get told it was wrong , then wail a week or two to get a meeting with the manager to find out the problem was semantic or minor.  All this hoping that the actual analysts would not have some completely different take.

I think the worst part of the response to the what are we doing emails was not that I was wrong...no they agreed with every point...then declared it irrelevant without explaining why.  yes, it was true that we were not standardizing the process, but that was irrelevant.  No we were not simplifying the process, but the salespeople would have this nifty versioning control and the analysts could be ordered to use the process so it ""was not a burden"".  

Then I was asked if I thought I would be blamed for the failure.  I was incredibly insulted.  I was doing my best to be a team player, a good steward of company resources and I was being accused of totally self serving CYA??  Dot get me wrong, CYA has saved me many times, but there was more than enough documentation of just who orchestrated this steaming pile already, I was just trying to stop it from piling higher.  There was line of projects waving fists full of money at our division trying to get us to do their projects....more useful projects too.  That is when I heard the fateful words...""well there is a lot of political pressure to do this the way they want it.""  

&#x200B;

I do not know the name of the progenitor of this project.  I do not know what blackmail he had on the other people who had projects they wanted completed by my group.  Whatever he had, it was explosive.  I can only dream of this blackmail material.  He managed to jump a lot people who brought millions into the company and actually had GOOD ideas that would grow the business and benefit customers for something that was now best handled by Sharepoint ...and it WOULD NOT STOP.

&#x200B;

Now that the flex has happened, we were helpless.  We could not push back against any requirement no matter how stupid .  The process now evolved to new heights of idiocy.  We were required to have a process than would pull records manually selected from the database into Excel.  Any attempt tp automate this pull was violently rejected.  No matter how many manual overrides were offered, it was never enough control.  So the record selection process was unchanged.  Sadly, this was a high water mark.  next we exported this into Excel where each analyst would apply their own version of the massaging of this data.  No standardization was allowed!  The all powerful CONTROL needed to be honored.  So far so no change.  

Now we had to load the data from Excel back into the database.  This is where things go from bad to abjectly stupid.  Remember that our last, really awful, reason for doing this project is so we could keep track of multiple versions?  In order to do all our calculations in Excel and re-load these back into the database, The only way to do this is to overwrite the previous version of the analysis in the database.  The last fig leaf has been striped from this project. All versioning still must be kept in various Excel documents and we still are not keeping them version controlled in Sharepoint.  Nope, we are willy nilly just writing over a database version so we can see the see the software unfold the damn graphs in a pretty manner in front of a customer.  Heck, lets be honest, we cant even manage that much.  The pretty flowering pie chart is locked behind our firewall, unless the customer comes onsite for a presentation, they are seeing a PDF of that cool pie chart, not it unrolling in front of them.

Around this point I really start drinking too much.  I HATED this project.  It was incredibly stupid.  It took loads of analyst time.  The analysts were the bottleneck in this process.  Remember how their time was WAAYYYY too valuable to talk to us at the beginning...or ever. (our time was not valuable AT ALL /s)  So we have a process that: 

1. Takes longer than the old process. and takes more analyst time than the old process

2.  Is not more reproducible than the old process.

3. Is as bad or worse at versioning than the old process.  (Since they are pretending it is better they are not doing as good a job of keeping track)

4.  Has a UI that cannot be fully exploited to the target audience. (PDFs were actually inferior to the Excel graphics that could be tweaked during discussions)

5.  Required re-tooling and re-training of existing systems and people.  I focus on the analysts, but the salespeople had to adjust too.  I could not see them being happy with this adjustment to an actually inferior product for their purposes.

My conclusion was that a few people would use it to see the new shiny sparkly, then would quickly become disenchanted as they discovered the digital equivalent that glitter is actually craft herpes and they have to deal with this huge steaming pile in front of customers.  The salespeople (who always get the management love notes) would demand the old process and this would, at best fade into obscurity.... taking $500K + and untold amounts of productivity with it.  Surprising me not in the slightest, that is exactly what happened.  There were update processes that had to managed.  I managed them al of 3 times.  Very quickly I was the last person with institutional knowledge to kick this off.  Every 6 months or so, there was an attempt to revive this.  I would kick it off...they would discover why no one else was using this product and go back to Excel without the crazy useless DB process...until someone else was told this was what they were supposed to do before they learned better.

&#x200B;

Midway through the abortive stop start of actually using this process my old manager revisited it.  Apparently because it was not being used enough, the thought was to add more features.  OMG nobody learned it was a awful gumming up of a difficult process that could have been simplified, but any attempts at making the process BETTER were REJECTED resoundingly.  Instead we need a brighter shade of lipstick on this pig and it would be the best thing EVER!  I express this  view strongly!  Once again I am insulted.  Well this does not come out of our department's budget, we do not need to worry.  

&#x200B;

Thankfully this died exactly as quickly and unused as I expected.  It would have done far more damage if it had been forced to be used as intended.  I am still angry at the utter uselessness of this in a an otherwise useful and contributing company.  There were real problems that needed solved in other parts of the company.  There were real contributions we could have made to this division.  Instead, we were blocked at every turn and all my ""leadership"" could do is bleat about political pressure.",22,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF1C4610>
175,User seen something on YouTube,"So I do IT in healthcare recently we had someone come in and push a digital transformation where instead of deploying actual workstations we give people laptops. People have gone from being used to having workstations with two monitors to having a laptop and a few lucky people have been supplied with small portable tablet style monitors.

Now here I am get a phone call from my team lead telling me to go help a user who was given a laptop, but prefers having two monitors like she was used to. She informs me that she’s having trouble setting up dual monitors on her laptop, I think simple enough, right ?

Wrong she then pulls out two laptops, one a 7 year old personal laptop and her new company supplied one, she then plugs one hdmi into her old laptop and the other into her new laptop. I watch in amazement cause it is the silliest thing I have ever seen someone do at work. I inform her that even tho she has them plugged into each other and the laptops recognize that somethings plugged into the hdmi port it’s not going to work. She replies to me “that’s not true I seen someone do it on YouTube with a tv” I said well that makes sense it’s a tv and a tv is essentially a monitor. She say so is this laptop, I say can you show me the video you found and the guy was indeed connected to a TV. I was at a loss for words after that because she kept insisting it was possible. I then told her let me try something and launched cmd entered ipconfig a few times and then told her again it wasn’t possible.

Morale of the story is when a user tells you they seen something on YouTube just know your in for a ride!",28,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF1C4670>
176,Users Always Lie!,"I am not a Tech Person but I love this sub. I have learned so many simple lessons like 'make sure everything is actually turned on'  and 'check all the cords'. So when I attempted to walk my 80 year old father through 'fixing' his TV over the phone in a snowstorm, I started with all the simple things first. I told him to get the cable remote and the original remote that came with the TV when he bought it. He said he had them. So after 20 minutes, we finally got the cable box on and the TV turned on at the same time. We just needed to change the input on the TV to cable. The whole 20 minutes it took just to get this far, I had been saying to pick up the TV remote and do X, put it down and use the cable remote to do Y, and he was following my directions pretty well. Finally I told him to find the input button on the TV remote. 

DAD: There isn't one.

Me: Do you have the right remote? The one that came with the TV when you originally bought it?

DAD: Yes it's the TV remote.

ME: OK starting at the top, read all the names of the buttons.

He reads all the buttons starting with on/off all the way to the bottom of the remote. He never reads off 'input'. Hmmm. OK, I try to google the TV remote for his TV, because the input button has to be somewhere. But nothing I find for his TV matches the remote he says he has. I even think 'Users Always Lie' and make him read the label on the back of the TV to check that the brand he told me was right. Finally, I start grasping at straws.

Me: Is there a word written at the very bottom of the TV remote?

Dad: Yes I says ""Spectrum"".

Me: No, not the cable remote, the TV remote.

Dad: This is the TV remote.

Me: No, Spectrum is the cable company. Get the other remote for the actual TV.

Dad: What do you mean? There isn't one. There is only 1 remote.

Me: What?

Dad: Yeah, TV and the cable work with the same remote. You know that.

Me:.....

Me: I can't help you any more. How about I come over when the roads are clear in a day or 2. Maybe I can fix it in person. Keep your radio on.

So yeah. The whole time I was saying 'Pick up the cable remote and do X, put it down, now pick up the TV remote and do Y', he was picking up and putting down the same, single remote control over and over again. 2 days later I drove 45 minutes to his house to push the 2 buttons it took to change the input on the TV. Users Always Lie!

EDIT:  I literally said ""Get the remote that came with the TV when you bought it. It is in the left hand drawer of the stand, right under the TV. It has a sticker that says TV on it."" He says 'Ok, hang on' When he came back to the phone he said 'Got it' I said ""So you have both remotes, the cable one and the Tv one?"" and he said yes again!

177,The Agency: Part 8 - Epilogue,"Hello everyone!  This is the last story in the saga of my time at **$Agency**, where I'll let you know what happened after I left.  All of this is from the best of my memory along with some personal records, but ultimately it is how I remember things.  There certainly can be some inaccuracies.  Also, I don't give permission for anyone else to use this.

TL/DR: Yeah, I don't do that.  Enjoy the story :)

Again, for context, I am not in IT; rather, I'm a GIS (Geographic Information Systems) professional.  This particular world is quite small, so I will do what I can to properly anonymize my tale.  For reference, during the course of these stories I had been employed at a research agency affiliated with a major university.  Here is my Dramatis Personae:

* **$Me**: I wonder who this could be!
* **$Agency**: Research agency where I had been working.
* **$BadMike**: My first nemesis.
* **$MrScott**: Very nice guy, very smart, and completely clueless as a manager.  Had been sort of my superior when I left.
* **$DragonLady**: The director of $Agency.  Brilliant, great fundraiser, and terrible at managing people.
* **$AwesomeBoss**: Operations manager.  Very awesome, very chill and approachable yet extremely competent.
* **$AwesomeRed**: Very awesome and intelligent analyst.  She had been my best friend in the office.

So I wanted to let you all know the fallout as to what happened after I left during my time at **$Agency**.Here you go!  This is all based on gossip, hearsay, a little bit of internet investigating, and communication with my old friends, so there could be something wrong here.  Oh well.  All this was way too much for any of the previous stories, so I made this a new tale all its own.  I hope you have enjoyed everything!  Thanks, folks :)

**Story the First: $Agency**

Just after I left, a position was posted to replace me.  Much to **$DragonLady**'s chagrin, it turns out that skilled, experienced GIS personnel are not willing to work for peanuts.  Folks with undergrad degrees and tons of experience didn't even want to interview, and folks with higher degrees demanded more than she was willing to pay.  The job description was posted and reposted, in various forms, over two years.  They never found someone.  Eventually, they just removed the position altogether.  I think this was simply due to changes in the way they operated and ultimately the inability to get a suitable candidate.

As an aside, **$DragonLady** had told me (in the last story) that the pay bands for these sorts of jobs were very restricted.  Turns out, *that's not true*.  There actually is a lot of leeway in how these bands are structured, even in the public sphere.  In most cases, the agency itself defines the pay bands for each position.  I speculate that the only reason the analyst position was getting paid so little was because some of the other employees with higher degrees were not making very much, and **$DragonLady** could not bring herself to ensure that a ""lay person"" was getting the same pay as a ""real academic.""  Hey, if you're going to shoot yourself in the foot, you can, I guess.  To each their own.

In the meantime, they tried other approaches to get staff.  The first thing I heard about was that they reached out to the new graduate students in the Geography department.  This was similar to the way that I had been brought on board - I had started working at **$Agency** as an assistanceship to pay for tuition; they offered me a job at the end of it and I accepted.  In this case, they did the same with some of the new students, but under the stipulation that they wanted the grad students to stay on board for a few years once their assistanceships ended.  They did not get a single candidate.  Literally none of the students wanted to stay.  I think it was the combination of low pay, **$DragonLady**'s terrible management, and the fact that these grad students now had a world of opportunities available to them.  After a few years, **$Agency** ended this program.  In my case, I'd had some personal issues, I was local, and the job offer had come at a time when I really needed it.  But I had wound up being the exception, not the rule, and most other students were not in the same boat.  If you'll remember, **$FTW** had originally told the leadership of the agency to ""do everything in their power to keep me.""  With me gone, those words proved to be prophetic.

**$Agency** then started reaching out into other schools and disciplines to try and hire someone.  Eventually, they found a graduating student I'll call **$DoucheBaggins**.  **$DoucheBaggins** just so happened to have worked on some major project with an affiliated discipline and had gotten published because of it.  Apparently, his head grew two times bigger because of this.  He was, by all accounts, the penultimate diva.  He was also *stupid as f\*ck*.  He would be given GIS assignments - simple stuff since everyone has to pay their dues and learn the basics - and would screw every bit of it up.  He'd then sulk and complain that he should be doing ""real research,"" not this petty, pedantic stuff.  After all, he was ""too talented"" to be doing work of this kind.  Apparently, the management at **$Agency** caught on a little quicker this time than they did with **$BadMike**.  After about a year or so, **$DoucheBaggins** was fired.  Not ""allowed to work until the end of his contract"" (as **$BadMike** had been able to).  Rather, he was literally walked out - as in, security guards coming to the office, telling him to gather his sh\*t, and then escorting him to the door.  He is the first and only employee of **$Agency** that I know of that has ever been directly fired.  Lol.  I sort of wish I could have seen that.

So apparently, this additional approach to trying to gain more GIS personnel didn't work either.  **$Agency** eventually resorted to hiring contract professionals - people that are considered experts and command a very high rate of pay.  If they wound up working out, they'd be offered a full-time contract.  That's seemed to work for **$Agency**.  I think **$AwesomeBoss** has had a huge impact here, as well, since it seems she is now in charge of most of her team's hiring and operations and has mostly removed **$DragonLady** from that process.

And speaking of **$AwesomeBoss**, she's done a great job.  She's managed to consolidate all the GIS responsibilities under her position.  She now has a very large team with excellent capabilities working for her.  Their GIS capacity is top-notch.  She also works as a ""shield"" for her team against **$DragonLady**'s outbursts, and does what she can to give her crew reasonable directives.  That's been very stressful on her, but has allowed her team to flourish.  Honestly, if not for **$DragonLady**'s mismanagement, I think that the GIS team at **$Agency** would rival the best in the industry (or even the world, for that matter) :)

**Story the Second: $MrScott**

This is somewhat sad, but honestly quite well-deserved.  In the months after my departure, **$MrScott**'s position at the agency was given a good, hard look.  About six months later, he was stripped of his management title, ostensibly so that he could ""focus on his research.""  I expect there were a bunch of things that went on behind the scenes in this - here are my speculations:

* First off, there wasn't any need for two managers of the GIS team.  There never had been.  **$AwesomeBoss** had effectively centralized most of the operations under her.  **$MrScott** didn't really do anything in this regard except act as a stumbling block in the process.
* Second, his attitude to the other GIS personnel was terrible - his demeanor in a lot of things was really insulting and he honestly didn't understand what the rest of us did.  I remember that we had hired a new GIS employee the same week that I put in my notice.  **$MrScott** was onboarding her, trying to explain our file architecture to her and bumbling his way through it.  Since I had exactly zero f\*cks left to give, I interrupted them and told her, ""Yeah, that's not how we do this.  I'll show you later.  You can speak to **$AwesomeBoss** about it too.""  **$MrScott** looked a little sheepish and actually admitted that he didn't use the system a lot.
* Finally, when I left, I took a lot of productivity and institutional knowledge with me.  I think **$DragonLady** may have been looking for someone to pin that blame to, and **$MrScott** was a perfect scapegoat.

So **$MrScott** was removed from his position of leadership.  This had more implications than you first might believe.  You see, for years, it had been the assumption that he would likely inherit the directorship of **$Agency** once **$DragonLady** retired.  He had worked there for over twenty years and was one of the employees closest to her.  He was involved in all meetings, discussions, and decisions.  Unfortunately, his removal from management was tacit admittance that he didn't know how to run a team.  And *THAT* meant there was no way he would be put into a position of leadership again - such as, say, inheriting the director position at **$Agency**.  I think that this realization must have crushed him.

About six months later, he found a new job.  It was a position somewhere out west.  He publicly stated to everyone that the new job was an opportunity he'd always wanted to do, that he was excited to leave.  Yet the twenty years he left behind, and the fact that only one year after he took this new job he found another one, seems to put that to the lie.  I think he had banked on taking over **$Agency**; once that was denied him, he simply wanted/needed to get away.

Honestly, I don't hold that much of a grudge against him.  He was a terrible boss, this is true, and he said some pretty terrible things to me when he was acting in that capacity.  If he ever tries to argue that point with me I'll show him these posts >:D  But as a person, he was nice and very smart.  I think that had he been in a position where he was working with peers all day - people that work *with* him, not *for* him - he would have thrived.  And I hope that wherever he eventually does find himself, he will be happy there :)

**Story the Third: $BadMike**

I could not have hated this man more when he was given the boot.

However, in the intervening years, I've managed to speak with a ton of colleagues that knew him or went to school with him.  Most have told me that he was incredibly stressed while working at **$Agency**.  I can believe that.  He apparently couldn't say no to **$DragonLady**, and originally this meant lots of working through the night, taking on massive projects, and doing more than he could feasibly do.  Eventually, it all caught up to him and he fell apart.

I don't think this accounts for everything.  While I can understand falling apart due to stress, his response to it - the laziness, the incompetence, the shirking of responsibility, the shifting of blame to others - was still unacceptable.  I think he still deserved to get fired.  However, I now also know how difficult it was to actually work for **$DragonLady** and **$MrScott**.  And while I still don't accept that what he did was ok, I can at least understand why it he did it.

And the many years that have passed since then have done much to cool my rage.  I know that he eventually wound up at a firm somewhere in the northeast, one with proper management.  Incredibly (to me most of all), *I'm not all that angry at him anymore*.  He's just **$Mike** now.  I hope he's been able to fix himself.  I hope that he's doing work he likes doing.  And, amazingly, I wish him well :)

**Story the Fourth: $AwesomeBoss**

This one is not so great.  First off, **$AwesomeBoss** has done an excellent job in her position.  She's managed to build and lead a GIS team that is fantastic within the discipline.  She is able to shield her employees from the outbursts of **$DragonLady**, and has done her best to support them in their professional careers.  She may not even see it this way, but she has done so much for **$Agency** and her people.  Honestly, I would work for her in a heartbeat if she needed me.

Unfortunately, all this dealing with **$Agency** has taken its toll on her.  She's admitted to coming home in tears over the frustrations that she's endured.  And the worst was something I heard from her recently, that putting up with everything has been ""emotionally traumatizing.""  It was hard to hear that from her.  I'm not sure where things will go or what she will decide to do.  But I've told her that if she ever needs anything from me, all she has to do is ask.

Ultimately, though, I have faith that things will work out well for her in the end :)

**Story the Fifth: $AwesomeRed**

**$AwesomeRed** continues to rock it at the agency.  She's been promoted, has her own office, and is part of the amazing team that **$AwesomeBoss** has put together.  She continues to great work and is advancing herself in her career.  Thankfully, she doesn't have to deal with **$DragonLady** much, either.  And as you can imagine, she continues to be my main source of gossip from the office :D  Anyways, whatever she decides to do with her career, I am certain she will excel at it!

**Story the Sixth: $DragonLady**

Not much has changed with her, to everyone's detriment.  She continues to mangle **$Agency** with her particular style of mismanagement.  That academic ego and misplaced desire for control seem to be at the heart of all her problems.  As time has gone by, any dipsh\*t could point this out to her based solely on the turnover at **$Agency**.  **$DragonLady** will go on a hiring spree, increase staffing by 50% or more, then the agency would gradually wither away as people would get fed up with her and leave.  Then, invariably, she'd go on another hiring spree and the cycle would continue.  As if each lesson needed to applied to her skull with all the subtlety of a sledgehammer.

I was informed of one of the best examples by **$AwesomeRed**.  About three years ago, **$Agency** hired a very high-profile doctoral researcher.  This woman had a particular research project that she had pioneered.  Once hired, she was given carte blanche to do whatever she wanted to get this research completed.  We're talking all the financial resources she'd need, whatever staff she needed, and full the academic support to work on a project she had developed herself.  *This is an academic wet dream*.  As such, **$Agency** started putting together the necessary team, adjusting staffing and procedures along the way.  About a year ago, just before the project was to go live, the researcher in charge of the project quit.  She left what must have been her dream job.  Why?  Because of **$DragonLady**.  With her leaving, the entire infrastructure of the team was thrown into disarray.  This was not some sort of isolated incident, as we have seen.  Virtually everyone leaving **$Agency** on their own capacity has done so because of **$DragonLady** \- **$FTW**, **$GoodMike**, **$GoldPhD**, and even myself, really.  That she cannot see this is an absolute travesty.

Unfortunately, until something happens regarding her management style, I don't believe that **$Agency** can become the world-class organization that I am certain it has the capacity to be.  It may be possible that **$DragonLady** could open her eyes and try to improve herself.  Yet plagued with the pride that suffuses everything she does, I think it is more likely that the moon will come out of orbit.  The more likely possibilities are that either she will be walled away from active operations as much as possible, that she will finally retire and the rest of **$Agency** can begin doing better work, or that everyone will get fed up and leave.  We will see.

Thankfully, though, I don't have to put up with this anymore.

**Story the Seventh: $Me**

As for me, I moved on to the municipality.  In the words of **$AwesomeBoss**, my career in the time since has been ""meteoric.""  I have learned so much and done so much.  I am amazingly happy with what I've been able to accomplish.  My coworkers are awesome and the atmosphere at the municipality is honestly fantastic.  It would really dox me to state my achievements here, but I feel like I merely have to set a heading and I can see myself through its end, no matter what it may be.  I didn't go into this career thinking that GIS was what I wanted to do, but these many years have taught me that I love this line of work, that I think I am good at it, and that it has been one of the most fulfilling things I've ever done.  If you told me ten years ago this is where I'd be today, I wouldn't have thought it possible.  Pretty amazing what can actually happen in life, isn't it?

:D

And that, my friends, is that.  Thus ends the saga of the **$Agency**.  Thank you all for reading my stories.  I hope you have enjoyed them!  And until next time, *don't forget to turn it off and on again* :)

178,Head of department. WheRe iS tHe MoNiTor?,"Happened yesterday.

I work for higher education college. My duties are to help staff members who need equipment for classes for visually impaired students and also students. If a staff member needs anything they need to put in a ticket request or we won't know...anyway..I'm in a middle of a call with someone, the head of the department comes starts to talk to me and I tell her I'm on the phone call via teams... She says it's urgent, I tell the other person I'm sorry this person incompetency is strong.

HOD: Hi, I requested a monitor for room XX

Me: strange I didn't any requests from your department, btw I'm on the phone

HOD: Oh... sorry, she tries to speak to my boss who's also  on the phone. She comes to me again, please we need the screen..

Me: okay I'll get the monitor and please put in a ticket.

HOD: thanks.

While I'm taking the screen down to the room, another member of department comes and asks about the screen... And I tell the situation.

She's done this multiple times, she's booked an incorrect room for the screen... She's a nightmare.",46,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF1C4790>
179,"As a matter of fact, YES, temperature affects electronics. Who knew?","Long time reader, first time posting. I do tech support for a midsized  company with offices in 4 states. I'm the only IT in the southern region, the rest are up north.     IT: me of course.  U$er: you know how it goes.

Some background, this user is an intern who just started a couple weeks ago. We tend to provide interns with the oldest laptops we have (not my idea, just tradition I guess).

U$er: Hey IT, I just tried turning my laptop on and it made this horrible sound, then just turned off. Can you fix it? I hope I didn't totally break it.

IT: Well let's take a look at it, will you set it on the bench and turn it on so I can here the sound? 

I have a dozen other problems to deal with this morning, hoping it was a fluke and the laptop will just boot up normally. But as she said, it powers on, makes a horrible screeching sound for about half a second, then shuts off.

I pick up the laptop, thinking I will need to pop it open to see if anything is out of place. The laptop feels like it's been in the fridge! Instantly, I know what the problem is.

IT: Did you leave the laptop in your car last night?

U$er: Yeah, so?

IT: It's too cold. Wait a little while then it will be fine.

U$er: That doesn't explain why it won't turn on or that noise, what do you really think is wrong with it?

IT: (already knowing what the problem is) I really don't know. I tell you what, I'll pop it open and take a look, then I'll bring it back to your desk when I've got it fixed.

She agrees then leaves my office. I continue what I was working on for about 10 minutes, then turn the laptop back on. It boots into the bios but does not detect the HDD. Turn it off, and come back in another 10 minutes. It boots straight into Windows like normal.

This laptop is from an age when spinning HDDs we're still common, before NVMe really took off. This isn't the first time one of our users has caused issues by leaving the machine in outside in the winter. Anyways, thanks for reading, and remember that user error is 80% of our problems in IT.

UPDATE: Thank you all so much for the support on this! And to those concerned with condensation, nothing to worry about in this case!",151,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF1C47F0>

181,Everyone's Outlook is Crashing,"I work at a vaguely Med/Pharma company. We have an IT department of 4 but I was the only one on-site for a while. Low man on the totem pole will do that to you. We work 8-5 but a few of the departments, especially a lot of the engineers, work 7-4. My mom happens to work at the same company (she got me the job) and on this day we were car-pooling. She was driving and I felt my work phone vibrate in my pocket with an IM. One of the engineers has an issue with his Outlook crashing and gets an error message telling him to try to start it in safe mode. He even sent a screenshot. I try to give him brief instructions and let him know I'll be there in about 30 minutes. If it doesn't work he will be my first stop when I get in. No dice, it keeps crashing even in safe mode. Also, all the other engineers in his cubicle pod are having the same problem. A couple minutes later, I get an email alert from our ticket system that one of the maintenance managers is having the same problem. I instantly assume the problem is with our Exchange Server, which is one of many systems I have no access to. Partly because I'm still a temp (in the middle of converting to being hired) and partly because it's good security to limit the number of privileged users. I forward this information along to the guy I work with who does have this access.

By the time I get to work, the engineers have done enough Level 0.5 troubleshooting and realized it's all happening when they open one specific email from another user, a program manager. Very thankful to have big pockets of competent users who try to solve their own problems. I contact the user who sent the email. She says she's already been told by the people she sent it to that it was causing problems. I had been concerned it might've been something malicious, but at least it was actually from her.

She told me what happened. They have a weekly standing meeting with about 8 people. She'd been taking notes at each of these meetings for all of 2021. Turns out she was trying to share the file and attempted to send it as an email attachment. The file was too big and told her as much. Naturally, she decided to instead copy and paste the contents of the document into the body of the email. We have network drives. We have Sharepoint. But no, she decided to *email* a 50 page document.",31,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF1C48B0>
182,another take on bosses,"I've been inspired by Mr\_Cartographers series of posts about bosses to add one of mine.

Long, long ago I was working as a Field Engineer for a computer company.  As the company grew, a new guy was hired as the supervisor for my group as we were adding new technicians in multiple locations on a regular basis.  We'll call him Fred.

Fred was a interesting mix of good and bad traits.   On the good side he had a strong desire to develop and coach members of his team.  On the bad side, he was a workaholic and expected folks to work as many hours as he was willing to.    What kept this from getting out of hand was the fact that all of us on his team were paid overtime, which got him in trouble with his boss if things went too far.   Also, his wife forced him to take vacations regularly, even though he constantly told us all stories of his father, who had only missed ONE day of work in his 30 year career!  

As time went on and the company grew, Fred got promoted up a rung and he selected me to step into his old position, so I moved into a management role.   One of my tasks was scheduling training and vacations for our team, which was spread out all over the western U.S.   This was not a huge deal, I created a calendar for the entire year and let all my techs know to put in requests with a reasonable notice and things should be ok.

One day one of my techs, Chuck, comes into my office with a vacation request.  Chuck was an excellent tech, customers loved him, and he never asked for anything unreasonable.  I checked my calendar, initialed the request, and asked him to show it to Fred just to be sure.

Chuck pops next door to Fred's office and suddenly I hear Fred yelling, he can't believe Chuck is asking for time off!  Chuck is ""never here""!  How dare he even think of asking for vacation!  I'm out of my chair and in the hall when Chuck, pale as a ghost, comes out of Fred's office.  The rest of the office staff is silent, staring toward the sound of the outburst.   I signal Chuck into my office, close the door, and ask what happened.  He has no idea, he just handed the paperwork to Fred, and Fred exploded.   I have no idea what set this off, but I take the request form, tell Chuck to leave it with me.  

My first impulse was to march into Fred's office and argue with him, but I realized that was probably a dumb idea.   I sat down and spent about ten minutes thinking through possible approaches, and came up with something that I thought would work.

I quietly walked into Fred's office, he was hunched over his desk, very tense, and I assumed he was a bit embarrassed since he knew everyone in the office had heard his tantrum.  I sat down opposite him and very quietly said, ""Fred, I need your help"".

Fred's manner changed quickly.  He relaxed and I could see he was going into his ""coach mode"".   I quietly explained that since he had put me into my supervisory position, I wasn't sure how to handle things like what had just happened.  Could he help me out?  What was I supposed to do?  I had verified that Chuck had the time off coming, and that there was nothing scheduled that we needed Chuck for.   Was there something I didn't know about?  

I asked all these questions in the calmest manner I could, I wasn't arguing with him, I was asking for his help.  

Fred replied that no, there was nothing I didn't know that would require Chuck to be available.  It just ""seemed like"" Chuck was ""always"" asking for time off, as were other people.   And some people were NOT taking vacation time, so why should Chuck?  He was kind of mumbling all this and I got a strong sense that he was stressed about something completely unrelated and had just exploded at Chuck as a kind of safety valve.   I quietly pointed out that I could not do the job he had put me in if he didn't trust me to make routine decisions.  Fred agreed and mumbled an apology, and said Chuck could have the time off.  I produced the request form and Fred signed it.   I thanked him and went to find Chuck and give him the good news.

After that incident Fred was a lot better about things, eventually I just stopped asking to sign off on small things.  He realized I was actually pretty good at my job and he didn't have to sweat the details, that was what I was there for.",54,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF1C4910>
183,The odyssey of my first IT job at a startup.,"So this story goes back to my first job out of college. (not counting theme park ride operator)

&#x200B;

I get hired on to be the ""IT Guy"" for a startup. Brand spanking new, 110% optimism, 33% dreams, and just enough BS to make the wheels spin. I show up on the first day and the founder shows up 5 minutes after me with the landlord and the landlord gives him the key and shakes his hand. I check the date on my watch and what do you know.. it's the first of the month.

&#x200B;

""What's going on?""

""Oh don't worry, first day in the office, the furniture and computers are being delivered this morning than we can start setting up computers and everything""

""OK""

&#x200B;

*BEST DAY EVER*

The founder is actually a hardware engineer and just hired me because his wife knows that he has too much on his plate to do all the IT stuff himself. So he opted to hire a cheap fresh IT guy because.. I'm cheap, and if anything pops up I can't handle he will still be there.

Let's be honest, 99% of IT is shit that we could have handled in highschool, it's that 1% that takes someone who knows what they are doing.

&#x200B;

A couple years roll past and the founders McGuffin 9,000 is working,  we score a government contract and use the McGuffins they made to collect data (not being more specific than that)

So they have these scientist guys out in the field collecting data on their first ever contract. First day out they go back to their hotel to upload the data and go to bed.

&#x200B;

7:00 am rolls around and they are at *7% transferred.* At this rate it will take over a week to upload every days worth of data

The founder/owner calls a meeting and drags everyone in. He has the best possible internet that can possibly be purchased, he's panicking... because no one ever thought to figure out how the data they actually collected can be moved. To put into perspective how much data needed moved on a daily basis, it's more data than my computer I owned at the time could store, compared to the home PC I have today it's a very sizable chunk of the hard drive. And the servers they had were extremely hard drive heavy. That's coming from an IT guy that they had large amounts of storage.

&#x200B;

I'm at a total loss, I was completely in over my head, and no ideas whatsoever on how to solve this problem.

&#x200B;

We are all at a loss and the receptionist who is fresh out of highschool and obviously hired for her ""extensive communication assets"" holds up her hand while the rest of us are standing around like idiots.

""Can we overnight  hard drives with UPS or something?""

I give that girl credit where credit is due. To this day I have yet to come up with a better solution given the limitations of  internet upload speeds. 

The next best solution was to rent a property and get a server grade internet connection hooked in, then have the field scientists sleep there.

&#x200B;

Ultimately, Fedex was chosen as the least terrible option.

So that's the solution... we directed the field scientist guys to sit around for a day to get new hard drives shipped in so they can copy the data, and send out another copy by Fedex to the office.

&#x200B;

And  we discovered that the fastest way to transfer large amounts of data from an Oklahoma Holliday Inn was to... to ship a box of hard drives across the country.

Thus started the most surreal data movement odyssey ever.

&#x200B;

 And the solution was to have enough back work to keep the office guys busy going over the data in case of bad weather or shipping issues caused problems. We switched to 3 day shipping to save money and kept a 1 week backlog of unprocessed data, to create a buffer so the processing team at the office wouldn't be stuck with nothing to do if the mail  came late or got lost, or the field team got rained out.

It even smoothed out one of the problems that didn't have a solution, which was what does the office staff do the day after a bad weather day in the field?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We ended up with an ungodly amount of drives floating around the country, about 95% made it through the mail with the data intact. But that was planned for.

&#x200B;

Our founder succeeded in his dream of selling his startup to a competitor for a huge pile of money and he lived happily ever after with a retired model and a Ferrari.

&#x200B;

I myself got a letter of recommendation and went on unemployment before moving back in with my parents, thus my plan to escape Florida ended in total failure.  Fuck the 2008 economic crisis.

&#x200B;

And no.. I didn't get any stock options, just a couple of shirts for a now defunct company.  When he started discussing pay I emphatically agreed to ""Whatever you think is fair sir"". Could I have gotten 2% of a metric shit-ton of money? I doubt it.. that bastard was smart enough to hire green employees when possible.",118,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF1C4970>
184,"Backups are a good thing, right? RIGHT?!","Hey there friends, long time lurker, first time poster here. Since I'm a chemist, this is most likely going to be my only TFTS post.

This all happened nearly ten years ago. Fresh out of college, I was working at an environmental chem firm for the volatiles department. Since we were testing for things that are normally gasses, we had a few special things about our department. Namely, our own room with overpressure. What that meant for us was that 30ish instruments running 24/7 are loud, and you get used to a certain level of background noise.

Our tech guy, Corey (name changed) was honestly great. Low ticket times, and he would be more than happy to explain a few things while he worked. He also religiously backed up our data. I don't remember if it was weekly or monthly, just that the backup happened Friday at midnight.

On to the tale! Being out of college, I was fine working a Tuesday through Saturday morning shift. One fateful Saturday I came in and remember thinking, ""huh, kinda quiet. Maybe everyone's stuff got done early."" It wasn't supposed to happen, but if its a slow day you can't help it. So I get started with the process. Print out last night's data, check the instruments.

Except, instrument one is stopped. No errors, just sitting there silently. Ok, this happens sometimes. Maybe the robotic arm got out of alignment or something. I pick up the very light pile of data and look where it stopped. Huh. Last run injected at 11:55 pm.

Check instrument two. Its also stopped. Chances of both instruments stopping? Low. Not zero, but less than 10%. Then it hits me. The silence is now much more ominous. Start checking the nearest instruments. Stopped. All of them. Entire department stopped with the last injections between 11:45 and midnight.

Aha! A clue! But first, lets test. Start instrument, run blank.

Error: method no longer exists or has moved.

Stare at screen. Stare. Shove down bubbling panic, try a different method, I have three I can use. Same error message.  Ok, this is obviously a department wide issue as the same error is on all the machines. Time to call in IT.

I really can't blame Corey for not answering the phone at 7 am on a Saturday. Leave a message, all instruments down, call back immediately please. I take fifteen minutes to do some data work, then call back. Nothing. Same message. Repeat five minutes later, getting more nervous as there isn't anything I can get done.

Realize I have to kick this one up the chain. Sorry Corey, three calls in a half hour from the company phone line should have been a clue. Call my boss. No answer, leave a message. Wait five. Call bosses boss. No answer, leave a message. Wait five minutes. Nothing.

At this point, I'm glad I didn't eat breakfast. Because having worked here less than six months, I now need to call and wake the Lab Director up on a Saturday. Make the call, he answers immediately and doesn't sound drowsy. Fill him in, he reassures me he will handle it.

Half hour later, Corey pops his head in and asks what instruments need started first. I let him know, and within ten minutes I'm back at work.

Aftermath.  Once I got caught up and saw Corey wasn't busy, I asked him what happened, just in case it happened again. ~~Apparently when setting up the backup, there is a checkbox asking about saving the methods. Instead of save them and leave originals, he clicked transfer to backup.~~ Quick edit to put a more likely box option as I have forgotten the original dialogue. The backup transferred everything, and he forgot to mark the method files as an exception. One missed check box. At 15 minutes per sample on the instrument, the timing of everything stopping made sense. It finished the run, then couldn't find the method to do the next one. The good news was it was the weekend so nothing ended up being late, and there weren't any more issues with backups as far as I can remember.",13,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF1C49D0>
185,"The Agency: Part 7 - Farewell, Adieu, Auf Wiedersehen, Goodbye","Hello everyone!  This is the next-to-last story in the saga of my time at **$Agency**, where it all ends.  All of this is from the best of my memory along with some personal records, but ultimately it is how I remember things.  There certainly can be some inaccuracies.  Also, I don't give permission for anyone else to use this.

TL/DR: Yeah, I don't do that.  Enjoy the story :)

Again, for context, I am not in IT; rather, I'm a GIS (Geographic Information Systems) professional.  This particular world is quite small, so I will do what I can to properly anonymize my tale.  For reference, during the course of these stories I was employed at a research agency affiliated with a major university.  Here is my Dramatis Personae:

* **$Me**: I wonder who this could be!
* **$Agency**: Research agency where I was working at the time.
* **$MrScott**: Very nice guy, very smart, and completely clueless as a manager.  Sort of my superior at this point.
* **$DragonLady**: The director of $Agency.  Brilliant, great fundraiser, and similarly terrible at managing people.
* **$AwesomeBoss**: Operations manager.  Very awesome, very chill and approachable yet extremely competent.
* **$AwesomeRed**: Very awesome and intelligent analyst.  She was my best friend in the office.

Last time we left off, I had just gone on paternity leave to help care for my newborn daughter.  Her birth galvanized me to do my best and try to improve myself and my career.  Today, we'll see how all that panned out.  No spoilers but the title might just give everything away :)

I returned back to work in the early part of the new year and I hit the ground running.  Not only was I inspired to do my best thanks to the new addition to my family, I was also actually well-rested and relaxed from the paternity leave.  Let that sink in.  Caring for a newborn is no joke - kudos to those of you that have done it more than once.  In my case, compared to the insanity of **$Agency**, caring for my infant daughter had been a literal cakewalk, as if I'd taken a vacation.  Very little can display how stressful a job can be more than this - I should have taken this revelation more to heart, honestly.

Anyways, within a week of me coming back, I engineered a meeting with all my bosses (**$DragonLady**, **$MrScott**, and **$AwesomeBoss**) to determine what I'd need to do to advance myself at **$Agency**.  One thing was stacked pretty heavily against me - I did not have a Master's Degree or higher.  Because of this beauteous thing known as academic stratification, not having that degree would severely hamper my promotion changes (only those with higher degrees can enter the upper echelons/ivory towers of academia).  However, the meeting did have some promising results.  We talked about industry certifications.  **$MrScott** told me that if I was able to get one of the high-profile certs, this could be used in lieu of a higher degree when determining advancement.  I also let them know that I had a bunch of cartographic design ideas that I wanted to try out.  And I also planned on taking a ton of continuing education courses through the year.  It was my hope to have all this done by the time my contract renewal came up.  I left the meeting ready to jump right into it.  *Lock and load, baby!*

As an aside, at the same time as I had this meeting, I also requested some time off for a vacation during the summer.  It would be the first time we'd taken our little one anywhere.  I was honestly very excited about it.  Knowing how difficult it had been to secure time off in the past, I submitted this request about six months early.  Certainly that would be enough time, right?  \*nervous chuckle\*

From here, I got started on my career plan.  The most difficult thing to attain was the professional certification - it will remain unnamed, but that I think most *GIS Professionals* are aware of it ;)  This certification was a beast, but it was (and remains) probably the highest profile one in the industry.  Two parts gave me immense pause - an element called ""*Contributions to the Profession*,"" and the certification examination.

Let's talk about the contribution to the profession.  Whenever applying for this certification, you are required to obtain a number of ""credits"" worth of activities that serve to better the GIS field itself, such as volunteer work, service in GIS organizations, presentations, publications, mentoring other GIS professionals, etc.  Honestly, I think it's kind of a cool concept.  And for most folks involved in GIS, this usually shouldn't be too big of a deal.  For me, though, there was a major problem here.  Remember how I previously said that **$DragonLady** kept tight reins on our professional development?  This meant that none of the research that went out from **$Agency** had any of our names on them.  We couldn't make presentations at any industry events nor could we even attend them.  Around three quarters of possible types of contribution credits were unavailable to me.  Well... *sh\*t*.

Enter **$AwesomeRed**, once again in the clutch.  As it turned out, she was eyeing this particular certification too.  We decided to team up together to get all the contribution credits we needed (since it was proving exceptionally difficult to do so by ourselves).  At the time, **$AwesomeRed** happened to be participating in a particular *User Group* on campus.  The members were very interested in using GIS.  They loved hearing about tips and techniques from folks that actually worked in the profession.  So I started going to the meetings along with her.  Eventually, we decided that we'd host a workshop for the group, showing them some basic things about how to use GIS, where they could get spatial data, and fielding some general questions.  It would gain us some goodwill and give us huge points towards our contributions credits.  Everybody wins, right?

Unfortunately, *no*.

**$DragonLady** got wind of what we were doing.  She immediately called a meeting with the two of us.  She was very upset that we had done this without informing her.  Why?  What was going on?

Well, it turns out that the *User Group* organizer just so happened to have reached out to **$DragonLady** the previous year.  She wanted to see if **$Agency** could spare some of their GIS staff to give some demonstrations and presentations to the *User Group* \- basically exactly what we were planning to do.

***$DragonLady*** *had told her no.*

All of a sudden, two employees of **$DragonLady**'s agency just randomly showed up at the group's meetings and were willing to do exactly what the organizer had requested in the first place.  The organizer was puzzled and upset.  What the h\*ll?  Why hadn't **$DragonLady** provided this when first asked?  Well, **$DragonLady** was now very unhappy with us, since we'd ""undermined her authority"" and basically outright proven to the rest of campus that she wasn't willing to play nice with other people.  Y'know, if you don't act sh\*tty, you won't be surprised by someone bringing attention to your sh\*ttiness.

Anyways, we had already agreed to give this workshop.  We'd even written everything!  Eventually, **$DragonLady** conceded.  She said we could do this on the condition that the workshop was done ""under **$Agency**'s aegis"" and that she would be able to review our presentation materials beforehand.  In retrospect, we didn't need to agree to this at all.  This was something that we had agreed to do, on our own laurels and initiative.  However, I was still trying to get *PROMOTED* at **$Agency**, not fired, so I didn't say anything further about it.  I don't recall **$AwesomeRed** being particularly impressed with **$DragonLady** after this, however.  Oh, and also, even though we provided **$DragonLady** with our presentation materials, she never actually read them.  *Sounds about right*.

Anyways, we gave our workshop about a month later.  It went exceptionally well.  We were both able to use it as a contribution, and it gave me everything I needed for the certification!  Hooray! Unfortunately, due to the fallout between **$DragonLady** and the now-very-pissed-off leadership of the *User Group*, we were asked not to participate in it anymore.  Sucks, but what can you do :/

Now let's talk about the certification exam.  I'm sure that some GIS professionals might remember, but when the exam for this particular cert was first put in place, the folks that did so had a rather... *ridiculous* approach.  There may be a better way of saying this, but this seems apt.  There were no practice or study materials; the certification institute's official policy was ""everything we needed to know, we would have encountered through the course of our professional experience.""  How about I kick you in the nuts and then put that on the exam?  That's an experience.  Anyways, the only document they provided as a resource was a general concepts reference that was like 200 pages long and didn't go into detail on any particular point.  Jesus.

One thing they mentioned was of ""high importance"" on the exam was programming, software development, and general IT procedures.  As such, I started studying this stuff intensively.  Y'all, I had worked in GIS for about 8 years by that point.  I'd never heard of about 90% of the things mentioned in the IT sections of the general concepts document.  The first time I ever heard of the Agile and Waterfall methods was while studying for the presumably ""*GIS-based*"" exam.  I thought ""Tier 1"", ""Tier 2"", etc, referred to ground reference in cartographic design (i.e. ""Tier 1"" is what your eye is drawn to first, ""Tier 2"" is what your eye is drawn to second, etc).  Literally no offense to you proper tech support folks - I respect you all greatly, and if I didn't, I wouldn't take such delight in your stories and community here - but the IT and tech concepts incorporated into this exam were so far removed from what people actually use in GIS that it was literally laughable.  The delusions of a bunch of theoreticians that have so little connection to the day-to-day application of GIS that they don't realize how out-of-touch they are.

I studied for this stupid test for three months.  I studied the single resource I was given.  I reread textbooks from college.  I read a TON of IT publications, trying to learn terminology and usage.  Seriously, I learned more about IT and tech support studying for this GIS test than from anything else I'd ever done.  Thankfully, a bunch of angels here on Reddit (who had taken the exam already) put together some study guides with questions they'd been asked and concepts they saw on the test.  *If any of you are reading this now, I thank you from the bottom of my heart!*  After studying all that I could, I went to the testing center to take this exam.  It took about three hours, and when I finished, the lady running the examinations smiled at me and said that I had passed.  My jaw dropped.  This was it!  I had completed the certification!  *Woohoo!!!*

I got all my things together and prepared for my contract review to take place shortly after I passed the test.  I was so excited!  I'd done everything I promised.  I'd taken a ton of continuing education classes, I'd built my mapbook of a bunch of new cartographic techniques, and best yet, I'd gotten this incredibly difficult certification!  I was on cloud nine heading into the review.

Apparently this must have offended **$DragonLady** and **$MrScott**, as they proceeded to pull out the anti-aircraft guns during the meeting and shot me out of the sky.  After laying out all that I had done, they told me that it wasn't nearly enough to get a promotion or to be put into a leadership role.  The absolute worst thing said during the meeting came from **$MrScott**.  I'm not sure if this is exactly what was said, but the gist is as follows:

>**$MrScott**: You should not represent that you have any sort of expertise within GIS.  That sort of thing only comes with the proper academic credentials and peer recognition.  You simply haven't achieved that.  Without a higher level of degree, you should not expect to be placed in any sort of leadership position within **$Agency**.

Y'all... this was the most insulting, degrading thing that anyone has ever said to me in a professional context.  I wanted to yell at him, to punch him, to well up right there, but I held myself.  This crap, coming from a man that was two software suites behind the current technology being used in the profession?  That didn't seem capable of learning a new database architecture?  Who probably didn't know what 90% of the GIS functions I used on a daily basis actually did?  Just who the f\*ck *is* an expert to you?  *Because your stupid a$$ certainly isn't one!!!  GRAAH!*

I was so mad.  What made it worse was that I did everything I'd agreed to do in our meeting months ago, where I felt that I'd been promised an advancement in my career, yet absolutely nothing was going to be done.  And this wasn't all.  After some half-hearted pleasantries at the end of the meeting, **$DragonLady** passed over my new contract.  I had a 2% raise, the state-mandated minimum.  I was crushed.  I just sort of looked at it, nodded, folded it, and stood up to head out.  As I was walking out the door, **$DragonLady** called to me.

>**$DragonLady**: Oh, and one more thing.  I'm very sorry, but we've got a major process that needs to be run next week.  So I'm going to have to cancel your vacation as well.  My apologies but we need you here.

Remember the vacation I'd requested six months ago?  I was supposed to leave that Friday.  Three days away.  Why don't you just kick me in the face while I'm down?  *AAAAAAAAAAAHHHH!!!!!*

I went back to my office and slumped down at my computer, more upset than I could remember being in recent memory.  I had to send a text to my wife to let her know that I would only be able to make it to our vacation on the two bookend weekends.  I took a few minutes to compose myself, then logged back into my computer.

And immediately started looking for another job.

Let me just say that I was terrified as I began this.  I didn't know what **$DragonLady** would do if she found out I was looking for something else - would she just have me walked out?  Dealing with her when she was upset was a nightmare, after all.  And honestly there were other things - all kinds of uncertainties flooded my head.  What if there wasn't something available that would give me a reasonable income, at or above what I was getting paid right now?  What if the things that **$MrScott** had said in the meeting were right - that I really wasn't an expert in this field, that I just didn't have what it took to be a decent GIS analyst, that I wouldn't be able to make it anywhere else?  I'll admit that while I did my best to remain confident, I was very unsure of myself as I started down this uncertain road.  But I was so tired of getting kicked in the teeth.  It was enough to summon my courage to try.

I quickly found a couple of things that looked promising, however.  I updated my resume and reached out to some old supervisors to make sure they'd give me a good reference (including **$FTW**).  After about a week, I approached **$AwesomeBoss** as well.  I told her that I was looking for something new.  She understood.  I asked her if she'd mind if I listed her as my supervisor and a reference, and she said that would be fine.  She also told me that she would recommend I told **$DragonLady** that I was looking for something new - if I was honest with her, it was possible that **$DragonLady** would assist (or would at least not get super-angry for me not telling her).  I honestly trusted **$AwesomeBoss** so I told her I'd think about it.  However, I also feel like this was something that was specific to my own circumstances - and I do not recommend doing this for most other folks out there.

A week later, I requested a meeting with **$DragonLady**.  In that meeting, I told her that I was looking for a new job.  She said that she had seen ""a change in my demeanor"" and expected as much.  She made a couple of comments to try and keep me here - mostly fear-based stuff, which was kind of awful in retrospect.  She told me that I'd increased my income here fairly rapidly and that I couldn't expect that at another place.  She also said that positions in the public system were limited by pay bands, and I couldn't expect something much beyond what I was getting already.  I said fine.  Eventually, she gave up.  I said I'd be in contact with her if anything changed.

Over the course of the following week, I had three interviews.  Two of them I was able to do on my lunch breaks; the other I needed some time off, so **$AwesomeBoss** let me go and covered for me.  Each of the three gave me an offer :D

The last interview was at a local municipality.  They didn't have any real GIS capabilities at the time and they were looking to build some.  I liked the bosses - they seemed like very chill, down-to-earth people.  Very easy to work for and work with.  But the best thing was the pay.  I told them going into the meeting that I wanted a pay rate higher than what they were offering.  They were ok with that and we went through the interview.  The next day, the HR Director from the municipality called me.  They met *all my pay demands* and she offered me the job!  I tried to keep my voice in check, but I was pretty much jumping up and down in joy while I took that call!

Honestly, this was such a validation of my skills, everyone.  I had managed to get three offers - not interviews, *offers* \- within a *month* of my job search!  All of them provided higher rates of pay.  I was able to pick and choose the job that I wanted, not take whatever was available.  I don't think anything could have been a bigger middle finger to the attitudes that **$MrScott** and **$DragonLady** had than this.  I told all three offers to let me wait until the following Friday to decide.  I spoke to my wife; we liked the municipality the best.  The first thing I did when I got to ""work"" that Friday was call the HR Director at the municipality and accept the job.  I told her that I wanted a month's notice to wrap up things here.  She said that would be fine.

I then printed out my letter of resignation and the offer letter I'd been given.  I stopped by both **$AwesomeBoss** and **$AwesomeRed** on the way to **$DragonLady**'s office to let them know; both of them hugged me.  I then walked into **$DragonLady**'s office and said I needed to speak with her as it was very important.  She stopped what she was doing and turned to me with a rather incredulous look - remember, this was only a little more than a week after I'd told her I was looking for something new, and less than a month after I started looking altogether.  I laid the paperwork on table.  She sat there and looked at it for a couple of moments.

When she looked up, she gave me a counter-offer, saying she'd been putting the paperwork together to get me another pay adjustment based on my new credentials.  The new offer was less than I'd be making at the municipality - I would have said no just based on that.  But instead, what I said to her was this:

>**$Me**: I would have accepted this if you'd have offered it to me when I had my performance review last month.  Sorry.

She gave me a wry smile, then said, ""Well then, I guess that's it.""

We then got everything ready for me to leave.  I had requested a month's notice since I was so heavily involved in so many things, but because I had so much leave time stored up, **$DragonLady** wanted me to use some of it before I left.  I actually only worked about two more weeks (then had a two week vacation :D ).  And I still had two months of leave paid out to me once I quit.  In my final days there, I wrote down all of the processes I could think of, spoke to all my colleagues and coworkers to make sure they understood them, and gave them a contact number in case they couldn't figure everything out.  Two days before my last day, they held a party for me - ironically, at the same restaurant that **$BadMike** had his going-away farce.  I had made a ton of friends at **$Agency**, many of whom I still keep in contact with today, so it was very bittersweet.  Lots of hugs and the manliest tears ever shed :)  I told all my coworkers that I would miss them - *because I actually would* \- and made sure to spend some time with **$AwesomeRed**, **$AwesomeBoss**, and many of my other colleagues to let them know how much they meant to me.

Despite all the chaos, **$Agency** had been such a profound part of my life.  During my tenure, I had gotten engaged and then married, bought a house, and become a father.  I had learned all the foundational things I'd need for my career and achieved the highest certification in the industry.  I had also slept on a sleeping bag in my office, worked through the night numerous times, been on the verge of tears due to frustration, and dealt with incompetence, laziness, and stupidity the likes of which I had never thought could exist.  This job had proven to be simultaneously the best and worst experience of my life.

On my last day, I brought my daughter with me.  We said our final goodbyes to everyone.  I cleaned out my office.  I logged out of my computer and turned everything in.  At the end of the day, I told my daughter, ""Say goodbye to **$Agency**, sweetheart.""  She cooed and grabbed my finger.

And then I walked out of those doors for the last time, to my next great adventure.

:)

I hope you all have enjoyed these stories.  And you may be wondering what happened at **$Agency** after I departed.  Well, I still have one last tale - an epilogue for you.  But that will have to wait until tomorrow :)  Thanks for reading, everyone!

186,"Here is the file I converted to MP3. Morgan Freeman: ""They did not in fact convert it to MP3.""","I have worked in the Creative Services department at a large law firm for over 20 years now.

U Matic tape, I have a deck in the back.

Friday, Word Processing says they received some large MP3 files from outside the firm that will not load into their dictation software.

187,Why do ISPs have to be so bad at their jobs?,"So, I’m the person who takes care of most of the tech things at my small-town church. Sometime mid-late last year we decided to upgrade our network, as we weren’t going to stop streaming our services anytime soon, and the old setup was pretty trash (Spectrum-provided modem/router/WiFi combo thing in the office and a secondary home WiFi router in the tech booth acting as a access point and switch). 

In late December, we finally pulled the trigger and did the network upgrades. Me and the trustee who’s name is on the internet plan spent most of an afternoon running Ethernet and installing and configuring the new system that I designed, made up of Aruba Instant On switches and access points and a Protectli Vault running pfSense as our central router/firewall. During this process we had to go through a bunch of customer support misery to get them to put the modem/WiFi router into bridge mode so it was just a modem. 

A week or so ago, the aforementioned trustee and I decided to upgrade our internet service package to the next level up, mostly so that we had reasonable bandwidth headroom for our livestream. This involved Spectrum coming to replace the modem, which happened while I was at my day job. When I was checking it out this morning, I found that Spectrum had put one of their own WiFi routers in between the new modem and our pfSense router, rendering our whole network double NATed because they apparently weren’t aware that we didn’t need routing or WiFi from them. 

I really hate dealing with ISPs.",119,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF1C4AF0>
188,At this point the universe is just screwing with me...,"**UPDATE:** Well, I think I have an idea of what it is. 

The ATX 12V specification requires that the PS-ON connector in the 24-pin plug has a voltage that's slightly higher than 0.8V. When you engage PS-ON, it increases the resistance in the wire and drops the voltage, turning the power supply on. 

What I think the issue might be is that the PS-ON resistance is too high to kick the motherboard on, and the problem is related to how it grounds with the case and/or the PSU when not in a case. And the only thing I can think of that causes that kind of damage is a power surge. 

The way it works is that if the resistance drops from high to low (closing the circuit briefly), the PSU turns on and powers up the rest of the system. In reverse, activating the switch and closing the circuit again, resistance jumps up and the power supply shuts off if that resistance is maintained. 

It makes sense too. If there's too much resistance the system won't turn on and I'll get the intermittent behaviour depending on whether the board has been completely drained or if there's still a charge in the capacitors. 

Probing with a multimeter will confirm the diagnosis. In any case, the motherboard will need replacing.

--------------------------------------------------------- 

First post here, been lurking for years. I'm a qualified network engineer. I've worked in the IT industry for over a decade, twice in desktop/server technician roles, on-call support, hardware journalism, yadda yadda. 

I need to vent. 

I'm not stumped. I know there's an issue with the motherboard in the computer that I'm currently fixing. But for the love of all that is holy, this thing is possessed with an attitude that could be described as ""aggressively childish"". 

I built a computer for a customer. It's a low-end system with an Athlon 200GE, 8GB DDR4, 240GB M.2 SSD, etc. It only does productivity tasks and Stardew Valley. This customer is perfectly capable of using technology and she always calls me first before moving the system, swapping cables, or when there's something funky. I curated my customers such that none of them are problem children. 

Out of the blue, she calls and tells me the computer won't switch on. I get there and sure enough, it doesn't turn on. It's not a cabling issue, there's power to the wall, the power switch is known to be good. 

I take it back and test it myself, and it still won't turn on. I unplug things and disconnect hardware and remove the other DIMM. It still doesn't turn on. I take the board and power supply out of the case and test it on a box, and it turns on. 

Back in the case, problem. Out the case, no problem. I tested with another case and I verified that the board won't turn on when it's inside any of the cases I tested. The case itself passes inspection for possible shorts and a faulty switch - nothing, nada, zilch.  

So I RMA the board and tell the supplier that it might work outside the case, but that there appears to be a problem when it's inside a chassis. They agree to test it for me. Wouldn't you know it, the bastard works just fine in all scenarios, even extended benchmarking and long periods of being idle or in sleep mode inside a case, on a test bench, and the motherboard box. 

I got the board back on Saturday and put the CPU and RAM in. Hooked up a known good PSU. It doesn't start. I did several component swaps to check what the cause could be, but nothing worked. 

Just an hour ago I assembled the system to take it to a computer shop for a second opinion, because there's clearly something wrong with the setup but I can't pinpoint it. I know what the symptoms are, but the cause eludes me. Always get a second pair of eyes on a problem when you can't figure it out.

The stupid thing starts up on the first try after putting it back into the original chassis. 

Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk titled ""I hate computers and printers"". We'll probably replace the motherboard.",34,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF1C4B50>
189,The Agency: Part 6 - The Ballad of the Bosses,"Hello everyone!  This is the next story in the saga of my time at **$Agency**, wherein we find out that there are still more issues despite the dismissal of **$BadMike**.  All of this is from the best of my memory along with some personal records, but ultimately it is how I remember things.  There certainly can be some inaccuracies.  Also, I don't give permission for anyone else to use this.

TL/DR: Yeah, I don't do that.  Enjoy the story :)

Again, for context, I am not in IT; rather, I'm a GIS (Geographic Information Systems) professional.  This particular world is quite small, so I will do what I can to properly anonymize my tale.  For reference, during the course of these stories I was employed at a research agency affiliated with a major university.  Here is my Dramatis Personae:

* **$Me**: I wonder who this could be!
* **$Agency**: Research agency where I was working at the time.
* **$MrScott**: Very nice guy, very smart, and completely clueless as a manager.  Sort of my superior at this point.
* **$DragonLady**: The director of $Agency.  Brilliant, great fundraiser, and similarly terrible at managing people.
* **$AwesomeBoss**: Operations manager.  Very awesome, very chill and approachable yet extremely competent.
* **$AwesomeRed**: Very awesome and intelligent analyst.  She was my best friend in the office.
* **$GoodMike**: New GIS staff member that happened to have the same name as $BadMike.  A superior Mike in every way.
* **$GoldPhD**: Very intelligent and awesome staff member (but not a member of the GIS team).  She had some major issues with $DragonLady.

When we last left off, I had just achieved my first true victory.  I had vanquished my nemesis, **$BadMike**, and helped to engineer his dismissal.  The nightmare was over.  From this point forward, we'd be able move forward with our work in a drastically improved way.  The worst was past - we had won, hadn't we?  Everything would be ok going forward, right?

Unfortunately, no.  Very, very no.

With **$BadMike** no longer employed at **$Agency**, we started to see that there were a ton of other problems with the way the organization was being run.  Most of these issues had been veiled by **$BadMike**'s awfulness.  To be sure, **$BadMike** sucked, and he really was responsible for the majority of the bullsh\*t we had to deal with, but with him now out of the way we could tell that there was just as much to deal with between **$MrScott** and **$DragonLady**.  What I've got below is less a transcription of what occurred in the immediate aftermath of **$BadMike**'s firing; rather, it is more a laundry list of the crap we'd been dealing with for years by that point.  What is important to know is that these problems now began to permeate every facet of our work lives.

We'll start with **$MrScott**.

As can be inferred from his name, **$MrScott** was a terrible manager.  He was only placed in his position because he had been working at **$Agency** for over 20 years.  Management by seniority, nothing else.  He was a great researcher and actually very good at the GIS work that he did.  And he was honestly a nice person outside the professional environment.  I still have books that he gave to me.  However, as a manager and a leader, he was awful.  If you were to take a list of all the traits that can be exhibited by a bad manager, he probably ticked almost every box.

For example, he was patently incapable of taking responsibility.  If one of us had an error or problem, then that was *OUR* error or problem.  We needed to fix it, to ensure we didn't do that next time, and we would be held accountable in every instance.  Nothing could convince him that he held any share of the blame.  Similarly, if **$MrScott** had an error or problem, that was *ALSO* our error or problem - because, after all, we worked for him, so we should have informed him if we knew there would be any issues.  He refused to make decisions, telling us to go speak to **$AwesomeBoss** (who was usually out of the loop) or **$DragonLady** (who was usually too busy to see us).  When we would ask if we were finished with a particular project, he would never, ever let us know.  We probably kept 90% of our projects technically ""open"" because nobody would tell us when we were through!  Ugh.

He took great pride in the educational position he held in the academic hierarchy, as well.  Dude, the ego that exudes from academia is more noxious than a landfill.  As I said in previous posts, he refused to use the GIS system architecture that we created simply because he didn't want to learn it; it was, essentially, ""beneath"" him.  He rarely even used the current GIS software suite that the rest of us were using at the time, preferring to go with one that had been in use in the late 90s!  Again, this was because he didn't want to learn how to use it.  He would often say things that were extremely dismissive to the rest of us - not because he was *explicitly* trying to be mean, but because he simply couldn't comprehend that talent and expertise can exist without a piece of paper from an academic institution.  He would often state that we ""shouldn't go around telling people that we understood what we were doing"" because we weren't working towards/had a PhD or anything similar.  The very essence of the moronic douchebag that says ""*using Google doesn't make you a doctor*.""  I am 100% certain that you proper IT folks would have slapped the sh\*t out of him on a daily basis.

Many of the things that he did were just bizarre.  There was one instance in particular that I remember vividly.  Do you all remember the Beach Games episode of The Office?  During that episode, Michael Scott (the boss) asks Pam (the receptionist) to take notes of everything happening through the day while he awards things to the staff.  Towards the end of the day, he asks Pam if she's been keeping score and who is in the lead.  Pam doesn't know, as Michael has been giving them random awards.  Michael then asks Pam to look through her notebook to see if there's a conversion chart - clearly something that he would have had to tell her about so she could have written it down!

Incredibly, I had an experience just like this with **$MrScott**.  At one point, he performed some sort of analysis that used some data he'd saved to his own computer (instead of to the network, go figure).  He hadn't recorded the steps he'd taken when doing this, and when it wound up going to final product, there were a bunch of issues and he got chewed out.  He knew that I kept a notebook on my desk where I recorded notes to put into our documentation later.  After this particular fiasco, he called me into his office, asking me to bring my notebook.  When we started talking, he asked if I had any notes on what *HE'D* done in *MY* notebook.  I just stared at him - *WTF?*  He asked if I'd taken any notes on a process he had not told me about, that he'd saved entirely to his own system, that I had no access to, and that he'd never involved anyone else in?!  *Is this... is this a thing?!?*  What kind of moron asks this?!?  He then proceeded to have me to look through my notebook for anything that might have been relevant!  I was literally floored by this - it broke my mind that a mental deficiency of this sort could even exist.  I should have pulled out my pen right there and written ""*You are f\*cking stupid*"" in my notebook and called it a ""relevant note.""  Alas, I wanted to keep my job.

There were plenty of other problems, too.  He wouldn't communicate on virtually anything, so if you told him something it would fall on deaf ears.  If you went to him with a problem, he'd either deflect it onto someone else or just not do anything about it.  Eventually, though, we determined that if you just didn't talk to him, he wouldn't come to you with anything.  He honestly seemed content to stay cloistered in his office.  Later on at **$Agency**, we'd just speak to **$AwesomeBoss** for pretty much everything.  **$MrScott** would only be involved if someone specifically demanded it.  Unfortunately, in these instances he also wanted to make sure he suitably marked his territory, and instead of peeing all over everything he'd invariably put some obsolete procedure or random bullsh\*t into the project to prove his involvement.  Peeing on things would have been far easier for us to deal with.  Usually, we'd just ignore what he said because he'd never follow up later.  Still, it got to the point where we'd collectively groan if we heard that **$MrScott** was going to be part of anything.

Eventually, though, he was so sidelined from our active operations that he was largely a non-entity (except when he wanted to slam his foot in the door).

Let's move on to **$DragonLady**.

There were a lot of things to like about **$DragonLady**.  She was incredibly smart, and even better, was exceptionally creative.  She was very good at getting support from a number of places.  We never had an issue with funding, something that isn't so easy do to when you are in research.  Remember that she gave me a big raise and moved me into my own office.  And she helped defend me against the accusations of **$TheLawyer**.  In a lot of cases, she was very understanding, and she could be very nice from time to time.

But there were a ton of things about her that were just awful (and remain so to this day).  And the bad greatly outweighed the good.  Buckle up, cause we're in for a ride.

One of the worst things was how much she micromanaged.  Every one of you already knows this is a terrible trait.  She wanted to be involved in every decision, every design, every procedure that we did.  Never mind if it was some sort of internal GIS process.  Never mind if she literally had no idea what it did.  She had to know when we were updating data and how.  She had to be able to weigh in on our symbology choices and map designs.  There was no such thing as ""*general guidance*"" - she had to be consulted for almost every decision we made as a team.  She seemed incapable of delegation.  As you can understand, this got real old, real quick, particularly once we started ramping up the volume of work.  At one point, she demanded that I send her an email with every single decision I made during the day and everything she needed to follow up on.  So I did.  After flooding her inbox for about two weeks, she demanded that I change this to ""*only the information she needed to know about*.""  So I stopped sending the emails altogether (see what I did there? :D ).  She never said another word to me about it.

We had one staff member we hired that I'll call **$GoodMike**.  He was phenomenal at the coding, scripting, and querying aspects of GIS.  He crafted a ton of incredibly useful scripts for us.  However, these were SCRIPTS, folks - all of you IT professionals know that coding takes time, requires specific parameters, and is crafted for a particular goal or use.  It is only as flexible as its design, and adding more flexibility takes magnitudes more time and effort.  **$DragonLady** couldn't comprehend that scripting needed to be maintained and was not a one-size-fits-all solution, especially in a research setting.  She didn't understand that code gets screwed up by changes in parameters and data.  Consequently, when these scripts were used for purposes for which they weren't designed, they failed.  As a result, she thought **$GoodMike** was an idiot.  And she decreed that no scripts could be used unless she checked and confirmed them first.  By her - *who had no coding skills whatsoever*.  *WHAT?!*  Pretty sure you IT folks' heads would explode.  Yeah, so we wound up using those scripts without telling her and troubleshot them as we could.

She was completely erratic in her project management approach, as if she couldn't focus on anything for more than a few minutes.  *This sucked so much*.  We'd get to the end of a project and be presenting the final version, and she'd wind up having half a million edits for us *in the rollout!*  We'd get new projects right in the middle of old ones, be told to abandon things ""for the time being,"" and then shift gears.  Usually, what we stopped working on would be abandoned for good.  We'd get in to the office and see emails she sent at 3 AM giving us a new directive to work on, and she'd complain at 8-9 AM that we hadn't formulated a plan of attack yet.  Turnarounds of 1 hour were not uncommon.  It was mentally exhausting having to shift work focus so d\*mned much.  Honestly, the constant disruption in our workflow probably cost us more productivity than any other single thing at **$Agency**.

She also seemed incredibly paranoid about letting us have time off.  This was awful.  It was as if she didn't think that **$Agency** would survive if one of us was not at work.  And this may have actually been the case due to how chaotic she was in her project assignments.  If a particular person was needed to fulfill a ""spark of inspiration"" she had off the cuff, and this person wasn't available, then her random project idea couldn't get completed.  As a result, getting time off was like pulling teeth - h\*ll, it was like ripping vertebrae out of your back.  We would request time off months in advance only to have it denied the day before we were to be off.  Have an industry event you want to attend?  Nope.  Have a family gathering you'd like to go to?  Nope.  Need to go to a doctor's appointment?  *NOPE*.  Jesus.

There was one incident I remember very well.  We had hired someone I'll call **$GoldPhD**.  She held a doctorate in her field, had years of experience, and was one of the premier researchers in the discipline.  We were incredibly lucky to even have her at **$Agency**.  After working here for about two years, she decided to take a two-week vacation.  She had the time accrued, let **$DragonLady** know around a month in advance, and went ahead and paid for everything.  I think she and her husband were going on a cruise.  Around a week before she was to depart, **$DragonLady** came back and denied her vacation.  The reason?  ""I cannot simply let you take this amount of time off when you have responsibilities here at **$Agency**.""  The screaming match afterwards was of epic proportions.  **$GoldPhD** quit on the spot, forced **$DragonLady** to pay out all her accrued leave, *still* went on her vacation, and had another job with a competing agency at the university the *SAME F\*CKING DAY*. \*slowest of claps\*

Another problem was **$DragonLady**'s abject refusal to share credit on anything.  Not a single paper or report had an analyst's name on it.  It was as if she treated all the staff at **$Agency** as her own personal students.  This extended even to professional events.  She would invariably refuse to allow us time off to attend anything within the industry, stating that in anything we did, ""we were representing **$Agency** and she needed to be in charge of cultivating that perception.""  As you can imagine, this is absolute bullsh\*t.  If we ever attend a professional event (especially on our own resources), we are representing *OURSELVES*, not who we work for.  She would get incredibly angry if we even communicated with other GIS colleagues, admonishing us not to do that.  After all, this meant that she wouldn't have complete control over our career development.  As you can imagine, this generated an *immense* amount of resentment among the GIS staff.  We *NEEDED* to keep on top of technology and industry changes.  She seemed incapable of recognizing that we were not her graduate students - we were *PROFESSIONALS*, and we expected to be treated as such.

But probably her worst sin was how f\*cking vague she was.  She was a researcher and a professor, and invariably seemed to think that we should be ""exploring the questions"" rather than taking orders.  The problem is - *that's not how professional project management works*.  In many cases, it was as if we had to read her mind to figure out what we were supposed to f\*cking do in the first place!  I remember one specific instance where we were discussing a project, and I brought up a question about a particular directive she had demanded.  I asked her what it meant - her response was ""What do you think it means?""  At the time, I responded with my best guess (which was invariably wrong, how surprising).  But if I was in the same position today, without a second's hesitation my answer would be ""I should never have to guess what my responsibilities are.  Either tell me or don't expect anything.""  This crap irritated us all, but I remember **$AwesomeBoss** being particularly infuriated by it.

Christ, this was so frustrating.  And it eventually broke **$GoodMike**.  He was much like many of you, I'd expect.  He was used to reasonably clear instructions, a development methodology, and a systematic approach.  He was used to iterations, troubleshooting, and refinement.  **$DragonLady**'s chaos was simply impossible for him to adapt to.  After only a few months at **$Agency**, he was actually demoted since **$DragonLady** couldn't comprehend how useful he could be and had no idea how to leverage his skills within our team.  Eventually, thankfully, he found employment elsewhere - at a company that has a much better and more mature management style.  As you can imagine, he is thriving there :)

There are honestly more things I could think about, but I'm getting sick of listing it all.  Just know that as a manager, **$DragonLady** had a lot of severe problems, ones that I feel really hampered our ability to be a world-class GIS team.  As for the name **$DragonLady** \- I didn't make that up.  That is her nickname at the state departments that have to deal with her.  I'm sure she would be *thrilled* to know that, lol.  When she doesn't get her way, she can be a nightmare.

It's ok, Moss, you can swear if you want to.  *PLOPPERS!*

Man, I need a beer.  I'll be right back.

And I'm back.  As can be seen, there were a ton of structural issues plaguing **$Agency**.  At the time, I continued to roll with it.  But something was about to happen that was going to change my life forever.  In early spring, roughly a year after **$BadMike** had been let go, my wife came into our bedroom holding a pregnancy test.  She had a look that was equal parts excitement and terror in her eyes.  She blurted out, ""I'm pregnant!"", squealed, and threw herself nervously on the bed.

I was going to be a father.

I did everything I could to get ready for it.  I didn't tell **$DragonLady** until I could be 100% sure, though I did let **$AwesomeBoss** know (as I liked her and trusted her).  Since we pretty much couldn't take time off, even for doctor's appointments, I made sure to ""call in sick"" on each of my wife's gynecology appointments.  Y'all, I nearly fainted when I saw my little one's heartbeat for the first time!After each appointment, I called **$AwesomeBoss** to let her know what we'd found out, and she was so thrilled for us each time :)

Eventually, after a few months, we made the announcement.  I told **$DragonLady** that I'd be taking five weeks off for paternity leave.  She was remarkably ok with it.  I would expect the FMLA regulations that I informed her of played no part in that >:D  Anyways, we got to the end of the year and I started my leave so that I could be with my wife whenever she went into labor.  In the delivery room, I was a little shell-shocked to see my daughter for the first time - I remember the nurse gave me my wife's phone and said, ""You'd better take a picture or she's gonna kill you!""  I nervously responded with *yes ma'am* :)  Once things had settled down, I sent the pictures on to **$AwesomeBoss**.  She texted me back shortly thereafter saying that every one of the ladies in the office were huddled around her phone, trying to get a peek at the new addition to our family!

That night, as I held my sweet little girl in my arms for the first time, I swore that I would do everything in my power to advance my career and provide for her as best as I could :\*)  I would work tirelessly to ensure that she could have a decent life and that I would be able to be part of it.  And I would get started the moment I returned to work.

Tomorrow, you all will see how that panned out.  Thanks for reading, everyone :)

190,"Why I'm on paid leave over a $5.00 flash drive, with nothing of value on it, getting smashed","Some back information, I work for a corporation and or institution where users handle enough information to be able to commit at least 2-3 felonies for every little query they touch (which isn't THAT hard to imagine), as such they have a lot of policies that seem like extreme overkill, But on some level I agree with the attempt, the actual application of the rules I think borders on insanity but the attempts aren't all complete failures.

&#x200B;

So some info you need to know, there's an ""internal"" USB connector inside the case. All the ""external"" USB ports have physical blocks super glued in. This is another story i've already posted.

&#x200B;

So, Friday morning 8:00 am I'm sitting around waiting for a ticket/something to do.  I get a call in that a computer can't login. There's no ticket because.. well they can't log in to start a ticket. Entirely understandable. The computer is network login, so there's 1000 different things it can be. Heck it could just be unplugged and not turning on. Y'al know how users can be.

  
I head up to their cubicle and start checking, everything is plugged in, the computer turns on and  there's no internet. I switch her network cord with her neighbhors to check the cord/everything upstream, her neighbors computer connects with her jack. I log into the local admin account and there's no internet connection or network connection at  all. Check device manager and there's the problem. The driver for the onboard network got corrupted *or  something*, can't roll it back either.

&#x200B;

Great, this means I need authorization from cyber security to use a flash drive, and then I'll need to tear the computer apart to get to a USB port that is hidden inside the case that isn't superglued. Now the key for the case requires my supervisor to sign off on it and give me the key for the case lock, as well I have to write up the ticket and put it into the system.

&#x200B;

I run down to the bat cave and download the driver for her computer and  email it to my boss, with a note to stick it on a thumb drive. And then walk to his desk.

&#x200B;

""Hey boss I emailed you a network driver I need on a thumb drive, I also need you to submit my authorization form to cyber Sec for the use of a portable storage device"" (yes that really is two forms)

&#x200B;

So we sent the form off to cyber security to authorize.

request for USB  storage device usage,

Time estimated on the work: 15 minutes

reason: copying network drivers to get the computer back on the network

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Half an hour later, no response. Head of IT calls down to cyber security to get an  ETA.

&#x200B;

10 minutes later the request comes back as denied. 

&#x200B;

Reason : Just email the file

&#x200B;

So we got the biggest Idiot ever reviewing the request... she has a tendency to just completely drop the ball, before they took the job in Cyber security she had neither experience in Cyber security, nor any basic understanding of IT. But it's OK, she can haphazardly enforce rules she doesn't understand and she spends her day helping idiots reset their passwords using the password reset tool.

&#x200B;

So my boss has to call her and explain the situation. After half 5 minutes on the phone he has to go upstairs to the boss of cyber security and explain why she's an idiot today.

&#x200B;

Half an hour later the approval comes from cybersecurity comes in to my email and my boss texts me to grab the form from him, and his spare keys and USB drive.

&#x200B;

So Now I have ***both*** authorization forms and I return to the woman's desk. She left a note for me that she's making a starbucks run and will be back.

&#x200B;

So I power down her computer and turn it on it's side so I can get it open to plug the USB in. I'm standing there fiddling with the flash drive and someone yanks it out of my hand tosses it to the floor and he starts stomping on it.

&#x200B;

""What the hell are you doing?""

""USB devices are banned"" he replied.

&#x200B;

""WHOAH WHOAH.. first of all I have an authorization form from cyber security.. Second of all that's company property, and third of all, you just destroyed evidence"" I tell the idiot. So I call my boss and he's still in cyber securities office, or water cooler/breakroom as I explain what went down.

  
Cyber security overhears this exchange. Cyber security decides to open a file on mishandling of suspect data. AKA smashing evidence.

&#x200B;

Around about 11:00 am my boss comes back to the users desk with a different flash drive and the drivers for the network adapter and another stack of new forms for him to do the work.

&#x200B;

I spent an hour with cyber security filing out paper work about the destruction of a $5.00 flash drive, giving my statement on the data mishandling, and my statement responding to the accusation of using a USB storage device.

&#x200B;

So it took  3 hours and 15 minutes of 2 techs time (including the head of IT) to reinstall *a* ***network driver***.

&#x200B;

And now they have to pay a data recovery specialist god only knows how much to try to recover nothing of any value on a $5.00 flash drive, to prove there was nothing malicious on it.

&#x200B;

Oh and I'm on paid leave because they don't know **for certain** what's on the flash drive. Cyber security told me that as long as data recovery finds what I said is on it, or can't find anything, that i'm in the clear.  If the drive hadn't been smashed cyber security could/would have just looked at the USB drive and looked at what is on the drive. Should have taken like 8 seconds to do.

&#x200B;

Instead I can collect pay checks until the data recovery experts take a few cracks at the USB drive.

&#x200B;

But the good news is that I got to go home early on a Friday

&#x200B;

Also I get a long weekend... maybe I'll binge watch Stargate.",709,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF1C4C10>
191,"Momma calling - Son, your picture is showing up for every contact on my phone, and it's that goofy one where you're smiling weird","Everyone's mom's will eventually call them for tech support, even if it's not your field.

I'm not exactly an Android tech support person, **but when it's your mother...**

So my Mom has the worst habit of throwing around jargon and meaningless details when asking for assistance. But she's my Mom, so I've got to usually hear the long version of her tech support nightmares. Well, this time I short-circuited some of it. But the pertinent details are that my contact photo had mysteriously replaced literally everyone's contact picture of those contacts still on her phone. However, the vast majority of contacts, including yours truly, had vanished. So she asked a friend or relative what my number was, just to place this frantic tech support call to the only one willing and able to fix her phone. Me. Like 4 days after trouble started.

Reversing course a little, I had repeatedly told her last fall to buy a new phone when they went on sale for Christmas ... and she hadn't. Told her to get the cheapest Samsng A model. Didn't happen. I think hers is running Android 7 and it's always filling up its memory. She also moved away so I can't do this in person.

One little tidbit had gotten me on track with solving this disaster, and that was that she claimed that her phone did a ""massive reset.""

*Son, I've got a massive problem here.*

*I've lost the normal stuff to get online to my bank...*

*Google did a massive reset on my phone.*

*Your face is on everything new that is on my phone, and when I'm calling someone, it's your face.*

*You are the domain administrator for my phone* (which is correct) ...

*I tried to talk to Vzn, and I don't know how I can get into my bank, and I don't know my user name, and the closest bank to me is ... blah, etc., I've got a major situation... I've got only 8 or 9 numbers for anybody, and John called me so I have his contact now, and so I don't know anybody's number and I've been, ah, I can't login to my bank because I don't know my user name...*

**(There's about 3 to 5 minutes of this mess that's happened due to the ""massive reset"") (Too long, didn't listen.)**

Well, while my Mom broadcasted to an empty phone, I hurriedly googled ""google massive reset"" to see if she had gotten into some kind of phishing email or app. I couldn't figure out if she had done a soft/hard reset, or what she got herself into, to be honest. That would be for further investigation later. So after some figuring ... out popped a possible solution to her mess ... having the volume turned down helped.

1. I determined that her main Google account was no longer linked to her phone ... an old domain account that I still maintained for friends and family and is grandfathered in to Google G Suite (now Workspace).
2. Her problems were probably due to a reset or deleting her domain account, and some combination of Vzn Cloud/Google Accounts/SIM Card contacts had been corrupted or destroyed or were simply not being copied amongst themselves.

My plan of attack was:

1. Get logged into my Google domain admin screen, and look to see if her domain account was disabled or needed a password reset, and prepare to do that and all the ramifications of that.
2. Walk her through adding back her MOM\_ att \_example\_net Google account to this Android phone, which almost certainly had all of her contacts stored.

Part 1: easy. Part 2, which I listed second but was the first thing I needed to do, well, this **is** my Mom.

""Ok, Mom, that is way too much information in order to fix your phone... I need you to go into settings...""

She had apparently been practicing a lot in phone settings, because it only took about 2 minutes to get her into the ""Add Google account"" screen, working blind because her OS was much older than mine and going from memory from 2018 or whatever. I got her to login, and amazingly, her password worked and she actually knew it. I didn't even have to do Step 1. I was <5 minutes in on the fix, and it was fixed.

But she was underwhelmed because it wasn't an immediate fix. Because ... remember this? Google can't do its thing without WiFi. Her phone told her that it needed to download 1.1 GB of data, and it won't do that until it has WiFi.

The next 10 minutes are repeatedly informing her that she had to actually go do that.

""Mom, you'll have to go to Wal-Cart or McRonalds or someplace and shop for an hour or something while it updates... No, you have to get WiFi... Well, no they have WiFi at your friend's place, but you'll have to ask for their WiFi password...""

*Well, ok, say hi to the wife and kids, I've got to go. Hey, your face is changing to someone else... I think it's starting to work... Hopefully I can get into my bank...*

""Mom, you have to go connect to WiFi."" (clik)

I heard back from my teenager a few days later that ""everything came back and it's working again and thanks.""

Pretty sure that was the short version. Hopefully my goofy photo is no longer the contact picture for her doctor, bank, and best friend. It *is* pretty weird. I put it there as a joke before she left, so maybe it's payback. But it's very therapeutic to think that my duck face was on every contact on her phone.",33,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF1C4C70>
192,"yes, loud screeching sounds probably indicate a problem","In my very, very, very first tech support job, I was mostly a gopher for a couple of senior CE/FE guy at a computer company, back in the 80s.  We shared office space with a company that manufactured peripherals for us, and they had some fairly old mainframe systems, some we had to support and some we didn't.   One system had two old 80Mb (no, that's not a typo) disk drives, each one the size of a shopping cart.   These were interesting in that the covers for the bay that held the removable disk pack were clear plastic.   So you could watch the platters spinning around and the head assembly moving in and out.   

One Saturday I was at home and my phone rings (only landlines in those days).   Its one of the programmers and he's at the office.   He's shouting to me over the phone since there's a terrible screeching sound in the background.   He tells me he's in the computer room and one of the disk drives is making the sound I'm hearing.  He wants to know if he should shut it off.  

I've only worked for the company a couple of months and don't really know that much these disk drives but I know enough to know that this sound indicates a Major Problem.  So I tell him, sure, turn it off.  He puts the phone down to walk over the machine and I listen to the screeching.   Then I hear the sound slowly wind down and stop.   Guy comes back to the phone and says something like, ""I guess that was it"".   I agree and figure we'll look at it on Monday.

Monday I come in and head to the computer room.  A couple of other folks are there also we all peer through the clear plastic cover.   There are fragments of disk heads and filings from the platters piled up in the drive.   Of course  what is supposed to happen, is if there's a failure the disk assembly is supposed to unload the heads by fully retracting, a ""reset to zero"".  Clearly this didn't happen and the disk heads got jammed into the spinning platters and torn off their arms.  

Customer called in the local repair guys since this was a model of disk drive our guys didn't support, and I'm pretty sure it took a full day to repair the drive.  

Most amount of damage I ever saw in over twenty years in the business.  

This should give everyone an idea of what the unit was like, the one in Figure 2.

193,"Wrong department? That doesn't matter, JUST FIX IT NOW.","Quick backstory: New Years Resolutions, Christmas Presents, and incompetence combine into one horrific force of destruction . . . meaning that the first three months of every year, we get bombarded to hell and back with endless calls and emails. It also means that our wait times are *horrendous.* And I mean *hours long.* Not just a couple, even, I've had people who called in the morning and didn't get in until my evening shift. Now, I'm in the software department for these fancy treadmills, not the hardware -- I got no training or authorization to mess with the hardware. This results in callers who just waited 2-3 hours to get to me, but are now being told that since I can't help them they need to get in a queue for another few hours. Of course it sucks, but I've got no influence on it.

&#x200B;

Anyways, just got this absolute GEM of a human being.

**$ME:** \*general introduction including my name\*

**$GEM**: ""So my resistance isn't working at all.""

**$ME:** ""Ah, I'll have to transfer you to parts and service.""

**$GEM:** ""No, I want you to fix it.""

**$ME:** ""I'm sorry, but this is the software department. I can't help you, I need to send you to parts and service. Here, let me get you their direct number just in case - ""

**$GEM:** ""No, I need you to get me to someone who can fix it *now*.""

**$ME:** ""I can transfer you to parts and service, do you want their number as well?""

**$GEM:** ""Let me speak to a manager. What's your name?""

**$ME:** ""I'm \[name\], sir, and (after checking with sup) my supervisor is unavailable. I can give you their ema - ""

**$GEM:** ""I want your name, now, and I want a manager to call me ASAP.""

**$ME:** ""I'm \[name\], and I can ask them but I have little control over their schedule.""

**$GEM:** ""Just give me your name.""

**$ME:** ""I'm \[name\], sir, that's the third time you've asked.""

(I only give my first name, which works cos I'm the only me in the place, except for the one guy with same first and last name in an entire other department which is another story, but they don't work with customers at all)

**$GEM:** ""Then I'm asking again, what's your name?""

**$ME:** ""\[name\]""

**$GEM:** ""Your full name.""

**$ME:** ""I'm the only \[name\] here.""

**$GEM:** ""Your supervisor better call me, otherwise I' returning this machine. This service is horrible, and I've waited way too long.""

**$ME:** ""I'm very sorry, we're super busy this time of year.""

**$GEM:** ""Well you weren't too busy to take my money. \[insert long and largely repetitive rant\] and I hope that customer service becomes good again. Otherwise I'll be returning this machine and cancelling all my orders.""",115,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF1C4D30>
194,Broken tv,"Years ago, my wife worked at a local TV station helping people with the changeover from vhf to uhf signal. Some TV's required flicking a switch on the back or just doing something behind it. One gentleman called up, very agitated, claiming that the changeover had caused a split in the picture.  Literally one side of the screen was a different definition to the other side.  My wife and the local tech support were pulling their hair out to try and figure out what might have happened. Obviously nothing like this had happened before.  It took ages, and some very heated discussions until the gentleman finally realised that his TV was coated in dust and while  playing around at the back, he'd rubbed half the layer of dust off the screen.  Quite sheepish after that one.",24,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF1C4D90>
195,Where bad requests go to die,"I was reviewing my organization's ticket-queues to see if there was anything odd out there. I normally don't have to do this; we have several queues, but one is our Front queue, and is where everything starts. The other queues are for different groups of people, so they don't have to be notified of all the new stuff; only the front queue has notification. We have a whole helpline to monitor that queue, and we get text messages if critical tickets appear in it after hours.

In addition, there's a place in this software to indicate the application which applies to a ticket. We have some jobs which run reports based on Our application. We don't support anything else, so we don't look for anything. We get these reports daily, so we can see old tickets, unassigned tickets, and so on.

But today, I was looking at all the queues, not just our front one, and I found three tickets.

They hadn't been created by us, so they were put into one of queues that wasn't the Front. In fact, they used the queue for the highest-level group of people who rarely directly deal with clients.

These tickets had the wrong application selected.

And they had been created in October and November, involving the same agents from one of our manufacturing plants.

As far as I can tell, these guys created a ticket to get an account setup for a new user, then decided to send it to our deep, dark queue to get processed. They used an application we don't support, so it wouldn't have been caught that way.

They did this three times.

I should also mention that account requests go through an account request system that is wholly independent from the ticketing system.

So these agents used the wrong system, to create a ticket for the wrong application, and put it in the wrong group, in order to get an account created. They'd marked it low priority, anyway, but wow. I hope they weren't blaming us.

Also: There are how-to documents in the ticketing system that tell you ""If you need help with application X, then mark that as the application and assign to group X-group."" There's a document out there for us. They didn't use it.",25,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF1C4DF0>
196,The Agency: Part 5 - Don't Let the Door Hit You,"Hello everyone!  This is the next story in the saga of my time at **$Agency**, wherein **$BadMike** receives everything he so richly deserves.  All of this is from the best of my memory along with some personal records, but ultimately it is how I remember things.  There certainly can be some inaccuracies.  Also, I don't give permission for anyone else to use this.

TL/DR: Yeah, I don't do that.  Enjoy the story :)

Again, for context, I am not in IT; rather, I'm a GIS (Geographic Information Systems) professional.  This particular world is quite small, so I will do what I can to properly anonymize my tale.  For reference, during the course of these stories I was employed at a research agency affiliated with a major university.  Here is my Dramatis Personae:

* **$Me**: I wonder who this could be!
* **$Agency**: Research agency where I was working at the time.
* **$BadMike**: My first nemesis.
* **$MrScott**: Very nice guy, very smart, and completely clueless as a manager.  Sort of my superior at this point.
* **$DragonLady**: The director of $Agency.  Brilliant, great fundraiser, and similarly terrible at managing people.
* **$AwesomeBoss**: Operations manager.  Very awesome, very chill and approachable yet extremely competent.
* **$AwesomeRed**: Very awesome and intelligent analyst.  She was my best friend in the office.

When last we left off, all pretensions of cordiality that the GIS team had towards **$BadMike** evaporated.  He had mouthed off to me in a meeting, blaming me for his own failures that had clearly resulted from his laziness and incompetence.  In response, I'd filed a formal complaint against him.  I didn't really expect anything to come of it - after all, we'd been putting up with this behavior for over two years at that point - but at least I had been honest and said what I needed to say.  After all, if a person looks, sounds, and acts like dog sh\*t, more than likely they are dog sh\*t, not a GIS Analyst.

Following the Incident^(TM), **$BadMike** and I rarely spoke with one another.  H\*ll, we rarely looked at one another.  We were in a shared, open office, but there was an invisible wall running right down the center that everyone knew was there and everybody respected.  I was ok with this, in fact.  My anger burned brightly.  I would keep this up until one of us broke.  *And I intended not to break*.

A couple of weeks later, I walked into the office to see **$BadMike** hunched forward at his desk.  He was reading some sort of paper - and his eyes were red.  As I sat down in front of my own computer, I glanced over and could tell that he was actually crying!  Honestly I really didn't know what was going on nor did I care.  I didn't think that **$DragonLady** would have acted this soon on any sort of direct punishment for him.  I didn't think she'd act at all, in fact.  So I figured this was something else.  For most of the day, I just ignored him.  The entire day he held that paper in his hands and kept glancing at it.  Periodically he'd turn to me like he wanted to say something, but I never turned back.  Yeah, I suppose I was acting kind of heartless, but I had given up having a heart for someone that had caused me so much pain and frustration.

The next day, he seemed to have recovered, and we were back to the same old indifference.  Around midmorning, though, **$AwesomeBoss** came into the office and told me that I needed to speak with **$DragonLady**.  My eyes popped open, the proverbial ""*uh oh*"" situated on my tongue.  This couldn't be good.  I grabbed a notepad and followed her.  Once I entered **$DragonLady**'s office, **$AwesomeBoss** shut the door and left.  It was just me and **$DragonLady**.  My mind was racing.  What had I done?  I felt certain that I was getting fired or at least a stern talking to.  All manner of things went through my mind.  But it was **$DragonLady** that spoke first:

>**$DragonLady**: So we've noticed that you have been doing a lot of good work for us.  I appreciate it.  While I cannot change your pay band, I can ask for an amendment to your contract to bring your pay on par with those that are performing similar duties.  
>  
>**$Me**: (blinking) ...What?  
>  
>**$DragonLady**: (slides a piece of paper over to me with a *20% raise!*) This is your new pay grade.  
>  
>**$Me**: (looking at it, completely flabbergasted) Woah... um... thank you!  Oh my God...  
>  
>**$DragonLady**: Oh, and gather up your things from your desk.  
>  
>**$Me**: What?  
>  
>**$DragonLady**: <other GIS staff member> just resigned.  And there's no reason why you should have your desk in the intern's office.  We're giving you that office instead.  Gather your things and speak to IT to get everything set up.  
>  
>**$Me**: Holy crap... yes, sure, I'll do that.  
>  
>**$DragonLady**: Oh, and also, keep this to yourself.  Raises and consideration like this were not given to everybody.

As she said that last sentence, there was an odd, knowing smile on her face.  I smiled back and thanked her profusely.  Like I said before, **$DragonLady** and me had our issues, but I certainly wasn't upset about something like this :)  And my mind was completely blown here - it wasn't expected at all!  Seriously, I thought I was about to get walked out!  Also, consider the insinuation here - I was given a 20% raise to ""*bring me on par with others performing similar duties*.""  To me, that meant **$BadMike** had been making about *20% more* than me to come in and f\*ck up things for years!  Sweet baby Jesus...

Anyways, I got back to my desk in the company of a smiling **$AwesomeBoss**, who opened the new office for me and told me to start gathering my things.  As I did so, I saw **$BadMike** look over to me.  The look on his face was... *quizzical?*  No, not that, more like vulnerable.  His expression read something like ""*You're leaving?*""  As if, despite all the hostility between us, he didn't want me to go.  I didn't say anything to him as I gathered my things and turned off my PC.  Once I had everything, I just walked out the door - leaving him behind me.

The new office was the best, and **$AwesomeRed** would come in there pretty much every day so we could talk to each other.  It was so cool!  I'd never had anything like this before.  Also, I didn't have to veil my speech or anything, we could just talk.  Very soon, our conversations turned to **$BadMike**.  I brought up the piece of paper I saw him staring at the other day and the fact that he was crying.  **$AwesomeRed** immediately morphed, transformers-style, into gossip mode.

>**$AwesomeRed**: Oh my God, that!  He didn't tell you?  
>  
>**$Me**: I haven't said two words to him in weeks, so that'd be a nope.  
>  
>**$AwesomeRed**: It was a notice of inadequate performance and an action plan.  If he screws up one more time before the end of the fiscal year, they won't renew his contract.  He'll be done!  
>  
>**$Me:** Woah!  Wait, you mean he has just one chance and he's out?  
>  
>**$AwesomeRed**: (with the most devious smile I'd ever seen on her face) Yep!

I shook my head in utter disbelief.  This was it!  The light was shining at the end of the tunnel!  I could see us being rid of this cancer forever!

Then, of course, reality set in.  I told myself that there was no way that they'd actually go ahead with this.  **$BadMike** would spin something he did onto someone else, diverting blame or throwing out just enough plausible deniability to keep from being held fully accountable.  Or **$MrScott** or even **$DragonLady** would decide to overlook a ""minor issue"" and keep him onboard.  Or this could just be yet another of their continual ""grand proclamations"" that never amounted to anything.  Or any of a dozen other things.  However, for me, it was less of an issue now.  So long as I didn't have to deal with **$BadMike**, and so long as we could just bypass him in everything we did, it didn't really matter.  I wasn't going to actively persecute the guy anymore.  My life had taken a substantial turn for the better.  It was time for me to move forward.  He wasn't my problem anymore.

As it turns out, the impetus for **$BadMike**'s downfall did not come from me, but rather from those that had previously been his allies - **$MrScott** and **$DragonLady**.

A few weeks later, **$MrScott** called me into his office.  He wanted me to check something for him.  Turns out, **$DragonLady** and **$MrScott** had issued a mapping project to **$BadMike**, and they wanted to see if there were any problems with it.  Checking it would have to happen while he wasn't in the office, so they wanted me to come in after hours to go through this.  Would that be ok?

I knew exactly what this meant, though I don't think that **$MrScott** understood that I was aware of the details of **$BadMike**'s action plan.  Y'all, it wasn't my intention to be the one to kick **$BadMike** in the testicles at the time, but if he just placed them right in front of me, I wasn't going to waste the opportunity.  If this could guarantee that he was dismissed, then not only me but *the rest of the team* would be rid of his awfulness.  I said sure.  I hope **$MrScott** did not detect the glee in my voice.

I spent 10 hours going through every possible facet of that project.  **$BadMike** had been given a cloropleth mapping assignment meant to show different characteristics, each with its own color ramp and symbolization.  What I found was that he had used the correct symbologies and notes throughout the maps - but he had forgotten to change the underlying data!  So, for example, if Map 1 was supposed to show ""*Number of Dog Poops Cleaned Up in City Parks*,"" while Map 2 was supposed to show ""*Number of Dog Poops Set on Fire on Doorsteps*,"" he had not changed the data when he produced Map 2 from the first one.  So the two maps actually looked identical, they merely had different color schemes.   About half of the maps were wrong.  There were some other minor issues but these were the most egregious.

I wrote up all my findings and hand-delivered it **$MrScott**.  (Yes, I sent him an email too)

After that, I really didn't hear anything back.  I wasn't made privy to anything that **$BadMike** was working on, so I just sort of ignored him.  Again, I really didn't think that there was going to be any resolution to any of this.  I spoke to **$AwesomeRed** every once in a while about it, but she hadn't heard anything herself.  And while I hoped that all the work I'd done after hours wasn't wasted, ultimately I tried my best to put it out of my mind.

Months went by until, eventually, we got to the end of the fiscal year.  The last day came... *and went*... and **$BadMike** was still here.  I had actually gotten myself a little hyped up for an announcement or something, only to have it fizzle after the year ended.  A few days later, I spoke to **$AwesomeRed**.  We brought up **$BadMike** \- why was he still here?  Had **$DragonLady** and **$MrScott** reneged on the whole action plan?

**$AwesomeRed** told me that the big bosses had given **$BadMike** ""a few more months,"" working month-to-month until he found a new job.  He wasn't on a contract anymore.  Lol - this meant that, despite knowing he was about to get canned, he still hadn't started looking for something new.  Dipsh\*t.  Anyways, it was... news.  Not what I hoped.  I'm not even sure what I hoped at the time.  But to me, I felt like ""a few more months"" could mean anything, from 1-2 all the way to a year or more.  As I was speaking to **$AwesomeRed**, I said something about never being rid of him, that nothing I could do would ever change that.  I must have looked really upset.

That's when **$AwesomeRed** stopped me.  She countered that I couldn't be more wrong, that I was the main reason why he was about to get the boot.  I had been the one to constantly report on his bad work; I had been the one to formally complain about him; and I had been the one to discover his errors during his action plan.  Her words were pure encouragement, music to my ears.  **$AwesomeRed**, I know you will see this; thank you so much, you're the best :)  Honestly, I started to gain some encouragement from her words.  And I even became hopeful that we'd hear something about his imminent dismissal.

Two months later, we all received an email:

>Dear **$Agency**,  
>  
>**$BadMike** has accepted a position with <other employer>.  His last day will be <date>.  Please join us at <local restaurant> for his going-away celebration at <such and such time>.  
>  
>\- **$DragonLady**

As soon as I read it, I shot up from my chair to go say something - but before I could do so, I saw **$AwesomeRed** and **$AwesomeBoss** standing in the doorway to my office.  Both of them had the biggest sh\*t-eating grins on their faces.  The moment I saw them, I had only one word on my lips:

>**$Me**: *Yeah!!*

I started counting down the days.  **$BadMike**'s ""going-away celebration"" was to be held on his last day there.  The whole celebration itself was sort of a farce - virtually everyone at **$Agency** knew that he was on an action plan, that his contract had been canceled, and that he had basically been fired.  But we went along with the pretensions anyway.

At the restaurant, I sat as far away from him as I possibly could.  Most people were in good spirits, even those talking to him.  *I wonder why?* \>:D  Even I was happy, getting the chance to have a breather and just chat with my coworkers.  After I finished eating, I walked outside.  I didn't really want to be in there anymore.  Just before the party ended, **$BadMike** came outside to talk to me.  He said that he learned a lot while he worked with me, and I said the same.  He wished me well, and I did the same, and I shook his hand.

***And then he was gone***.  That was the last time I ever saw or spoke to him.

I walked home from the restaurant that evening.  It was a beautiful day - hot and muggy, just like any other here in the South, but still beautiful.  I stopped at a bunch of the street corners along the way just to take it in.  As I walked, I felt the burden, the stress, the anxiety, all of it lifting from my shoulders.  When I got back to the apartment I shared with my wife, I just fell backwards onto our bed, completely serene.  *Ah yes, the soft delight of vanquishing a foe*.  This was it - *this* was that soft delight.  I closed my eyes and fell into the most peaceable sleep that I have ever known.

:)

That is, of course, until other events at **$Agency** were to rouse me from that peace.  But those are stories for later.  I hope you all have enjoyed this, and until tomorrow, take care!

197,Tales from the 1980s Super Mini. That time he almost killed the Sys Manager by Accident,"tldr: This is long and more detailed than the usual story.  It really kinda needs the detail unless you were in tech support back then...sorry in advance: Honestly, it looked shorter in openwriter for some reason...

Preface: This promises to be the first of many technical and detailed recounts of a short-list of people I worked with closely during the 1980s, supporting a very popular and successful computer company in the Super mini computer market place, particularly involving On-Line Transaction Processors (OLTP), for uses in manufacturing, sales, and many of the early Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) applications of that day, prior to the official use of ERP as a market tool definition.

As a new, fresh out of Ace training CE, I was paired with a senior CE, who we will call Joe. If you passed him on the street you would surmise he was a farmer. He WAS a farmer. He owned a Cow. He had 9 kids. He lived in the Rural outskirts of Baltimore, when there was such a place. He always looked like a farmer, even with his tie on. He had facial hair.

On this day, He has a call for a possible disk drive crash, and I had recently finished training on the model 7933 unit, which had a mind blowing 404MB of storage, with all of the newest things like data interlacing, whereby the drive would write a file in a staggered fashion, as it flew down the disc track, with the knowledge that, once written, it would be able to be recalled or read at full speed, owing to the embedded knowledge of all the remaining latencies that hardware between it and the CPU induced. No need to write it continuously, since the eventual reader could not handle all of that data in one bite. I hope that explains it well enough.\\, but comment if you want more tech info.

Well, before I get back to the technical, lets paint a picture of this company with the down computer. All generic as I wish to throw no one under a bus here. The Sys Admin was not a friendly guy, and took every opportunity to berate or take advantage of Joe, as Joe was assigned to this account. Joe wasn't particularly interested in using this client for my training, but suggested I better get used to seeing the “fixing people AND computers” side of the business.

 We arrive on site and Mean Sys Admin is fit to be tied, and using us as the personification of the computer brand at fault.Joe does his best to align, triangulate, and ignore the rantings, and finally, once the bad guy in this story has convinced himself that he has exacted his pound of flesh, we get to work.

 Yep, the drive has crashed and so we had to replace the disk pack, all of the heads, and realign them all. Most especially the servo track head, which was how this drive measured where the other heads were, in relation to each other. Now in this day, the disks themselves would expand and contract slightly, based on the surface temperature, which was affected by the amount of seek speed and write or read activity they were enduring.To compensate for this reality of physics, each head was adjustable, using a long narrow tool that was used, in combination with the LED readout on the unit front bezel, to dial in each head to a tolerance, close to where the servo head was. Every five minutes or sooner, based on the ambient temperature of airflow within the 7933, the Servo head electronics would force a Servo Head realignment function, that would cause the heavy head carriage to do a full inward and outward seek of all 1300+ tracks across the compare and offset what it was seeing in signal strength, with all of the other heads. 

This was a very violent push pull event of maybe 5 pounds of mass jamming forward and backwards in the fraction of a second.For this reason, there were two clips that needed to be shorted on the Servo Drive PCA, such that no auto head temperature realignment function would occur while the CE had his or her hands in there holding an alignment tool that resembled a hard metal spear...During this manual alignment of each disk head, much of the protective cowling is removed, and so this was an important jumper to have in place whenever adjusting disk heads manually.

So Joe has been taking a bit more time doing these things to make sure I am picking up all of the nuances, and the Sys Admin has come back several time to get an update on when his users would once again be able to get back to work. Recall that this was before PCs, and when the main frame went down, anybody in data collection or analysis was free to have some coffee, chat amongst themselves or use this time to remind their bosses of how hard their job is , when their tools don't work right.In addition to his facial hair, Joe has no ability to hide it when his blood pressure rises, and he is really getting farmer mad about this guy that is pushing his last button. So as we are completing the manual head adjustments, Joe is explaining and congratulating me for being able to do a usually simple series of tasks, and just as he is reminding me that the override jumper is very important, he takes it off the Servo drive PCA, except the high grade steel head alignment tool was still connected to a head on the actuator. This drive is up and running. Heads are hovering over the disk surface at the equivalent height of a Boeing 747 flying 4 inches off the ground. The drive takes its first opportunity to fix the pesky temperature variance, that the jumper was cock blocking it from correctly, so as soon as the first clip from that jumper was pinched open, the 7933 sprang into action and performed a MOASS (Mother of all Servo Seeks) that, in addition to surprising the hell out of both Joe and I, it snapped off the adjust tool, which went flying to parts unknown.

That was not the end of this story. This is the end of this first episode. Joe had a large flat blade 12” screw driver in his hand, as he was already contemplating buttoning up the outer shell and top bezel, which would have benefited from such a tool. We look at each other, and even though the drive itself was undamaged, the combination of trying to maintain decorum with the client, teach me, and fix a major disk drive crash, was just too much in one day for this Farmer. 

He hauls back and axe throws this heavy screw driver across the room towards the door Just as said Sys Admin was coming in to interrogate what had just happened, since the entire computer room was wrapped in glass and visible from the offices. The screw driver impaled itself into the drywall portion of the wall nearest the door, and about 5 feet in front of the guy right at eye level. Right were he might have been in 1 second.He looked at it, turned around in the direction that would allow him NOT to look at us or make eye contact, and left the room. We collected all tools broken or still functional, checked out everything, and had the operators start their reloads, and we walked out. 

The Sys Admin manager decided to give us our space, as he was certain Farmer Joe had made it clear were the boundaries were.  Joe never heard anything derogatory from the customer, and actually life got better for him when working on that site.",47,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF1C4EB0>
198,Matters of the CPU.,"I was called to go check a computer at a cyber cafe\` that BSOD'd every time it attempted to load Windows. Instantly I know that the OS crashed and the machine needs formatting. I plug in my W10 flashdisk but it BSOD'd. I think, ""Maybe it's the drive."" so I use a CD but then again, it BSOD'd. Frustrated, I switch the BIOS EFI/Legacy and Secure Boot settings up and down trying to see what would work but nada. Every copy of Windows I had, 7, 8,8.1, BSOD'd. Thinking it's the HDD, I had the owner allow me to backup their documents so I could swap the HDDs. While using Hiren's BootCD, I ran Mini Windows 7 and it BSOD'd. It try MiniXP and it also BSOD'd. Next I tried Kaspersky Rescue Disk which is a Linux distro and it booted. I then tried G-Parted and a Linux Mint CD I had and they both booted right to the desktop. Confused, I told them to use Mint till I figured out what the problem was.

Fast forward to the next day after having Googled the hell out of every possible phrase that'll get me the results I wanted but nothing helpful came by. Multiple calls to people more experienced than me but this was a relatively new scenario for each and every one of these veteran repair technicians. I finally swapped HDDS but the problem still persisted. WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH THIS DAMN MACHINE?! The motherboard? The Cyber Cafe owner doesn't want to use Linux because there aren't any timer programs available for Linux and the most prominent one, CyberCafePro, is Windows only.

The owner finally decides to get a motherboard replacement. I take the motherboard back to the shop, spot a dormant machine then start it to make sure it's working and it's working fine but it lacks a HDD. I then swap processors (Intel Core 2 Duo) but the issue still persists. As a last measure, i try the processor of the dormant machine on the motherboard I brought in and what do you know?! It actually works. The motherboard was fine. Somehow the problem was with the processor refusing Windows.

TL:DR; Computer wouldn't work with Windows, only Linux and it ended up being their processor.",41,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF1C4F10>
199,"I'm Not Paying For Your Patch Management ""Scam""","As an independent IT consultant, I have a broad portfolio of clients. Many are small businesses that don't have enough users to justify a full-time IT professional nor do they have a complicated set up needing anything more than semi-regular maintenance and the occasional support call. A few of these clients though engage me to conduct regular maintenance of their systems. For convenience, I usually roll it all together into a support contract and cut them a good hourly rate since it is all work I can do on my own schedule, off hours. Occasionally though I will get the client that still wants me to perform these services, but at an hourly rate, thinking they are making out financially with that arrangement. ""No problem,"" is usually my answer, ""whatever works for you."" Though, truth be told when I run my numbers at the end of the year every single time a client that does this thinking they are saving money, always ends up paying more. But, that isn't my problem....

This introduction leads me to one of my latest stories. I was at one such client that keeps me on an hourly rate. The manager thinks he is a smart guy and by doing this he is keeping his IT expenses down. I  have offered a contract rate multiple times and even have given him numbers on not only how it will save him money but how he can use it to project expenses. No dice though. This guy is dead set that his way saves money. Can't say I didn't try....

**In the Office**

It was a Tuesday morning and I was in the area so I decided to swing by to pay this particular client a visit. I get there and the office is half empty with the manager no where to be seen. So I just go about my business tending to a few tickets and setting up a workstation for a new hire.

About half way into the one task, the manager sees me and comes over with a hurried look on his face holding some papers.

Manager: ""Hey IT Guy I've been meaning to give you a call....I know your bill is due here in a few days...""

Customers are always late paying my invoices. Always. So I don't even really look at my aging accounts until they are at least 30 days in arrears, but anyway...

IT Guy: ""Oh yeah no problem if you need a few more days. Just if you could pay me directly I would appreciate it. Trying to cut out checks and paper.""

Manager: ""It isn't that. I had a question about a few hours you charged me for something called 'patch management'....""

IT Guy: ""Yeah that was for configuring and setting up your new Windows Update server. Should be just for labor as I was able to use some existing equipment you had around....It should be up and running. I'll check logs when I'm in today.""

Manager: ""Yeah that is where I am confused. Doesn't Windows update itself automatically? I mean why are we paying for a service that runs itself?""

(I go into some of the technical reasons why a company probably does not want to rely upon automatic Windows updates...)

Manager: ""My issue is you are charging me for something that we just don't need. I understand you IT guys wan to make everything complicated, but this whole patch management thing just sounds like a scam to get some extra hours that are completely unnecessary...""

IT Guy: ""Well it is really your call. If you don't want to manage patches and updates I'll just turn on automatic updates for every workstation and server and take it out of my scope of work...""

Manager: ""Do that. I don't need to pay for this unnecessary 'scam' service. I'm sure our employees can figure out how to click the 'update Windows' button themselves when it pops up...."" (laughing at his own little joke)

(I explain to him the downsides of that but tell him it is ultimately his decision.)

IT Guy: ""If that is what you want, I'll email you over an addendum to sign and then I'll set workstations and servers to automatically update.""

If you wondered why it sounded like I was playing it cool despite this guy being somewhat of a jerk, it is because they are a decent client despite this manager being a pain on occasion. This also wouldn't be the first time the manager has made a technical decision that came back to bite him and I ended up making more money off of him doing emergency work to fix it.

**Windows Updating....**

I finish my work and roll out some policies to turn on automatic updates. Then take a quick look at the logs and see that a lot of workstations are going to be doing a lot of updating. You see about a year ago the manager decided we needed to actively manage patches because some guy told him that is what ""IT Sec"" means so that is what he had me do. Now he apparently forgot about that and thinks it is an unnecessary expense. (This is why most business managers look like idiots). I think about sending an email to the company to let them know what to expect and then decide not to because, well, it really wasn't my problem.

So about four hours go by and my cell phone starts to ring. It is the manager. I'm driving so don't pick up figuring the call is probably not urgent. Phone rings again three minutes later, then again three minutes after that. OK clearly they have an emergency so I pull over and give him a call back.

Manager: ""IT Guy what the heck did you do????""

IT Guy: ""What do you mean....""

Manager: ""Our sales team is in the middle of a huge presentation via video conference and all the workstations just started updating!!!!!""

IT Guy: ""They are set to do that automatically now, as we discussed.""

Manager: ""This is a disaster....we have a million dollar contract on the line!""

IT Guy: ""There isn't much you can do if the update is already running. You just have to let it finish.""

Manager: ""How long is that??????""

IT Guy: ""Minutes to maybe hours, not sure depends on how big and how many...""

Manager: ""I need you to come here NOW and fix this!""

IT Guy: ""I was headed to another client but if you want to me log this an emergency work I can put that off till tomorrow...""

Manager: ""I don't care just get here ASAP and help get us back online!""

IT Guy: ""Ok sure thing. I'm turning around now and will be there in about 15-20 minutes. Put me on with the sales team and I'll see if I can talk him through a workaround.""

As I am driving to the client's office I know full well there is nothing I can do to get his workstations back up but remember I had just installed a new one that should be fully updated. I tell the sales guy to pull that laptop, give him the admin credentials, and they use that to get back online to complete the presentation.

When I arrive, the manager tells me to just do whatever it takes to fix this situation and make sure it never happens again. I'm happy to oblige and later that month billed him for a lot of double time. So much for my ""patch management scam"" eh, Mr. Manager....

TLDR...Manager thinks he will save a few hours in IT consultant time by reverting to automatic Windows backups. Decision blows up in his face when an important sales presentation gets tanked because an unscheduled backup decided to run. Ends up paying me a lot more money to fix the problem he created.

Post Script....Oh and in case you were wondering, I heard about a month later that the company won that contract despite the almost botched sales pitch. Also it appears the manager has been replaced by headquarters and I am unsure if he had anything to do directly with what happened though.",33,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF1C4F70>
200,He Says the BIOS is Bad,"Hi all, let me start by saying I have been enjoying the tales here for a while now and figured it is time to start documenting some of my experiences. This story took place about 4 years ago. I already had enough experience at this point to know that anything a user tells you should be taken with a grain of salt. So let's get into the details.

A user submitted a ticket where the computer was stuck in a boot loop and making an awful beeping sound if booted while connected to the dock. The odd thing is, this is only happening if the computer is docked at their desk. I found this odd, so I reached out through our office IM solution. I like to ask clarifying questions whenever the issue is a bit murky, so I started with verbally confirming that the issue only occurs when the laptop is docked and if undocked it boots with no issue. Once they confirmed, they informed me that their cubicle neighbor was into computers and told them the issue was that the BIOS had become corrupted, and the motherboard would need to be replaced. I informed the user that this is one of the possibilities but that I'd need to investigate further before we came to that conclusion. In the back of my mind, I thought this didn't make much sense since the computer can boot normally, just not when docked at the desk. This smelled of some sort of hardware issue to me. Since they were in the office, I had them come to me first and demonstrate a normal boot off the dock. I then tested on a dock in our IT lab to see if the same issue occurred. No issues at all. At this point the user wanted to reiterate what their colleague had told them and ask if that's something I could address. I was obviously skeptical of the assessment and suggested we take it to the desk so I can observe the issue. So we walk out, they connect to the dock and then boot up. As the system is booting, I notice on the POST output that it's indicating that an F-key was pressed and then it immediately started beeping loudly so we power it down. This of course grabs the attention of the desk neighbor who begins watching my troubleshooting process. I tell the user that it would seem that a key might be stuck on their external keyboard and ask that they disconnect it and then try booting again. Wouldn't you know, the system boots perfectly! I take the culprit back to my lab and dispose of it and bring back a fresh keyboard. Problem solved, and no MB replacement needed.

Years of working in IT will teach you that no matter how much computer hobby experience an end user has (in this case the desk neighbor), if they haven't ever worked desktop support, accept everything they claim with a healthy dose of skepticism.",172,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF01AF40>
201,I thought the computer needed to be reimaged?,"Background
So this was my first deployment as a 25B (help desk guy that likes the color green) I had been doing the things my MOS is designed for for the first time in 2 years since joining the army. I had been deployed for 4 months and gotten comfortable. Made plenty of mistakes though like getting rid of about 50 users access to their files and folders on a shared drive trying to consolidate permissions. This was the first mistake where I felt like the user wanted to hit me though.

I show up to my shift and was told to “fix” a computer for the PAO( photographers that like wearing green) over the last couple of months “fix” a computer means to reimage it. I start working on it going through the process and finish after lunch. Call the user and tell them their computer is ready to be picked up. User is an attractive female about my age and is really nice and not intimidating at all. She picks it up leaves and I go on and finish my shift. 

I forget how long it was but I think it was the next day or the day after that. I come in on my shift my boss and E6 staff sergeant calls me to her desk. She was super smart and super nice as well and I liked here even after the events below.

SSG York: what the fuck Did you do to the PAOs computer she called and was very upset that all her software is gone. 

PFC dumbass: (confused) I didn’t realize she wanted me to install google chrome or some other piece of software after I finished the image on the PAOs computer.

SSG York: you did what?! I didn’t tell you to reimage her computer I wanted you to “fix” the computer by doing a QC check and make sure there were no issues on it.  The software I’m talking about is photoshop. I reimaged her computer and put her licensed copies of photoshop onto it before you reimaged the computer. She’s coming here now so you better Explain what you did to her computer and hope she doesn’t try to kill you.

I knew I fucked up. I haven’t worked with photoshop much but I know it’s not cheap. So PAO walks in and she’s mad and I’m scared she’s going to throw the nearest object at me. She’s not big at all same height as me but skinny I still thought she could have picked me up and slammed me on the ground in that moment though. We have a waist high divider between me and her so I have a little bit of protection stopping her from charging me. I’m able to explain what happened and that it was my mistake. She still has the original photoshop installs and licenses that the SSG used when she worked on the computer first. I take her computer and start to unfuck my fuckup. I scavenge 2 1tb HDD since the laptop only came with a 500gb one and I find 2 sticks of 16gb ram as well. I install all the software and make sure it works then call her back by the end of the day. I’m saying sorry almost every word and explaining how I upgraded he laptop as well. She’s still a little mad but doesn’t look like she’s looking for something to throw at me. She takes the computer and I don’t hear back from her for awhile so I doesn’t look like I screwed up anything else. After that any time I saw her walking around the office Id avoid her cause I’m still not certain if she is  mad at me or not. After awhile I start making jokes about what happened and she laughs. She ended up forgiving me and didn’t hold anything against me after that.",28,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF1C4FD0>
202,Out of memory? But I only see 1GB of usage!,"Hey guys,

First time poster, long time lurker, my time has finally come to join you and contribute to this awesome subreddit.

&#x200B;

**Introduction:** I'm a technician for a hosting company, we're not exactly over-staffed so everyone does anything they're capable of, including support. So, fast forward to the story, a wild customer appears on our chat platform.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Indeed, the 10GB folder when expanded had 2 sub-folders with 500MB each, but the interface only showed FOLDERS and not FILES. Think of a folder tree when you install something in your computer.

&#x200B;

>**$Me:** Correct, the subfolders within your main folder are 1GB both, but this interface does not show the files, please access your Files section for an expanded view of the files as well.

&#x200B;

Guys... imagine 2 folders and 10 files in a tree-like interface (or Details folder view mode for Windows users)

Not the first nor the third, middle, or last file, but the second file was 8.99GB.

203,"Nvm, let me just make sure my warranty will be voided completely instead of listening to you"," I occasionally get some users that make me question the most basic stuff.               

I do customer/tech support for GPS trackers, cameras, etc and I never had the devices in my hand since I work for a US based company, but Im located in Europe. 99,9% of the time it's not an issue, I can read manuals and I can ask any ""stupid"" question about the devices themselves on slack if needed, but sometimes I feel I shouldn't need to.                  

One tale from yesterday:                                
Customer ordered a hidden camera, but we accidentally sent out one that records audio as well. This is fine if you have a legal base for it (that's why we have them, just in case), but in most states it's illegal to record someone with a camera and capture audio as well. Manufacturer has an easy fix for that, just extract some files onto the SD card and literally just turn it off and on again and wait for 40 seconds. I sent the instruction to the customer as well, the manual was also provided before.              


Customer reply: ""I extracted the files, but there is NO WAY to turn the unit off, so I'm stuck!!! I also tried to reset it and I think it worked because all the recordings are gone. Attached is a picture from the device"". The picture showed the front side of the device.                


This irritated me. I checked the manual again, there is clearly a power switch on the backside of the device, not far from the reset hole. I wondered if the unit was completely different from the ones we usually sell since it has audio recording activated, but the front was literally the same. So I sent a screenshot of the ""parts description"" to my colleague in the US, asking if the power switch turns it on and off. He said yes, that's definitely what it looks like. And in that exact moment, I just felt like a complete idiot.                    
  
So I replied to the customer: ""Have you tried the power switch on the back?"" and attached the parts description (which was included in the manual I sent previously) with a big arrow to the power switch.                               

A few hours he replied with: ""Nvm, I cut the cable to the microphone, it was easy"".                     

I just feel so insecure when the most basic stuff like hitting an ON/OFF button is apparently too complicated. In my mind, no one can be this dense. But I'm also glad some are, otherwise I wouldn't have a job lol.                      

Extra: I also had a customer asking if their 4G Tracker runs on 4G or 3G. The 4G is included in the name and he wrote it out in the request as well.",30,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF1C51C0>
204,The Agency: Part 4 - An Avalanche of Accountability,"Hello everyone!  This is the next story in the saga of my time at **$Agency**, wherein the laziness and incompetence of **$BadMike** finally catches up with him.  All of this is from the best of my memory along with some personal records, but ultimately it is how I remember things.  There certainly can be some inaccuracies.  Also, I don't give permission for anyone else to use this.

TL/DR: Yeah, I don't do that.  Enjoy the story :)

Again, for context, I am not in IT; rather, I'm a GIS (Geographic Information Systems) professional.  This particular world is quite small, so I will do what I can to properly anonymize my tale.  For reference, during the course of these stories I was employed at a research agency affiliated with a major university.  Here is my Dramatis Personae:

* **$Me**: I wonder who this could be!
* **$Agency**: Research agency where I was working at the time.
* **$BadMike**: My first nemesis.
* **$MrScott**: Very nice guy, very smart, and completely clueless as a manager.  Also my direct superior.
* **$DragonLady**: The director of $Agency.  Brilliant, great fundraiser, and similarly terrible at managing people.
* **$AwesomeBoss**: New operations manager.  Very awesome, very chill and approachable yet extremely competent.
* **$AwesomeRed**: New analyst we hired, very awesome and intelligent.  She became my best friend in the office.

When last we left off with the main story of **$Agency**, we had started to see our team mature substantially as a GIS organization.  **$AwesomeBoss** was now in charge of almost everything on the team and we'd managed to sidestep **$MrScott** for most of our duties.  We had significantly more staff,  were putting out more products, and were refining our processes.  For most of the year since the fiasco with the network analysis, **$BadMike** had been sidelined by everyone else, mostly so that we could just get our work done.  However, with GIS becoming increasingly more visible at **$Agency**, the powers-that-be wanted to ensure that **$BadMike** was justified as a compliment to the team.  He was increasingly being held responsible for the quality of his work.

The avalanche of accountability started out slow.

Among the first events to occur in this drama happened towards the end of the calendar year.  We were given a quick-turnaround project to flag a number of records based on information held in other fields.  There were only a few thousand, and to a team that regularly dealt with features containing millions of records, this was no big deal.  The dataset was split in half between myself and **$BadMike**, and we were both given half a day to add the necessary flags.  I remember specifically that everything was due at 1 PM.  Don't ask me how I remember that - I can't remember a single one of my high school English teachers' names.  But I remember when this minor, inconsequential flagging project was due.  *randomshit.png*

I got started immediately.  SQL queries, LIKE functions, sorting, that kind of thing.  But as I commenced my work, I got that familiar sickening feeling that I'd wind up doing everything anyways.  And I was pretty tired of that.  Remember how I told everyone that **$BadMike** and I shared an office?  I decided to do a bit of snooping while I worked.  Every 15 minutes or so, I pushed my chair back, ostensibly to stretch.  What I was really doing was looking at **$BadMike**'s screen.  For the entirety of the morning (when he was supposed to be working), he was doing nothing but surfing news websites.   I jotted everything down in my notebook.  Just after 12 PM, I noticed that he finally loaded up the actual project itself, which meant that he spent an hour, at most, doing anything on it.

Once time was up, **$AwesomeBoss** and **$MrScott** came into the office to see where we were on things and reconcile the datasets.  **$BadMike** sent his information off to everybody, including me (since I had to assemble everything together).  The bosses asked if we'd had time to create all the necessary flags.  **$BadMike** immediately popped up and said that he'd done so, listing the steps he'd taken in the process.  \*grinds teeth\* *Lying little sh\*t...*  Anyways, since I knew he'd almost invariably missed something, and since I'd been working on the dataset since that morning (and knew a bunch of the key words and phrases), I immediately opened his work and started some queries.  What do you know?  There were extensive omissions that I was able to locate immediately.  Literally while he was speaking to the others saying he'd ""completed"" everything, I popped up and said, ""Well it looks like you missed this one.  And this one.  And this one.  And this one...""  And so on and so forth, ad nauseum.

The others clustered around my computer to see what was going on and **$BadMike** seemed to want to go into argument mode.  But having the data right there was completely d\*mning - any jacka$$ could just look at my screen and see the records with reserved terms that were not flagged!  Both of our bosses looked irritated.  They asked me to go ahead and flag everything where **$BadMike** hadn't.  So I did.  It took me until the end of the day. :/

A few days later, I was speaking to **$AwesomeBoss** when she brought up this project.  She asked why I had gotten everything completed while **$BadMike** hadn't, as apparently we'd missed some deliverable because of it.  My response was something like ""Well, he was checking the news until about an hour before everything was due, so I assumed he probably missed something.""  **$AwesomeBoss**'s eyes narrowed.  She asked me how I knew this - I told her what I'd done, looking at his computer screen every 15 minutes.  But more importantly, I also told her that I'd *recorded this in the project documentation* (which, of course, **$BadMike** had not even looked at, much less added anything to).  Ah, my first encounter with almighty CYA!  **$AwesomeBoss** tersely thanked me and asked me to leave.  A bit later, **$BadMike** wound up going to an impromptu meeting between himself, **$DragonLady**, **$AwesomeBoss**, and **$MrScott**.  He didn't come back for a while.  When he finally returned, he looked very sullen/pissed off.  Sucks to suck, doesn't it, dude?  >:D

Anyways, despite **$BadMike** now getting yelled at whenever he screwed up, the rest of us still had work to do.  And by design that work didn't involve him in pretty much any way, shape, or form.  However, in short order, without any of our knowledge or input management inexplicably decided that **$BadMike** was going to be involved in the team - *one way or another*.  Our first introduction to this came right out of left field.

Over the course of the year, we'd started to have weekly meetings with **$DragonLady** to report what we were working on (and for her to modify/reassign/f\*ck with those assignments as she desired).  At one of these meetings, I brought up my duties for that week.  The conversation went something like this:

>**$Me**: And so I'm going to work on this particular analysis, then complete this report, then I need to update this dataset, and then -  
>  
>**$DragonLady**: No, you won't be updating that dataset.  That's $BadMike's job.  
>  
>**$Me**: (freezing, too blindsided to think of anything else to say) ...*What?*  
>  
>**$DragonLady**: This is part of $BadMike's duties.  We've placed him in charge of updating data.  This is something he needs to do.  
>  
>**$Me**: (not realizing who I'm talking to and close to a panic attack) We... *need* this data for active projects.  This is not something we can sideline.  It has to be held to high scrutiny and standards.  With what we've seen in the past...  
>  
>**$DragonLady**: There will be procedures in place to ensure high accuracy for this data.  This is $BadMike's job.  He has to be the one to handle it.  
>  
>**$Me**: (getting the hint but not acceding to it) If this is $BadMike's job, then *I will do everything I need to in order to make sure the data we use is accurate*.

Y'all, understand what was transpiring here.  By this point, we had firmly established something called a ""spatial data warehouse.""  This was an authoritative repository of GIS data that we could use in our projects, ready-made and immediately useable.  *ALL* of our projects hinged on the reliability and accuracy of this information.  As you've read about in some of my previous posts, I had already been burned by accuracy problems in the past.  It had nearly cost me my job.  What **$DragonLady** had just told me was that we were committing the fundamental underpinning of our *entire team* to the most useless, incompetent, lazy, and least capable employee we had on staff.  Dear Christ, the panic that built in my mind.  My hands are shaking now just from typing this.

I resolved that, no matter what, I would not let this affect the quality of our products.  If I couldn't do the data updates, *you bet your a$$ that I could check them*.  And I would point out every minute mistake I found as loudly as I could to anyone that would listen.

Predictably, we had problems with **$BadMike**'s updates right from the beginning.  To give some perspective, at the time we performed our updates by first editing a particular feature, then placing the updated feature in an output geodatabase for use (adding a date stamp for when it was updated such as ""McDonalds\_Restaurants\_01012021""), and then archiving the older version.  **$BadMike** didn't do any of this except for putting things in the output geodatabase.  Nothing had any dates on it, nothing older was ever archived, and the metadata for these features were left untouched.  I pointed this out immediately and asked that **$BadMike** correct these issues via email - cc'ing everyone in our chain of command when doing so.  **$BadMike** never once fixed anything, but at least I had laid out sufficient supplications before the altar of CYA.  In short order, we had multiple copies of the same data in our output geodatabases, each one spelled slightly differently, with none of them having a date stamp so we could know which was the most recent version.  Most of the archiving I did myself.

*But wait, there's more!*  Several of the datasets that **$BadMike** was updating were mission-critical.  It would really dox me to say what they were, but just know that these were incredibly important facilities where altering the location would mean dramatic differences in analysis.  In the past, we would simply refer to the older versions, make manual edits where warranted, and otherwise leave positions alone (since we had very accurate locational information to start with).  This wouldn't put the brakes on **$BadMike**, of course!  He put together a process to pull down the addresses for these features, ran them through a run-of-the-mill geocoder, then slapped the results into the output geodatabases without ever checking them.  Anyone ever dealt with a geocoder before?  Ever heard of a little thing called ""matching to ZIP Code centroid"" instead of to an address point or street centerline?  *How far away from the on-the-ground location do you expect that would f\*cking be?!?*  \>:(

I didn't trust these outputs from the very beginning so I did my own checks.  Turns out, the geocoder had misplaced tons of facilities.  *Say it ain't so!*  In some cases, the new locations were *miles* away from where they actually existed on the ground.  In one instance, the geocoder had misplaced the facility to the opposite side of a county - think ""100 West Highway 20"" versus ""100 East Highway 20.""  The resulting features were absolute piss-poor quality and we flat out couldn't use them.  As soon as I finished my checks, I sent emails to all of the team's management as well as **$BadMike** showing what the problems were and requested that we rebuild everything.

**$BadMike** then got pissed off and stalked over to me.  ""Why did you go over my head about this?  If you had just spoken to me directly, I could have cleaned all this up!""

I gave him a disdainful look (I even remember how far I lowered my eyelids) and just said, ""**$BadMike**, I've been telling you about these problems for weeks.  Nothing's changed.  We can't use what you produced.  We *have* to have updated, corrected data.  *Please* follow the procedures we built specifically for this and pay attention to what you've created.  There's a reason why we set all this up in the first place.""  **$BadMike** didn't respond to that and then trundled off.

Eventually, it got to the point where we really couldn't use anything **$BadMike** created at all.  Thankfully, **$DragonLady** and **$MrScott** rarely followed up with any of their grand proclamations.  We thus reverted back to a general schedule among the rest of the team where we updated things whenever we could, and I would check things to make sure they were ok.  Just like we'd done before **$BadMike** ever got involved.  \*shakes head\*  Everyone came to understand that if a data element didn't have a date stamp on it, **$BadMike** created it and we shouldn't use it.  Lol.

And as time continued on, relations between **$BadMike** and me/the rest of the team continued to deteriorate.  All of us continued to have issues with anything he did and it always made our lives harder.  Only **$DragonLady**'s and **$MrScott**'s indulgence seemed to keep him employed at all.  I cannot fathom what was going through **$BadMike**'s head during all this.  **$AwesomeRed** was actually able to give us some insights and they were puzzling to say the least.  Just to point out, **$AwesomeRed** was the ultimate diplomat.  She and her boyfriend would often have drinks with **$BadMike** and some of the other GIS team members after work.  During those outings, she told us that **$BadMike** would *constantly* hate on **$DragonLady** and **$MrScott**, telling everyone how incompetent they were, how difficult they were to work with, berating them, and so on.  What the actual f\*ck?!?  These two were literally the only people keeping him off the streets!  It's like he was dangling over a cauldron of boiling feces, and not finding the safety rope to his liking, *was trying to set it on fire!*

Things started to get heated between him and the rest of the GIS staff over time, too.  He was taking flak for his failures and was no longer able to pin the blame elsewhere.  I remember one instance where I was working on some things and **$AwesomeBoss** and **$MrScott** came into the office.  They beelined for his desk, upset over some analysis he'd screwed up.  He'd not used the correct data and messed up the parameters (even though he'd been given clear instructions).  After the bosses left, he turned to me with a sulky expression.  This was our conversation:

>**$BadMike**: $Me, you were sitting right here.  You heard them detail this project.  If you heard all this stuff about it, why didn't you say anything to me?  
>  
>**$Me**: (standing up from my desk to walk out) I didn't know the full details.  You were sent the information.  I was not involved in this, I may not have interpreted everything right.  
>  
>**$Me**: (I then stopped and turned back, suddenly very angry about this) But more importantly, it is not my job to keep tabs on what you are supposed to do.  You can write something down just as well as anybody else.  I have my own work to take care of.  I can't babysit you too.

He threw his hands up in the air while I stormed out.  *God*, you have no idea how cathartic it was to say this to that f\*cker.  I smiled the rest of the day :)

Finally, we got to the point where even the pretensions of civility broke down.  **$BadMike** and me were put on separate projects in the early part of the new year, each with a month deadline.  I finished mine after a few weeks and moved on to other tasks.  **$BadMike** was still struggling in the last week that he had to work on the project, so **$DragonLady** asked me if I'd create a series of template maps for him to use.  This really wouldn't take much time, so I did so.  At the end of the week, just before the deadline, his project was still not completed.  We had a meeting between **$Me**, **$BadMike**, **$DragonLady**, **$MrScott**, and **$AwesomeBoss**.  In that meeting, a very agitated **$DragonLady** asked why on earth this hadn't been wrapped up.  I simply said that I'd produced everything that was asked of me (and I had, there was no question about that at all).  **$BadMike** then proceeded to go into a petulant rage, saying that the templates I'd created weren't suitable and that I was the reason he wasn't able to complete the project.  For those of you familiar with GIS, what he complained about was that I had converted the dynamic legends to static graphics - a minor design change that gave us more cartographic control (and was a best practice at the time) and may have caused him to put in an additional *10 minutes* *of effort*.  What a f\*cking crime.  This was literally the only reason he gave for not finishing.  I simply crossed my arms, held a disgusted expression on my face, and refused to look at him for the rest of the conversation.  After a few minutes, my bosses asked me to leave.

I was very angry after this.  Like, angrier than I'd ever been before in a professional context.  And I felt that I didn't deserve it, either.  So I did something I'd never ever done, neither before nor since.  I went back to my desk and wrote up a formal complaint against **$BadMike**.  Whenever **$DragonLady** returned to her office later (**$BadMike** didn't come back that day), I knocked on her door and asked to speak with her.

She let me.  I gave her the complaint.  I told her that I did not feel like I deserved to have been spoken to like that.  I told her that I felt like we were having constant issues out of **$BadMike** and we needed them to stop.  And I asked her to please light a fire under his a$$hole and *make him do his job!*  She told me that she understood.  She said that management had noticed a severe deterioration in **$BadMike**'s work quality and that they were taking steps to correct it, up to and including his departure from **$Agency** if need be.  I nodded and thanked her for her time.  I didn't really expect anything of it.  But I felt like I needed to say something - I wouldn't just let all this slide.

At this point, the ball was in **$DragonLady**'s court.  Would she actually do what she said and hold **$BadMike** accountable for his actions?  Or would this just another current in the river of bullsh\*t we'd all been wading through these past many years?

You'll have to wait until tomorrow to find out.  See y'all then, everybody! :)

205,"Will do it somehow, if you don't","2nd/3rd level support for Exchange here. Was doing support for a very big company for emails (only english language as communication).

Got a ticket from one branch in Brasile, where user wanted us to change the email folder, where emails are received to his local (Outlook) folder. I was like, hmm, probably he thinks, we will not be able to access his emails or something similar. So with short talk with my manager, we provided a nice reply to the ticket with reasons why we refuse it and closed the ticket.

Month later, we got a ticket with only simple messsage ""User is not receiving any emails"". As the ticket was created on behalf of person having the issue, we had to call back. So we called the requestor ... 


Me: Hello, I am from xxx and we received a ticket from you.

Her: Hello,  yes, wait ... [hearing a run and a lot of whispers]

Me: OK [waiting...] 

Her: Yes [someone else]

Me: We received a ticket with number xxx with this issue

Her: Yes

Me: Could you please tell us more about it and also who is affected?

Her: Yes, wait

Me: OK [hearing clicking]

Her: We update the ticket later

Me: OK, will wait

...
After few days, we finally got update on the ticket. And yes, it was the person that wanted to change the  Inbox in mailbox. So we did backup of it and run check-mailbox tool. Check-tool found some problems related to Inbox and created a new Inbox folder, but new emails were still missing. Asked my manager, if I can have a look on it. So interested, I found with mapi editor some hidden emails from few days ago. So I told about it to my manager and he told me to be quiet. That user caused it himself, we have backup and that we will tell him, it is corrupted and lost.

206,I'm going deaf and it's your fault,"Not as glamorous as some of you folks, but...

Scene: Tech support for cable TV/phone

Year: 2010-ish

>Me: <greeting>

>Customer: Hi my name is Jane Doe, name on the account is John Doe, the volume on my TV is too low.

This is really just customer education. The cable box has it's own volume controls in addition to the TV's volume, so having the box set to a low volume could make it overall too quiet. Most customers aren't even aware of this since it's hidden, but somehow it gets changed every now and then. In addition, there's also the language/SAP/DVS/MTS settings that need checked, since broadcasters do all kinds of shenanigans with their broadcasts on the 2nd and up audio track that make no sense, like lowering the volume, or just muting everything but the laugh tracks, so there's nothing obvious to say that you're on the wrong audio setting either. Plus the labeling of the audio settings don't help either, having it set to Spanish, but still hear English...

But in order to tell the customer how to check those, I need to pull up the account and see what equipment they have so I can give proper directions to navigate the menus.

>Me: OK so I see you chose not to enter any account info into our IVR, and my caller ID says anonymous, so can you give me your phone number so I can see your equipment?

>Customer: *sigh* 123-555-1234

>Me: That doesn't pull anything up, could it be under another?

>Customer: *heavier sigh* 123-555-1234

>Me: That's the same phone number. 

>Customer: (YELLING) I DON'T KNOW, WHAT DO YOU WANT?

>Me: How about the street address?

>Customer: (quickly) 1234 WeirdstreetnamethatIcan'tspell

>Me: Can you spell that street name please?

>Customer: (another heavy sigh, then customer quickly spells it so fast I barely keep up) WHY DO I NEED TO DO THIS WHY CAN'T YOU HELP ME?

After taking a few guesses at the spelling of the street name...

>Me: OK I found your account, can you verify the last four of the SSN?

>Customer: 1234, damn it. Now help me already.

>Me: So on your remote, please press this button, and ---

>Customer: (hangs up)

Out of curiosity, I look at the notes on the account, and see that she called 3 other times about this and hung up on all the other agents too. So I actually call the customer back. I don't even hear it ring at all. I click the dial button and suddenly hear people talking to each other? But not to me. It catches me off guard, but I assume the customer was on their way to call us back and her finger was already on the way down to open the line when it started ringing.

>Me: Hello?

>Customer: Hello? Who is this?

>Me: This is $me with $company. We were talking a moment ago? I'm not sure why the call dropped, did you push the buttons I told you to and see <first menu> on your screen?

>Customer: Oh, I fixed it. (quickly hangs up)

A few hours later she calls back again gets another agent, and says the volume on her TV is too low again, and again hangs up on the agent.

A week or so passes uneventfully. 

She calls in again, gets routed to me again, and the call goes exactly the same, except the volume on her phone is too low this time. Again, it basically amounts to just customer education.

>Me: So your phone's volume is too low, are you getting interference on the phone line or something that's preventing you from hearing the other person?

>Customer: No, the volume is just too low.

>Me: Most phones have a volume button or knob you can use to adjust---

>Customer: (Hangs up)

Again, I look at the notes and see that she started reporting the volume on her phone was too low about an hour or so ago and already talked to several agents, and big surprise, she hung up on all those agents too.

TL;DR, customer going deaf, blames the technology, doesn't let anyone help her.",48,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF29B190>
207,I’m not “a computer person”…,"Another story from my datacenter days while running the Datacenter Applications Team.  One of the applications that we built and managed for datacenter use was the ticketing system, which had a built in CMDB.  Everything was in the CMDB from user accounts, customer accounts, billing, physical assets, etc.  When you create a service ticket, all the fields have to be populated with an CMDB record so it is rather important that the CMDB is correct.  Fucking HA!

Anyway, my team did not manage the CMDB – it just happened to be the DB our ticketing system used as a resource.  All CMDB updates/additions/removals was performed by the Datacenter Inventory team.  The specialist that performed this duty for years eventually flattened out the file to a flat CSV file – I didn’t give a shit.  I learned a long time ago that you cannot always get in everyone’s business, especially in a datacenter.  He would receive updates throughout the day and upload at COB.  Additionally, once a month, they would audit the floor.  The Inventory Team had handheld scanners and they would go through each zone, rack by rack, scanning each barcode – again to a CSV.  This would then get updated in the CMDB.  This guy had been doing this for 10 years or so.  And then he quit.

His replacement had actually been there for 15 years and worked under him.  She was an elderly lady and came off as very sweet.  Think of working with Grandma and she always brought cookies.  She was also always on a first-name basis with all the fat-heads running the place – again, nobody wants to be mean to Grams (unless you are a curmudgeon like me).  A few days after the old Inventory Lead left, I was sitting in the bullpen when I heard “the sound”.  If you are a team lead or a senior, you know what I am talking about.  It is the sound the T1/T2 engineers make when they get a bullshit ticket and start whispering, grunting and rooting around.  I had taken the desk closest to the door so that I could head off people trying to “engage” my team directly instead of through proper requests, and I heard the bullshit-ticket noise slowly growing in intensity as it made its way closer to the door.

I walked back to where the source was – Ticketing System Team.

>IT_curmudgeon:  OK, what’s going on.

> Team Member:  I just got a ticket telling me to update the CMDB daily.  We do not manage the CMDB, it is the responsibility of Inventory Team.

>IT_curmudgeon:  Assign the ticket to me, please.

A quick look at the request and it was a request from the “new” Inventory Team Lead to perform the nightly CMDB update with the .csv file they would provide.  This stuck me as odd for two reasons.  1 – this is the responsibility of the Inventory Team to do.  It is literally their job.  2 – we made it easy for them.  They had a simple application installed on their laptops where they just had to enter a username, password and name/location of the file to upload and then…click upload.  This was not a request to help with an error caused when uploading, which we do work on and support.  This was just them wanting us to do it from now on.

I picked up my phone and called the Inventory Lead.

>IT_curmudgeon:  Hey, what’s up with this ticket?

>Grandma Inventory:  I am having a problem updating the CMDB since the team member that used to do it is no longer here.

>IT_curmudgeon:  Oh, ok no problem.  I will send someone over to walk you through it.

>Grandma Inventory:  I already spoke with Engineer1.  He showed me the process but it seems complicated.  It would be easier if he just did it.  Quicker!

>IT_curmudgeon:  Well, yes, a lot of things would be easy for everyone if someone else did their work, but updating the CMDB falls outside the scope of my team’s responsibility.  I am not trying to be confrontational, but it is your team’s job to do this.  

>Grandma Inventory:  (sweet grandma voice)  Yes, but I am not that good with computers!  Haha!

>IT_curmudgeon:  You run the Inventory Team at a datacenter!  How can you not “be good with computers”?  Look, this is a simple process.  Reading your email is harder than this.  If you can dial a phone you can do this.  I’ll send Engineer2 over to show you the process again.

>Grandma Inventory:  (evil grandma voice)  Well, I’ll just bring it up with Kate!  (Kate = fake name of the current datacenter manager over all teams).

>IT_curmudgeon:  OK ::click::

Queue the back-and-forth emails between myself, evil Grandma and the DCM.  Eventually the DCM got frustrated and we were both ordered to present ourselves in the conference room to explain ourselves and demonstrate the issues.  I walked to the back of the bullpen and grabbed Engineer6 (the new guy that had been there a week) and explained to him that he is going to demonstrate to management how to update the CMDB.  His face goes white and he asks me “what is a CMDB”.  I did feel somewhat bad and told him not to worry.  It is easy, I will explain it when the time comes.  I just wanted him because he was new here and knows fuck-all and that was my only requirement.

We got to the conference room and everyone was waiting.  The new SDM looking pissed and annoyed, Grandma sitting in her sweater smiling sweetly with, and I am not shitting you, a plate of fucking cookies in front of her.  I told fuck-all to sit at the head and plug his laptop into the overhead, open his email and find the email I sent before we left with a copy of the CMDB update attached, save it to his desktop, click THAT application, enter your creds, point to the file you just saved to your desktop and click OK.  This took like…a minute.  The whole room was quiet as the slidebar crept across the screen and the laptop went “DING!” with the displayed “Upload Completed.  Do you wish to integrate into CMDB?  YES/NO”.  He looked at me.  I looked at him.  I scanned the room and locked eyes with the SDM.  Then looked at Grams.  I wanted SOOOO bad to grab a cookie and then tell fuck-all to click “YES”, but I contained myself.  The SDM was still looking pissed.  I told fuck-all to click “YES”, which he did expertly.  “CMDB updated” flashed across the screen.  I patiently waited for a response from the SDM.

I could tell that she was conflicted.  She liked Granny and her cookies.  And I know she did not care for me – the name “IT_curmudgeon” was given to me by others, and legitimately earned.  But I usually get away with it because I do the damn job well, even if I don’t play well with others outside my team.  I had proved my point that even brand new fresh-faced fuck-all new to the industry could do this.  If he can do it, the Inventory Manager who had been on that datacenter team for 15+ years should be able to do it.  Especially since it is her actual job.

The result was as I expected.  Grandma will be performing the update of the CMDB and I was required to apologize for me calling her out on her bullshit.  The SDM left the room, cookie in hand, and I went back to my office pissed.  I hate when I have to apologize for being right.",38,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF29B1F0>
208,We have people for that,"So this happened a few years back. A smaller location with about 10 employees all in an office setting were being moved out of their office building to a smaller temporary office building so the original building could be repaired due to some damage. They would need to be in the temporary building for about 2 months.

I and my 3 person (at the time) IT staff was located in another town about 45 minutes away, but we were responsible for this location as well. The big wigs from corporate stepped in and said they had everything under control regarding the temporary office and the renovation. Being a good manager I started asking questions about how would the LAN be rebuilt, has cable modem been scheduled to be installed, and has someone scheduled IT movers to move their computers and other equipment over. I was told ""Yes, everything is being taken care of and we have people for all of that. You will not have to do anything but keep on supporting them.""

5 days before the move the Regional Manager calls me and say so what is happening with the network at the new place, we got the keys, but corporate says you're building everything out. (So I guess we are the ""people for all of that"".) After a few phone calls (including the manager who said they had it under control) it was confirmed that we (the local IT staff) were to handle the scheduling of the cable modem move, assisting corporate with the router reinstallation, LAN rebuild, and moving all of the user's IT equipment.

Turns out the Project manager was so focused on the reconstruction of the old site they completely forgot about the needs for the temporary site and did not remember our conversation asking those exact questions. At the last week, they just called the regional manager and said we (local IT) would handle everything.",25,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF29B250>
209,Less than three is in the air,"This tale takes place more than two decades ago, when the phones were still dumb and the discourse on social media was still smart. Geocities was still under construction and MySpace didn't even exist yet.

I had just left my small hometown behind and started college in a big city, where I learned that there *is* an upper limit to how much ice cream one man should eat in one sitting and that total anonymity is not enough to escape the legacy of being ""the computer guy.""

One night I was hanging out with a few friends, getting my ass kicked at Marvel vs Capcom by a girl whose strategy was essentially ""mash ALL the buttons!""  Lemme tell ya, it stings just a bit to keep losing to someone like that. Still does, in fact.

Anyway, the night went on and we all started discussing our school life. It turned out the girl who'd been kicking my ass for the last hour was having computer troubles and needed to get an assignment delivered to a professor by the end of the week. 

""I can help with that!"" I blurted out. *Damn it, my cover as a normal human is blown.*

""Really?"" she said. ""That'd be great! Come fix it tomorrow afternoon and I'll send you home with some food.""  I had been tutoring in exchange for home-cooked meals for some time by this point. It's a great way to meet people and not starve, and most of the people I knew didn't have much cash either so everybody won.

So the next day I visited her house, turned on the computer and heard an awful grinding noise from the CD burner.

""Has it *always* been possessed?""

""No, this is new.""

""Ah, well, it looks like you'll need a replacement.""

Although I don't remember why anymore, I knew she needed that drive operational ASAP so I took her down to the local computer shop.  I spoke the language of IT and managed to get her a deal on a 4x burner (*slaps top of box* ""This bad boy can burn so much data!""). Back at her place I installed the drive and saved the day, netting me a big hug and many thanks.

As I was putting my screwdriver back in my bag she turned to me. ""Hey, do you uh, want to go out for dinner?""

To this day, there is exactly one person in this world whose computer I don't mind fixing.

210,The reoccurring dead circuit..,"After retiring from the army, I got a job working for a logistics company doing IT. It's a small-medium company that has multiple warehouses. One of the warehouses is remote and has it's own DSL connection and VPN back to the main office.  It's an old warehouse with an old 100 pair lead-cased cable feeding the building. Each pair is wrapped in paper (that's how old this cable is).  When it rained, the DSL would go out. I'd call and put a work order in and it'd get fixed within a day. On work-order #3, I go out to the warehouse to talk with the lineman performing the work. The lineman tells me the cable is shot and that he jumpered the last good pair of wires and that I needed to call in a work order. It's July, I call a work order in and think that it's been replaced. Oh nooo.. It was not. February.  We had a warm day and back to -10 F temps. The DSL goes out again. I call in a work order. I ask for the  work order number and get it. Suspecting I got the blow off, I call the next day to ask what the status of the work order was. I was told it was canceled. OK, I open another and get the number. I call the next day to get the status. Canceled. 

telco- Your work order is canceled. 

me- This will be work order #3. 

telco- sir, you can put in another work order..

me- naaa. I'm done with that. WHO canceled the order?

telco- Mike the foreman.

me- OK. I'd like to talk with ""mike"".

(puts me on hold and transfers me)

Mike- Mike speaking (sounds like a bully)

me- hi Mike.. I'm calling to ask why my work orders are being canceled.

Mike- We just don't have time for that.

me- Ok Mfer. This just became a one-sided conversation. I put in 3 work orders to get this cable fixed, you fucking blew me off 3 times. I bet if this cable connected your home, I guarren-goddamn-tee you that there would be two bucket trucks, a cable truck and 8 guys on site to fix it because it goes to your house. Instead of doing the work in July when it was nice outside, you fuckers are going to be doing it in the snow and blow. Either you do the fucking work or the next trip is going to be using the ""open door"" policy of your company's CEO to let him know how much a shit job ""mike"" is doing. Got it, Mike?

Mike- We'll be there at 8:45 tomorrow morning. (you can hear he's pissed)

8:30 the next morning I show up. They're already there (surprise surprise). Two bucket trucks, a cable truck, 8 guys and ""mike"".

""Mike"" walks over..

Mike- you Mr. Bilco?

me- Yes (Mike is sizing me up, I give mike ""take your best shot, because I'll lay your ass out"" look)

Mike- we're not replacing it with 100 pair, we're installing 25 pair. That's the best we can do.

me- I don't give a shit. I just want two pairs that work.

He walks off to supervise.

The lineman that's going to punch the wire onto the DMARC asks where it is, I take him up there.. He tells me that cable should've been replaced long ago. There was a crack in the lead sheathing. Water was seeping in and smoking the circuits.",18,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF29B310>
211,"Sometimes, my users just make... sad"," I work in application maintenance. My main tasks are restarting stuck processes, fixing errors in the data, and analysing errors. I work on tickets opened by the application's users. Typical stuff.

One type of thing the users can ask me sometimes is to downgrade a certain type of object. Now unlike my other taks, for this one I need a special authorization, that can only be given by a small handful of people. That's because downgrading one of those objects can cut off my client's customers from the service my client provides, so someone with the necessary know-how must check if it's actually okay to do it.

So this morning I get a ticket, asking me to downgrade one such object. There is an attachment to the ticket ; normally this would be the authorization I require, so I check it out.

The attachment is an excel file, in which they pasted a screenshot of the text ""I authorize the downgrade of the object"". That's it. No name given, and the object isn't explicitely identified. Just the two sentences. I don't know if they're genuinely this incompetent, or if they thought it would fool me... I don't know which is worse, either.

212,A sticky situation,"Just remembered an unfortunate tale that could have easily been avoided, but as you shall see.....

&#x200B;

Cast:  
$ME - yours truly  
$ITDirector - Boss who definitely didnt need to be in that role, but I digress  
$SysAdmin - Great guy, knowledgeable, could sniff out BS but wouldnt call it out publically  
$SupportEng - Sarcastic a-hole, attempted to act like my boss, would shift blame whenever he could  
$PoorSoul - The end user who killed his laptop  


Preface: I used to work for a small company (step above a startup, but still considered a small/medium business) that had massive growth since their start.  A lot of the first employees were still there and made sure that was known.  This place at times felt like a typical day of high school.  Very clique-ish, cut-throat and childish behavior.  I worked here as part time IT (with borderline full time hours) and when I was hired, it was a tightly run ship.  IT director was pretty much there part time while the Senior SysAdmin and Senior Support Engineer covered 95% of the gaps.    
After the IT director left, the Senior SysAdmin was named the new IT director (mistake #1), we hired a new SysAdmin and Senior Support Engineer was also doing sysadmin type work.  Company was still going thru massive growth and at one point was even talking expansion, however one fateful summer the person in charge of the new expansion immediately quit and a few months later 3 people were laid off.  Looks like the company took a gamble and lost big time  


The rollout: During this bit of chaos, IT got the approval to perform a laptop refresh.  The equipment that we were using was easily 6 years old and had taken a lot of abuse.  Laptops were often dropped, scuffed, mishandled, executed (1 VP managed to execute his laptop every Christmas) and it was difficult to keep up with the mess that we had.  Every full timer was going to get a new laptop, keyboard, mouse, docking station and monitors.  It was a major undertaking but after a few bumps we were able to get things going and finished the rollout.  During one team meeting, I heard that while the rollout was a success, some corners had to be cut.  Now being the sole part timer, I was not allowed to know why (this was an issue since day 1 working there, I was typically excluded from meetings, info, etc).  I didnt dig into it and just figured with new equipment, people would be happy and we didnt have to deal with crappy equipment again.    


The event:  
One evening, I was wrapping up and about to head out for the weekend when all of a sudden i get the call from 3 cubicles down  


$PoorSoul - Hey Icebear, can you come over here for a few?  
$Me - Whats going on?  
$PoorSoul - So I was eating breakfast at my desk  
$Me (internally - ""O no"") Go on  
$PoorSoul - And I may have spilled some syrup on my laptop  


There was some evidence of syrup on the laptop, but it was still functional.    
$Me - OK, lets get your documents saved and turn this thing off.  And then i can get you setup with an old laptop until we figure out what to do  
$PoorSoul - Dont worry about that, I'll just use a desktop I have  
$Me - Fair enough

I take the laptop back, open a ticket in our system and give $SupportEng a heads up for Monday.  He gives a laugh and confirms we will deal with it Monday

&#x200B;

The Monday:   
I am first one in and am handling my usual tasks of taming all of the printers and feeding them the ink they desire.  Greedy bastards....err ANYWAY.  $SysAdmin comes in and I decide to bring him up to speed

$Me - Hey $SysAdmin, so unfortunately $PoorSoul may have broken his laptop  
$SyaAdmin - Geez already, what happened  
$Me - Claims he spilled syrup on it  
$SysAdmin - Good grief, and these things have no warranty  
$Me - They dont have what now???  
$SysAdmin - Oh yeah, $ITDirector couldnt afford the extended warranty, so these things just have the basic 1 year and thats it.  No accidental either.    
$Me - Well crap  


In comes $SupportEng  


$SupportEng - Hey guys, where's the laptop?  
I hand it to him, but then get pulled into a A/V setup for the executives.  Roughly 2 hours go by before I return (had to stay to make sure things ran smoothly)  


$SupportEng - So when did the keyboard stop working?  
$Me - Not sure, it was still functioning Friday after the accident (I figured the syrup was making it way thru the machine, it was only a matter of time)  
$SupportEng - Ok, lets chat with $ITDirector  
\*during our Monday meeting\*  
$ITDirector - So $PoorSoul spilled syrup on his machine?  
$Me - yup  
$ITDirector - Can I see the laptop?  


By this time, the machine will not turn on, it has met its fate  


$ITDirector - Ok, here what we will do.  Open a case with the vendor, tell them the machine will not power on.  Theres no physical evidence of syrup, so maybe they will just fix it and send it back  
$Me - Do we have any warranty on these things?  
$SupportEng - \*Laughs\* Nope, none at all  
$ITDirector - We had to skip a few things to stay within budget.  Just get this done and let me know of the status.    


I left the office disgusted.  No sane person would have made that deal without the warranty, especially given past behavior.  Way too much of a gamble to take, but yet here we are.  I put in the claim, sent the laptop out and a few weeks later the vendor came back with their findings.  Of course they found the syrup, so there goes any chance of free repair.  I believe the repair bill totaled $532 to replace the motherboard and battery.  It was still under the cost of the laptop, but management decided not to proceed with the repair.  

&#x200B;

Epilogue: After that event, I lasted another 3 months before giving my 4 days notice.  I had received an offer for my current job and filled out the paperwork and had a start date.  After I left, things just kept getting worse.  Both $SysAdmin and $SupportEng left the team, so $ITDirector had to quicky hire some part timers to fill in the gap.  A lot more people left the company and eventually the money basically ran dry and massive layoffs came.  As of today, the company is closed for good and NGL, im happy it is.  That place was a mess and this story was just one of the terrible IT moments.",9,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF29B3D0>
213,My computer is not working (or so you think user),"Hello all, this is my first post on reddit, I hope you will enjoy it. English is not my native language so I hope you will still understand it. 

In my company I am a software developper / software engineer (this depends on who is calling me) in a team of 2.

Because I am the software developer, of course I am the only guy in the company who knows anything about computers so I also have to solve all the IT problems.

One day my manager came to told me that a newly hired in the company will arrive the next day (as always we know that someone will arrive only the day before, it would be too easy otherwise, thank you HR).

I took a computer in my old computer stash (due to the microchip shortage and the will of the company to spend money on new hardware, the best computers I have are 5 years old laptops) and set it up so everything will be ready for the new guy coming.

The day after I was working on a complex problem in one of our software and the new hired came, interrupting me in the middle of a 1 hour reflexion about the software bug and told me ""my computer isn't working"". I was quite surprised because I tested the computer the day before so I had to stand up from my chair and walk to his desk (it is too hard for the users to bring the laptop with them when they have an issue).

I arrived at his desk and saw the computer, with the ethernet cable, mouse, keyboard and display plugged in. Quite surprisingly the ethernet lights were blinking and the display showing the windows logging screen. And here is what happened:

f222: ""Well it looks like your computer is working, can you log in?""
User: ""No it's not working""
f222: ""Can you try to log into the computer""
User: *starts to type its login information*
f222: *turns my head away so I won't see the password he is typing*
User: ""You see it is not working!""
f222: *turns my head back at the screen and see the invalid password message* ""well it seems there is an issue with your password, are you sure you typed in the right password""
User: ""Yes, but the computer is not working and when I type the password the blinking thingy goes back and forth""
f222: *thinks about what a blinking thingy can be (it was the text cursor), looks at the computer's keyboard and presses the num lock key* ""Can you try again to type your password""
User: *types his password* ""Oh it is working now""
f222: *points at the numlock light* ""when you try to enter your password, or a number from your computer, please ensure that light is on. If it is not press the numLock key and everything should work""

And this is how I was cut in the middle of a complex bug solving just because a user did not press the numLock key on his keyboard.

Please users if you have an issue, describe it instead of saying ""my computer is not working"". And also, please try to think 2 seconds about your issue before going to IT...",37,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF29B430>
214,People do what they are inspected to do.,"I was working as in independent contractor for a Big Bank. Someone got the brilliant idea that it would be better to outsource all of IT to a Big Tech company.  Everyone was guaranteed a job with Big Tech for 1 year. However they lost all of the perks of being an employee of Big Bank. No more annual bonus, generous 401(k) match, heavily subsidized health insurance etc etc. 

They also knew that their days were numbered. Big Tech had a well earned reputation for moving jobs offshore, or replacing long serving (old) employees with younger, cheaper ones.  The people who had been out sourced had no love for the Big Bank. 

Big Bank moved some of their people into a new office area and we set them up with access to the mainframe. About a week after they were in place I got a problem ticket.  The user reported that  every hour, on the hour all the terminals in their new area just stopped.  After 30 seconds everything resumed.   

I investigated and found that when the communications line was set up, someone mis-configured it. The box at their end was gathering diagnostic data. Every hour it would report this up stream and wait for a reply. Unfortunately the box at the other end was not configured to accept this data so it never sent the acknowledgement.  After 30 seconds the remote box gave up waiting and went back to work.  

The fix was simple.  I just shut off the data collection feature,  but to implement it I would have to turn the box off and on.  Of course that would knock everyone in the area offline. 

Prior to the outsourcing if this had happened I would have called the user, told her what the problem was and arranged a convenient time to walk over, unplug the box, wait a minute and plug it back in. 

But one of the features of this outsourcing contract was a stack of SLAs (Service Level Agreements).  Among them were acceptable levels of response time and availability. 

Failure to meet the response time and availability levels would result in financial penalties to Big Tech and more importantly a black mark on my manager’s record. Not good if he expected to keep his job with Big Tech. 

So I took the problem to him.  He saw that even with this regular 30 second hang, we were still meeting the response time objectives. But knocking all those users offline would be reported  as an outage.  He told me to do nothing now, but add a task to recycle that remote box to the list of items for the next regular maintenance outage. 

I closed the problem ticket with a comment that the problem would be fixed in about 6 months.  I got a gold star for closing the problem so quickly,  No financial penalty for Big Tech.  No black mark for my boss. Everyone was happy. Except of course those users who had to endure this lousy service.",10,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF29B490>
215,How to get wrecked by your Service Delivery Manager and Help Desk,"I am currently a senior level IT Specialist working on non-public systems.  I have hopped around a myriad of contracts over the years.  This particular story comes from over 10 years ago when I was the “Datacenter Applications Lead” and ran a 12-person engineering team that managed all of the applications that controlled a major datacenter.  Everything from Data Mining/Discovery, Outage Monitoring/Alerts, Ticketing System, Automation Infrastructure, Inventory/CMDB, etc.  My team didn’t really use these tools, other than the ticketing system, so much as we built and configured them (Architecture and DevOps) and then passed them off to Ops.  We were only engaged when there was a problem with the tool itself, or a request came in to add functionality for the users, which were all of the other IT engineers/techs that worked at the datacenter.


This story comes at a time when the SDM (Service Delivery Manager) was getting wrecked by the “datacenter owner” over outages.  They owned the datacenter – my company ran the datacenter on their behalf.  The owner (who spoke on behalf of all of the customers) was stating that outages were not being properly reported so that SLA requirements could be avoided.  The owner had a very valid point because that is what was exactly happening.  I was approached by the SDM where he wanted to know of a solution to this.  I explained to him that the issue was really more of a policy-related issue and that if you do not enforce your policies on how outage alerts are handled, and make some examples of people that skirt those policies, then the issue will never be resolved.  How it was working at that time is that if an alert blew on the monitoring system, it would generate an alert in the monitor console, which was viewed by the 24/7 EOC.  They would perform T1 triage and generate a service ticket in the ticketing system.  They would then either perform corrective action if they could, or assign the ticket to the T2 team for resolution.  The type of outage and type of system having the outage determined what SLA was bound to it and the outage had to be resolved before the SLA timer ran out – or we lost money.  What some engineers were doing was closing the ticket before the SLA expired and forgetting about it, or immediately opening up a new ticket over and over again to beat the SLA timers.


What I proposed was to link the ticketing system and the monitor system together so that the monitoring system was the entity that actually created the ticketing system ticket, remove all ability for anyone to close those tickets, and have the tickets auto-resolve once the alert cleared in the monitoring system.  Basically, server has X issue caught by monitor – monitor opens ticket and assigns directly to 24/7 T1, T1 triage and issue is worked.  Once the issue is resolved, the alert will go green on the next polling cycle resulting in the monitoring system contacting the ticketing system and resolving the ticket.  End product is that nobody can close these tickets unless they fix the problem, and they better fix it before the SLA expires.  This would also result in those that normally try to skirt the system being unable to hide.


The SDM agreed to the proposal and it wasn’t a really huge build as both the ticketing system and monitoring system were built by the same vendor.  A few calls and a couple of weeks and we had it set up and ready to test.  And here is where things went off the rails and I became the most hated engineer for a week.  I proposed a slow rollout starting with one of the internal datacenter group assets being monitored, but the SDM just wanted to flip the whole thing to the ON position.  I don’t like doing that.  It had tested well in the dev pipeline, but this was production and…well…you fucking know how that goes.  I had also had my engineers take a quick look at there were hundreds of active alerts.  This was going to be a problem since every one of those was going to result in an SLA-bound ticket.  I had no means to determine the validity of the alert – my team set up/modified/removed alerts as requested.  We did not work outages.  He was adamant due to the customer breathing down his neck.  The conversation went something like this:

>IT_curmudgeon:  We should turn this on in stages.  There are a lot of alerts that are either being currently worked on or are silenced.  I don’t know why there are so many, but that is going to be an issue.

>SDM:  It’s not a problem.  This is what the customer wants.  We have to give him what he wants.  We will just deal with any alerts that pop up.  Not a big deal.

>IT_curmudgeon:  We can do that, but let’s do it in stages.  At least let us turn it on in a few enclaves first, see what issues crop up to ensure the process is sound and then push out to enterprise.

>SDM:  I told the customer I would have this up by the end of the day.  Just flip the switch and stop worrying about the small things.

>IT_curmudgeon:  You got it boss.

You see, what nobody knew is that the night shift help desk was comprised of a small handful of…I don’t know if they are fools, just lazy, incompetent or a combination of all three.  It became clear after some research that well over 500 monitors had been silenced/hidden by the help desk.  IT never seemed like a lot when you have over 100K active working monitors.  A good portion of these were from systems that were decommissioned or were in various stages of buildout.  It was apparently easier for the Project Teams and Help Desk to just hide/silence alerts instead of making a ticket to have the alerts removed.  But also, multiple nodes in quite a few clusters had gone down, blew an alert, night shift Help Desk checked the app and saw that it was working and just…silenced and hid the alarm.  I walked back to my team’s bullpen, told them to forward all their phones to my cell and said, “Light the fuse”.  I then pulled my chair right up to the door to the bullpen blocking anyone from entering.  


We had at least 500 alarms going off, the majority of them PING alerts, that had SLA timers of anywhere from 15 minutes to 4 hours.  The EOC dashboard, up on a dozen massive wall-mounted displays, looked like that scene from War Games.  You could see quickly flashing red lights coming from under the EOC door from the hallway – like some sick, demented, holiday festival – complete with wails of fear, anger and sadness.  My phone immediately lost its shit on my hip and I had to body-block managers from my bullpen full of engineers.  I explained what was going on and no, the monitoring system was not broken.  No, you cannot just “shut it off”.  Yes, I knew this would happen.  Go speak to the SDM.  Every phone belonging to an engineer – on-duty, on-call or off work – rang.  Since I was part of that team from before, that just meant more phones calls for me, where 95% of them went like this:

>IT_curmudgeon’s phone: RING RING

>IT_curmudgeon:  IT_curmudgeon here.

>IT Engineer:  WHAT THE F-

>IT_curmudgeon’s phone:  *CLICK*    

I think after everything was said and done, only like 5% of the alerts were actual real alerts – but they all broke their SLA.  The rest were mainly systems that were no longer around but nobody had requested to be removed from active monitoring.  I was initially blamed for the “issue of having an excess of decommissioned systems being actively monitored” but I told them point-blank that myself nor my engineers are their trashmen.  We get a request to set up a monitor, modify a monitor or remove a monitor.  We do not watch for alerts.  There were well north of 100K monitors set up, including enclaves in various stages of buildout.  My old team hated me and my team for a week, but when they found out the real cause of the “incident”, they understood.  They were still not happy, although they did get OT out of it.


I think after the dust settled, several help desk agents and at least one senior tech was shown the door.  They didn’t bust any SLA’s the entire time I was there after that.  The SDM moved on less than a year later.  I moved on out of team management and back to engineering on a new contract a year later.",26,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF29B4F0>

I work at level 1 helpdesk, and start at the same time every morning, as every other employee (minus the odd person). I usually come to work just a few minutes early to brace myself. I showed up the other day a few minutes early, and saw someone with a laptop poking around my desk, but figured they were just looking for someone. I grabbed a drink and came back to her standing there waiting for me, 10 minutes before I start. She claimed to have been messaging me, and didn't know why I wasn't around. The issue was the computer wouldn't start. I just looked over at her, saw the lights on and said ""it's already on though"". She opened the computer and sgned in, and swore it wouldn't work before and walked off. I then got to take my jacket off, relax for a few and start the day.

I had a quick chuckle about this, and decided I might start showing up right on time from now on lol.",135,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF29B550>
217,High Priority Ticket over a black screen,"This week it's my turn with the on-call duty. I work in the CCTV field.   
Todays morning at 6:55 i got a P1 ticket. (highest possible issue)  
Very strikt SLA with short reply and fixing times... yada yada 

  
Issue: ""User reported he has 3 black screens and doesn't see any camera image.""  
I got on my phone call the Layer 8, he explained all screens are black since yesterday and they can't work because they don't see shit and so on.  
I looked up in our CCTV Management System and saw all 3 screens are online and the status colour is green.  
Which is odd, because this means it is just online but nothing is connected to the screen otherwise the status colour would be black.

So I took a camera and drag & drop it on one screen and voilà, the camera image is shown.  
I explained to the user that he need to connect some cameras with the screens if he wanna watch them and he should know this when he works with the system.  
He said he doesn't care, he just wanna watch the Images and don't wanna do this ""tech stuff"".

Guess who wrote this time a very detailed summary about this issue in the ticket response and mentioned that I recommend a user training.  
Oh and I marked the ticket with “charging his dept with my labor cost for this call“ so they must discuss it on the next meeting.

Edit: 
I replaced the „directing costs“ stuff with the explanation from /u/jbuckets44

218,The Agency: Part 3 - The Lawyer,"Hello everyone!  This is the next story in the saga of my time at **$Agency**, a sort of interlude, where we get to talk about the sack of sh\*t that was placed in charge of a related state department and the shenanigans that ensured therein.  All of this is from the best of my memory along with some personal records, but ultimately it is how I remember things.  There certainly can be some inaccuracies.  Also, I don't give permission for anyone else to use this.

TL/DR: Yeah, I don't do that.  Enjoy the story :)

Again, for context, I am not in IT; rather, I'm a GIS (Geographic Information Systems) professional.  This particular world is quite small, so I will do what I can to properly anonymize my tale.  For reference, during the course of these stories I was employed at a research agency affiliated with a major university.  Here is my Dramatis Personae:

* **$Me**: I wonder who this could be!
* **$Agency**: Research agency where I was working at the time.
* **$Acronym**: Related state department that was shedding personnel left and right.
* **$MrScott**: Very nice guy, very smart, and completely clueless as a manager.  Sort of my superior at this point.
* **$DragonLady**: The director of $Agency.  Brilliant, great fundraiser, and similarly terrible at managing people.
* **$FTW**: Previous operations manager.  Extremely cocky and confident... and surprisingly really awesome.  Left for greener pastures.  Used to work at $Acronym.
* **$AwesomeBoss**: Very awesome boss, very chill and approachable yet extremely competent.  Also used to work at $Acronym.
* **$TheLawyer**: The vindictive moron placed in charge of $Acronym.  Villian of this tale.

This is sort of a side story that occurred during the course of previous events at **$Agency**.  But it is compelling, frustrating, and ultimately triumphant (as well as one of my favorite stories), so I'll share it with you all :)

For some background, one of the state departments that my job worked rather closely with was one we'll call **$Acronym**.  **$Acronym** was responsible for a ton of data and information that we used as well as certain state regulations.  They had a lot of resources and personnel.  They also had some very well-developed GIS capabilities.  I'm certain that there were plenty of folks there that were R.I.P. - *Retired In Place* \- but by and large the department seemed to be humming along and was a major cornerstone for GIS in my state.

Obviously, if something is running well, then somebody needs to step in and f\*ck it all up.  After all, I'm sure that many of you IT folks will agree that the natural course of manglement thinking is ""*everything works fine, why are we paying so much for this?!*""  As a result, someone in the upper echelons of the political establishment of my state decided it was time to trim the fat from **$Acronym**.

Enter **$TheLawyer**.

For some context, prior to **$TheLawyer**'s entry, each of the previous directors of **$Acronym** had been someone with extensive experience in the discipline(s) regulated by them.  They had managed similar departments, had degrees in those disciplines, or in some other way were fundamentally tied to **$Acronym**'s goals and mission.

**$TheLawyer** was none of this.  As her name implies, she was a lawyer.  She had no clue as to what the department actually did and even less of an idea of how to manage it.  Her stated remit when she was appointed director was, literally, ""to clean house.""

And clean house she did.  If by ""*cleaning house*"" you mean setting charges, hunkering down in a bunker across town, pulling the trigger, then *nuking the crater just to be sure*.  Within short order, nobody's job was safe.  Entire teams were let go.  People with high pay, nearing retirement, grandfathered benefits, etc., were walked out the door.  **$FTW** and **$AwesomeBoss** told me later of the climate of fear that **$TheLawyer** induced throughout the organization.  They would come into work terrified that it would be their last day, learning from others who had been let go that day alone.  Staff members across **$Acronym** walled themselves away from others lest they be identified as ripe for the chopping block.  All this is bad enough, but **$TheLawyer**'s worst sin was that she had no f\*cking clue what anyone did and/or how critical the different teams were to the purpose of the organization.  She simply fired entire groups without fully realizing how this would impact operations.  Manglement at its finest! \*chef's kiss\*  Within this mess, the most competent and ambitious staff members saw the writing on the wall and started abandoning ship as quickly as they could find new jobs.

As you can imagine, this worked wonders for **$Acronym**'s productivity.  In effect, the department largely shut down.  Certain things were automated and continued on, but new development or routine projects ground to a halt.  **$TheLawyer**'s shenanigans would wind up causing irreparable damage to **$Acronym** that still hasn't been fully fixed, even today.  However, because of her idiocy, we wound up benefitting at my job due to all the talent that was leaving.  Two of the refugees we took in were **$FTW** and **$AwesomeBoss**.  **$Acronym**'s loss was to our agency's substantial gain.

After several months of those two working alongside me at **$Agency**, we started getting a number of high-profile projects from private companies and public institutions.  Part of this was **$DragonLady**'s personality - she was patently incapable of saying *no* to a project, even if we didn't have the resources in place to complete it.  For her, it was all about project grabs and increases in funding.  Anyways, we had a number of new things to do, and **$FTW** was determined to make sure we did a good job on them.

For whatever reason, around this same time **$TheLawyer** decided to take exception to the work we were doing and started showing her a$$ all over the place.  I got burned by her twice.  I spoke with my colleagues both then and later, and we really don't know what the h\*ll her problem was.  Some of us think that she saw **$Agency** as a competitor.  Clearly, it was her crusade to enhance the finances of **$Acronym**.  Since my agency was getting tons of new projects and funding, she probably wanted that to go to her department instead, and as a result was hellbent on discrediting us.  Others think she was just being vindictive; a ton of people from **$Acronym** had fled because of her to come work alongside us and she couldn't stand that.  Thus, she either wanted to punish **$Agency** (specifically, the ""traitors"" that had left), or she wanted to assuage her ego that the crisis she had instigated wasn't as bad as it had actually become.

Anyways, one of the first projects to come across my desk was a series of complicated GIS-based reports that utilized the most recently-released Census data.  I worked heavily with **$FTW** to make sure that everything was good on this, then turned it over to **$MrScott** for final review.

A few days later, **$MrScott** called me into his office.  I was a little ambivalent about this - normally I wouldn't speak with him in his office unless there was some kind of problem.  Well, turns out there was a problem.  The reports that I had sent had a conflicting date in the source notes.  Honestly, this was a legitimate mistake on my part (I should have paid more attention to the original template I was given).  However, the problem was one that had originally cropped up in the template's finicky source attributions and I hadn't thought of it as an issue.  **$MrScott** chastised me substantially about this - **$TheLawyer** had her people review these reports, found these issues, and called into question our credibility before the state legislature.  I tried to defend myself by saying that I had only followed the template I had been given - and I had provided the reports to **$MrScott** for his final review before they were sent out.  If there were any problems, why hadn't he brought them up with me then?  As you can imagine, **$MrScott** was manifestly incapable of accepting blame for the dereliction of his own responsibilities and was quite talented in passing the buck, so his response was something to the effect of, ""I don't have time to do quality reviews on our outputs.  That's your job.  Pay attention to what you're doing because this could cost us funding in the future.""

Ugh.  **$MrScott**'s attitude notwithstanding, I had gotten burned pretty hard by **$TheLawyer** here.  It seems that while she couldn't spend enough money to keep her own staff, she could spend *plenty* to have a team review our products for any inconsistencies.  Seriously, there must be a special place in H\*ll already lovingly crafted for her.  Given that I'd been heavily warned, I figured I had a giant glowing-red targeting reticule on my forehead by both my own employers as well as **$TheLawyer**.  I would have to tread lightly.  From that day forward, I was to double-check and triple-check every single product that came out of my office.  If there was anything that I thought was even remotely incorrect or could be misconstrued, I'd confirm it before sending it out.

It wouldn't take long for this to rear its ugly head again.  Towards the end of summer, **$FTW** and **$DragonLady** managed to secure a really awesome development project with a major private company.  It was a dynamic GIS product in a file format that could be easily used by just about anyone, and it showed local geographic characteristics around facilities owned by this company.  It was awesome, to be honest, and spawned a whole line of new products down the road.  Anyways, this first stab required a huge amount of development.  I worked intensively with **$FTW** and **$AwesomeBoss** on it and we had our first draft after about a month.  Part of the data used was information that had been provided to me by **$FTW**.  I didn't think to check this since it had been provided to me by one of my bosses.  That was... \*holds pinky finger to corner of mouth\* ...*a mistake*!

This product went out to the private company via the state legislature.  In the space of a single day, **$TheLawyer** was up in arms about an issue she'd discovered within it.  The problem?  One feature within the entire, massive product apparently had the *wrong date* on it.  The GIS data had been pulled down from **$Acronym**'s website on that particular date, but the GIS data itself hadn't actually been updated in over a year (since they didn't have enough staff to do so).  However, **$Acronym** also had a portal for non-GIS based data for this same type of information, and *that* data was current.  As such, we had presented information that had a discrepancy from the regulatory source.  Out of all the features within that product, she had managed to single out the only one that had an issue with it - *and it was only a problem because they hadn't updated their own f\*cking data on their website!!!  GAAH!*

**$TheLawyer** framed this as a complete failure on the part of **$Agency**, and apparently targeted me specifically in the process.  ***Yeah, Merry F\*ck You to you as well***.  She also stated that in continuing to have problems like this, our agency was unreliable, and as such should not win the contract put in place by the private company.  Despite **$DragonLady**'s best efforts, the private company went along with **$TheLawyer**'s assessment.  We lost the contract.  They decided to abandon the project altogether. >:(

Thankfully, **$FTW** stood up for me during this process and eventually **$DragonLady** did as well.  **$FTW** could see that the argument made by **$TheLawyer** was complete BS from the get-go.  And **$DragonLady** apparently came to believe that **$TheLawyer**'s accusations were not necessarily levied against me in particular - they were meant to discredit **$Agency** entirely.  As such, both of them started pushing back against **$TheLawyer** to defend their staff and our research.

If you thought I was paranoid about my work before, *you hadn't seen me afterwards*.  I continued to triple-check everything I did, but I also started checking sources for literally everything we used.  There wasn't a single thing that I didn't cross reference before using it.  I was *NOT* going to be burned again.  I felt like I was hanging on by a thread, sitting at the bottom of the ninth with two outs and two strikes - one more miss and I was done.  In truth, my paranoid attention to detail comes mostly from these experiences.  I was determined not to lose my job because I missed something again.  I think this has served me well in the time since :)

And thanks to my enhanced paranoia, we didn't have any more discernable problems that **$TheLawyer** could call us out on from that point forward.  Thank God for small miracles.  However, **$DragonLady** and **$TheLawyer** continued to duke it out in the state legislature, cage-match style, for several more months.  Eventually, at the end of the year, another major project cropped up.  The conflicts between our two organizations meant that the legislature decided to split the responsibilities between us.  **$Agency** would be responsible for creating a series of GIS-based reports, while **$Acronym** would need to produce some cartographic products illustrating everything.

Management entrusted me, once more, to get all this done.  And I did everything I could.  I checked every possible data source, every caveat, every bit of the analysis.  I probably quadruple-checked everything before I sent it off.  I didn't involve **$MrScott** in the process at all (it wasn't hard, we'd discovered that if we just avoided him he'd never follow-up and wouldn't throw a monkeywrench into things).  Everything I built was instead confirmed by **$FTW** and **$AwesomeBoss**.  When I felt that I'd done every bit of due diligence I could, I submitted the project to **$DragonLady**.  She was happy with the results as well.  We got everything turned in a week before the deadline.  The legislature liked it and **$TheLawyer** couldn't find any fault with it.  *Hooray!*

The night before the project was due, I got a call from **$DragonLady**.  She asked me to come into the office as she really needed me for something.  I said sure and headed up there.  When I got in, **$DragonLady** was positively beaming.  She told me that she just got off the phone with **$TheLawyer**.  Apparently, **$TheLawyer** had fired so many people at **$Acronym** that she had no one that could produce the maps necessary for their part of the project.  As such, she had called **$DragonLady** to see if our agency could produce these maps ""*as a favor to her*.""  **$DragonLady** wanted to know if I could go ahead and take care of this.  Y'know, me and **$DragonLady** had our issues with one another, but I could have hugged her right then :D

I got all the maps done for the entirety of **$Acronym**'s part of the project in about two hours.

The maps were provided to **$TheLawyer** without our agency mark on them and presented as **$Acronym**'s work.  But you can bet your a$$ that **$DragonLady** framed that piece of blackmail and had it with her at every subsequent encounter with **$TheLawyer**.  We never heard a peep out of her again for the rest of her tenure as director.

Which would shortly be coming to an end, btw.  You see, with **$TheLawyer** firing people left and right, numerous regulatory divisions were falling by the wayside and simply couldn't keep on top of their duties.  Shocking, I know.  Eventually, a major scandal occurred directly because of this.  **$TheLawyer** attempted to divert blame but her awfulness eventually caught up to her.  Two months after all that started, she was dismissed from her post.  *SurprisedPikachu.png*.  She had lasted a year and a half, one of the shortest tenures of any director at **$Acronym**.  Her legacy is a crippled department that is still trying to recover from the ruination she inflicted upon it.  Thankfully, she has not held a public position since.  She attempted to run for an elected office several years ago.  In a genuine sense of pride in the electorate of my state, they gave her the proverbial middle finger in the primary.  I don't know what she's doing now, and I don't care.

But I am not ashamed to say that there will always be a flame of spite burning in my heart for this terrible woman, and it has kept me warm on many a night :D

There are more stories from **$Agency**, of course.  But they will have to wait until tomorrow :)  Take care, y'all!

219,The case of the missing password reset prompt,"I just dealt with a ticket that I think I'll remember for quite some time, because it's both so very simple and also basically impossible to diagnose without seeing the screen yourself.

So we get a ticket from $problemuser: ""I came back from lunch and my laptop says my password expired and must be changed. I tried to change it and it doesn't work.""

Now, $problemuser has a lot of password issues. To the point where I have a granular password policy set up just for them which gives them 10 attempts to sign in before locking them out, instead of the usual 3 we have set for everyone else. I'm immediately suspicious.

So I ask ""What happens when you try to change your password at the password update dialog?""

""It says the password didn't match""

*Gotcha.* I'm thinking. *You typoed the password and need to do it again.*

Given that it's this user however, I send them a screenshot of the password reset dialog with instructions. ""Put in your old password here, your new password here, and retype your new password again.""

Which is when I get back a reply that just makes me go ""huh?""

""There's only two password prompts. One for an old password and one for a new password.""

My first thought? *Crap, they're being phished. That's not the windows password reset dialog.*

So I remote in to their machine to see what they're seeing, and no, it's not a phishing site. It's the windows password reset dialog with only two prompts. They enter their old password, enter a new password, then get told the passwords don't match...

That's when I noticed the scroll bar to the right of the dialog, nearly hidden in the background image.

""Hey $problemuser, could you scroll down for me?""

Behold, the last dialog appears.

The user had their screen set to 175% zoom, and it pushed the final prompt down below the bottom of the password dialog screen's view window.

Just a nice reminder that it's not *always* the user's fault.",79,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF29B670>
220,Quite a Catastrophe!,"We sell metalworking fluids.

Metalworking fluids are lubricants that are used in the manufacturing segment when they make components for various machines. Selecting the right fluid means overall increase in productivity and a decrease in rejected components being churned out.

Now, we are one of those brands that are quite expensive compared to the local stuff. But, as the saying goes, ""you get what you pay for.""

But that also means that many look at the price tag and not the end benefit.

This particular story happened about 10 years ago and involved one of our then recently acquired customers.

The account was quite big for us with a lot of potential for sales. We had stiff resistance from the maintenance manager who was being aided by the purchase manager. The one guy on our side and willing to try our stuff out was the production manager. But as it was 2 against 1, it was not we were at a stalemate.

Eventually, they got themselves a shiny new fancy expensive machine, and wouldn't you know it, our product was recommended by the OEM!

And so we get our first order from that company of two barrels.

Roughly a week after delivery, I get an irate call from the maintenance manager. Now, until that Friday, I have only heard of him and have seen him once or twice when I have visited the company. I think he felt that we were beneath him or something, the man refused to even acknowledge our presence in the past.

So Friday morning, this man has somehow got my number and has called me yelling at me because that new machine has stopped working, and apparently, according to him at least, it is all the fault of my product.

I attempt to try and diagnose the cause of his trouble, only to be yelled at some more and practically ordered to show up at their place and take care of the problem.

So fair enough, I, along with one other colleague go there.

It is a long drive to a remote area. As soon as we arrive, we are greeted by quite a welcoming party.

At the head is the maintenance manager, full of righteous anger and fury.

Gathered around him are two sales people representing the local competition, the purchase manager, the general manager of the unit, and a few assorted hangers-on. I also spot our friendly production manager in the background standing very quietly.

As soon as we are within earshot, the maintenance manager starts off with his tirade.

""Ah so you are the people selling this fancy overpriced cutting oil! Come down from your AC offices to teach us, have you?""

In my best customer service voice I say ""Sir, I am very sorry that this happened to you, can you please show us the machine?""

After a bit more posturing, we are marched through the whole unit, past many of the other older machines that the maintenance manager takes time to show us and point out how they all have been running with no problem whatsoever using the cheaper competitor product, while gesticulating at those two reps. He is basically gathering a nice crowd around him as he walks, revelling in the attention he has gained.

By the time we have reached the far end of the factory where the new machine is standing, it feels like the whole company is looking at us.

My colleague then takes over.

""Sir, have you checked the sump tank for contaminants?"" he asks. This is a standard enough question in our field, because cutting fluids generally tend to mix in with a lot of other lubricants. It is unavoidable and in fact some of the higher quality stuff (like ours) has additives that allow the fluid to separate from those contaminants easily.

""Of course I have!"" says the maintenance manager arrogantly. ""But you can check it for yourself, if you want. You won't find anything unusual there! I guarantee you, whatever is in that tank is there in the tanks of all the other machines! The only difference is your oil.""

So my colleague goes to the tank, everyone can see that the tank has not been closed fully. Still, no comments yet since that doesn't seem to be too out of order at the time.

As soon as the tank is opened up a bit more, a foul odour fills the immediate area. Still, not too out of the ordinary. Cutting oils and lubricants don't exactly smell nice. Although the odour was a little ... off.

Colleague peers into the depths of the tank, takes a rod that is hanging nearby and slowly fishes out the remains of a cat's corpse.

And by remains I mean remains. You don't have to be an expert in cat anatomy to know that parts of that poor kitty's body were missing and were still inside that tank.

Everyone recoiled at that sight almost at once. The maintenance manager, who up until that time was ranting about how overpriced we were and how bad our quality was stopped mid-sentence. And the stench of dead and decomposing cat have now filled the air.

We all get away from that area, and regroup outside under fresh air while that mess is being cleaned out. The maintenance manager's boss, and the general manager (GM) of the whole plant is the first to break the awkward silence. ""How did a cat get inside that machine?"" he asks incredulously.

So to answer that, the maintenance manager, production manager, and the two of us all troop down to the GM's office where we get to see last night's CCTV footage of the cat first jumping onto the tank's lid, and then slipping and falling inside. Kitty tried and failed escaping many times. It was really disturbing to watch. The only solace was that the camera wasn't terribly high-res and there was no sound.

So the GM calls the OEM, and puts it on speaker.

""A cat?"" says the guy who had picked up the call. ""As in 'meow-meow' cat?""

GM, rubbing his forehead, ""Yes""

""Well, Okay ... um ... we'll send someone over on Monday.""

Of course, then comes the question; how was that tank left partly open like that? Well, reviewing the footage further shows the maintenance manager doing that opening and then closing it carelessly.

Boy how the tables have turned! Maintenance Manager is the one now sweating buckets while the GM looks ready to blow his top.

Unfortunately I did not get to witness the maintenance manager being reamed out because the GM had basically collected himself well enough to ask us to please come by on Monday as well. Both of us were like ""Sure, whatever support you need!"" and we go

I don't really know what happened to that maintenance manager, but we never really saw him in that company again. What we do know is that the company had to buy an additional two barrels from us in order to flush out that machine. They eventually switched to using our products exclusively.

222,That Ethernet cable stores data?,"So background, I serve in the US submarine force as an IT and we have 1 classified network and One unclassified network.  And to keep the networks straight, we used red for classified and blue for unclassified and 95% of our computers are Panasonic Tough Book. One day I was notified that a unclassified computer was not working and no one could log in.  This happens to be in the WardRoom/ Officer's Study (Place where officers eat and hang out) well as I entered and did some simple checks I pulled the cable off the classified laptop and out of the jack and plugged it in for the unclassified laptop. An officer ( grant you these are college graduate and nuclear trained leaders) yelled at me that I could not use the red cable on the unclassified network. I looked at him puzzled.  ""What do you mean?"" He returned with ""There is still classified data in that cable and you are going to have a classified data spill on the unclassified network. I faced palmed and said I am the expert in this field and I am not doing anything wrong.  He left and told my department head (DH).  When DH came in the room and asked what I was doing I pointed that I was seeing if the cable was bad (cable tester was being used by one of my techs) and just borrowed the classified cable and plugged it into the unclassified network. My DH looked at the other officer and told them let me be because I am the systems matter expert. My DH had a double masters in computer engineering and and mathematics and helped me shut down stupid officers and a regular basis.

223,I have no internet connection.,"Ok a little bit of background. I work for BPO IT service desk voice account and the employees of our client have these physical VPN routers. These routers connect between the computer to their internet modem. like modem is lan connected to the VPN router and again VPN router Lan connected to the company company. The VPN router will not give internet connection will just get connection from modem then converts it to the company VPN so that the computer is automatically in VPN without with login but if there is an issue with the VPN router itself then you will not be getting any connection at all.

Now on with the call. I am no expert with connectivity issues I just follow our documents here to troubleshoot issue. The calls comes and verified the caller's account to the company. 

Then she says that she getting no internet connection to her work computer. So probe a little here. What confuses me here is her logic that she know the internet is not working on the computer while the computer is turned off. I asked if it was on earlier then you turned it off for now to troubleshoot with the VPN router, she said no it was not turned on today. So I asked again on how she knew their is no connection to the work, she just repeats in irritated way that she just knows that it's not working. So I asked to just turn on the computer to check the connection. 

For a moment she didn't want to since we didn't do anything yet but I said to just try for now. After a few sec of boot up time. The computer is online and no issue with the connection after we established that there is no issue on the connection she just continued with her 2nd issue without any comment on her 1st issue like it didn't happen.

To this day I still don't know how she just knew the that there is no connection. What upsets me a little here isn't even sorry or thank me for helping her on any of her issues.",9,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF29B7F0>

Well sadly the caretaker of this building sadly had a medical emergency and passed away on that Monday, so I just calmly explain that he sadly passed away and let's put it like this she was not ready to do a 180 on those emotions she just went I just saw him yesterday and then it clicked you could hear it in the voice where she just goes from ""I just saw him yesterday walk past... I don't think this problem is such a big deal considering... you can get to this whenever there is someone"" Then she just apologizes profusely for raising her voice.

225,"Keep on top of your backups, people","Another post reminded me of this story from half a lifetime ago but it was too long for a comment.  


My memory on the specifics isn't great but the gist is all you need. Hopefully its mildly entertaining...  


Many years ago I worked in a small managed services company catering to SME in a small city. Windows SBS server and basic networks. The owner hadn't been forward thinking enough to ensure that his extremely talented senior staff was paid appropriately and they left and for a brief time, I (a junior and part time junior at that) in complete control of everything. I kept things afloat until a new senior admin was hired and another (but full time) junior.   


Something that I was grateful to handover to the new senior was the old tape backup system and its nightly backups with appropriate weekly rotation, offsite weekly backup and extremely finicky software.   


New senior had never worked with Windows before but was sure he could figure it out. He could'nt and it was up to us juniors to figure out most of the issues, but he kept the backups isolated to himself and we always trusted that he was actually making sure they were completing properly. I think I was just willfully (and blissfully) ignorant as I hated dealing with them.  


I walked into the server room one afternoon to find this senior pulling drives from a sister company's PDC and swapping them into other positions in the server. Asking wtf he thought he was doing I found out that there'd been a drive failure, potentially two and he was trying to recover the RAID array. how he thought he was doing it like that, I'll never know. I told him we should just call our local tech wholesaler for new drives and restore from the previous nights backup as by now, the array would be totally cooked. This was about 2pm. by 3pm it was determined that we didn't have a backup worth a damn for this sister company and that senior had been dutifully ignoring the alerts the whole time. Me and the other junior started working our little server closet to try and bring something back online and at 5pm I noticed senior getting in the elevator. I asked him where he was going... ""home""... ok, cool man... bye. We were there until open the next morning.  


I ended up calling the old senior who was a friend and he talked me through what he thought would be the only way possible of getting anything going again, which was to build a temporary exchange server to at least start recieving emails again as these were time critical and to then work on everythong else. The drives went off to a data specialist in a different city for recovery and IIRC we managed to get the active directory back and some inboxes buuuut the majority of data was gone.   


Did I mention the sister company worked on government contracts with strict SLAs and a requirement to keep all communications for x years? No? The sister company worked on government contracts with strict SLAs and a requirement to keep all communications for x years. The company had to close while we tried to reserect the data but due to the loss, ended up losing its government contracts which were 99% of its business and was unable to continue operating.   


I'm pretty sure the new senior resigned a few weeks after the incident citing ""stress"". Thankfully I never ran into him again. The company I worked for ended up having to reduce services and withdrew from managed services completely a few years later.   


That reminds me, I need to check on last night's backups...",24,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF29B8B0>
226,"""New"" means new, ""Open"" means open...","This collection of stories is from a Helpdesk Manager role I had around 12 years ago. They were a small American company with some early success who ran into growing pains and needed more experienced people in pretty much every department so they could grow. Of course the old guard was so proud of their initial, fluke success, that they refused to ever change anything moving forward because of the fact that it worked one time before. This was especially true in IT.


I was hired to be the Helpdesk Manager. This would mean I had a team of technicians under me and my role was primarily managerial, reporting to the Associate Director of IT. In hindsight the problems began on day one but I was still too young to really see it. Task 1 was that I had to build my own machine. Some sort of test I guess. Given that I could support XML ingestion APIs that handled millions of titles across dozens of channels to millions of customers, I didn't have any issues imaging my laptop with their pre-built image. The biggest obstacle was their outdated Ghost server that needed hours to do a machine across their network.


However, what I was not given that first day, or any day after, was a complete list of the systems I would support. Sure, I got the basics right away. They were using TrackIt, again outdated and over capacity, but clear enough to use as a ticketing system. There was some associated asset tracking system too. Same deal, slow and overloaded, but it worked. I would come to piece together across the next 6 months that I was also responsible for Blackerrys, WindowsMobile PocketPCs, printers/copiers in the office, All-In-One printers in the field, GPS units, etc., etc, etc. Now why I was never given this list I do not know but I assume it had to do with the Associate Director I mentioned earlier. We'll call him Doofles. My guess is that during his decade as the manager he never made such a list.


Doofles was in his early 40s. He was not American-born. However, he was born in a white, Western European nation, so not a huge cultural stretch. And he moved to the US at age 18 for college, so he had been living here around 20 years. In spite of that, he struggled with basic English. And I don't mean he had an accent. I can deal with accents. I mean that he did not know basic words and often failed at basic pronunciation to the point that I wondered if he had an undiagnosed disability. It was that bad. So his communications to the customers and to his team were puzzling and often ineffective. The guy had a problem saying the word ""chicken"" FFS.


Doofles was 7 feet 3 inches tall. Doofles came to the US to play college basketball. He then went on to do a stint in the NBA before being shipped to the Euro league for a few years, then moving back to the US at which point he stumbled into an IT job with a tiny company. 12 years later, here we are. Not only can he not speak English, he has no real qualifications. No wonder they wanted me - a folder full of relevant IT certs and a good bit of experience managing high profile tech support teams. So in hindsight I guess it isn't surprising that he didn't know the basics of managing a service desk.


One of my immediate tasks when taking this job was to replace the aforementioned crap ticketing system. We ultimately settled on a much better system, with integrated asset management, more features, more scalability, and a web interface accessible by any user. We spent $100,000 on this which for a company this size was not insignificant. And after trials, comparisons, etc, we went live with the new system. It was actually pretty slick and not only met the current needs but offered easy ways to expand as the company grew. Of course the main component was a user-facing ticketing system but there was asset tracking, remote desktop, mass software deployment, etc.


One day a red-faced Doofles calls me in to his office and I could tell he was looking for something to explode over. He didn't like me because I didn't kiss his butt and made no secret of the fact that I didn't agree with how he did things, as it was usually wrong. IE, dropping everything and RUNNING to a help call, regardless of what it was, who it was for, what else was going on, etc. He thought that proper prioritization and management of incidents was bad customer service. While running away from a ticket you're working on to take the newest (and not necessarily highest priority) is just fine. Of course the users hated this. I hated it. And my biggest struggle was to change that mentality, which made Doofles red in the face. Somehow in his tiny mind if you drop everything to answer the phone or work a brand new ticket, you're doing a good job. Of course this system is missing the component where you finish the tickets you start. So back to me being called in...


He wants to know why there are ""hundreds"" of tickets no one has looked at. HUNDREDS. I look at the queue and laugh. As usual, Doofles and his limited brain have missed vital information. You see, when you create this ticketing system, you can add as many ""Status"" options as you want. We stuck with some basics. NEW for brand new, OPEN for stuff being worked, ON-HOLD for stuff we couldn't close yet but was inactive, and CLOSED for stuff that was solved and closed. Given our policy of not closing tickets until the actual issue was resolved, we had a lot of ""OPEN"" tickets. Not a bad thing. All very detailed so if any other tech went in they could see status and next steps. At that time we had 5 tickets that were NEW. 5 that we had not looked at yet. Out of 800 users. Well Doofles has decided that he just isn't going to look at the NEW tickets and that all the OPEN tickets are brand new tickets no one has looked at. He had even brought in the VP to try to embarass me.


The fact that it didn't work only made him madder.


There was another fun row with Doofles when we moved into new buildings a few months later. The company had grown enough that we needed it. And of course IT had a huge role in the move. One thing we did during the move was drop our old no-name VOIP system and upgrade to Cisco. Kind of a big deal especially since my team hadn't really done it before - the old VOIP was handled by another department pre-move. Yep. Not IT. So in order to make it work and support Telephony for 800 users we needed some training. Doofles sent me and my senior tech to a week of Cisco training to learn the system. On the second day I basically stopped paying attention to any of it - the training or Doofles - because he was mad that I wasn't staying on top of my inbox and taking my work phone calls. While sitting in a hands-on Cisco class with 8 other people.


Similar stuff came up when I tried to actually use my PTO as vacation, when I honored the company's policy of not taking on-call calls after midnight, and a few other basic things.


There was yet another incident during this building move. For whatever reason, Doofles had decided that our entire team needed to stay together at a hotel during this. Mind you my house was closer to the office than this hotel. We had 2 long days and nights to do our part of the move.After only the first day, Doofles was apparently concerned that my team and I weren't going to get it done (we were, by a lot). Yet he didn't bring this to me. He decided to grab his buddy, Mini-Doofles, from another team, and run back to look over and correct my work. Mind you - we're all at the same hotel. So my senior guy and I watch Doofles and Mini walk RIGHT PAST US in the lobby at 1 AM, not saying a word, leaving. We assume its booze, strippers, whatever. Nope. They were going to try to dig dirt and make me look bad. When this all came up the first thing I did was point out that rather than TALK TO ME ABOUT THE CONCERNS, Doofles walked right past me, gave me a dumb look, and kept going. I also pointed out that we had 50% of our allotted time left to work so it didn't seem fair to be saying we weren't going to succeed. And after all that, we did an excellent job. Even got bonuses for it. Not because of Doofles.


About a year in, there was an incident with a garbage new hire who didn't want to do his job. Thought that a kids haircut was a good reason to ignore his on-call duties. As a result of this I was given the option to take a suspension while they investigated or take a severance check. I thought for about 7 seconds before I took the check and left. Over the next few years that company fell apart like cheap meatloaf and its guts were ultimately acquired by a foreign business. It's pretty sad that in this day and age people still don't get that a successful small company won't be successful for very long if they stick to small-company ways of operating.",14,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF29B910>
227,Tales from the T(ech)wilight Zone: lovely customers and problematic IT coworkers?,"I recently started a position as a NOC engineer with a new company and it's going swimmingly. Documentation is great, coworkers are great and... wait let me check this... the customers are great? That can't be right.

This sub seems so full of horror stories of customers so that is what I expected but it hasn't been my experience. Everyone outside my team has been great to work with and has been super appreciative of my help. It's been a delight. But I digress, we're here to discuss CoworkerX (CX).

CX is one level above me and has been in the position of training me. I won't get too far into the weeds on how that's going but let's just say it's been a ""train by doing"" type situation so far. Which is fine, I'm learning a ton by being tasked with stuff that I am unfamiliar with, however the problem arises when I encounter a problem. My first step is to research. If I can't find the solution I carefully document the issue and post it in our chat. Here's how that usually goes.  


Me: Hey CX, ticket TICK49823, hostname [host.name.some.host](https://host.name.some.host), servicetag DKD93D

I'm trying to do xyz, I'm in the server and not getting the correct response from command 123, here's a screenshot of the error. The SOP doesn't have this issue listed. Can you please advise?  
\---  
CX: What's the ticket number?  
\---  
Me: uhh... TICK49823  
\---  
CX: you need to ssh into the box and run the 123 command  
\---  
Me: yeah... that's what I'm trying to do, it's not working, here's a screenshot.  
\---  
CX: give me the ticket number and I'll fix it  
\---  
Me: ok... TICK49823  


Here's a more specific one from today:

Me: Hey CX, tool StatusTool is throwing these two alerts and also the alert from earlier has been resolved. Here's an email of the resolution from earlier and the new alerts. Question about these new alerts, they are showing as two separate alerts but are showing up as the same ID. Do I need to create a ticket for each alert?  
\---  
CX: Look more closely they are separate IDs.  
\---  
Me: *stares at these two 5 digit numbers for 3 solid minutes*  
Me: Can you please show me? I'm missing something.  
\---  
CX: I'll look at it later.

20 minutes later he proceeds to send me the ID from the earlier alert I had already resolved and sent him a screenshot of the resolution and the new one (the two alerts were redundant as I had suspected). He had read none of what I had said and I wasted 30 minutes trying figure out how to create two tickets for the same ID.

A few minutes later he DMs me saying he expects more of me and such and that I need to do better.  


I'm maulding lol. I don't know how I can be more clear. This happens at least once a day. I'm doing my damn best at this new position and I feel like I can't win.",11,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF29B970>
228,The Agency: Part 2 - The Reign of $BadMike,"Hello everyone!  This is the next story in the saga of my time at **$Agency**, wherein we are plagued by the laziness and incompetence of **$BadMike**.  All of this is from the best of my memory along with some personal records, but ultimately it is how I remember things.  There certainly can be some inaccuracies.  Also, I don't give permission for anyone else to use this.

TL/DR: Yeah, I don't do that.  Enjoy the story :)

Again, for context, I am not in IT; rather, I'm a GIS (Geographic Information Systems) professional.  This particular world is quite small, so I will do what I can to properly anonymize my tale.  For reference, during the course of these stories I was employed at a research agency affiliated with a major university.  Here is my Dramatis Personae:

* **$Me**: I wonder who this could be!
* **$Agency**: Research agency where I was working at the time.
* **$BadMike**: My first nemesis.
* **$MrScott**: Very nice guy, very smart, and completely clueless as a manager.  Also my direct superior.
* **$DragonLady**: The director of $Agency.  Brilliant, great fundraiser, and similarly terrible at managing people.
* **$FTW**: New manager brought on board later.  Extremely cocky and confident... and surprisingly really awesome.  Very good at his job.  Eventually left for greener pastures.
* **$AwesomeCoworker/$AwesomeBoss**: Very awesome coworker, very chill and approachable yet extremely competent.  She eventually became my boss.
* **$AwesomeRed**: New analyst we hired, very awesome and intelligent.  She became my best friend in the office.

When last we left off, our agency had just failed to deliver on a major network analysis project that had been due on the first of the year thanks to $BadMike.  This was no fly-by-night project, either - it was the main product we had been contracted for by the state legislature, the one providing the vast majority of our funding.  As a result, this product had to get out as soon as possible.  **$DragonLady** had bought us some time, but we still needed to get this done quickly.  Thankfully, though, as far as we knew, we only had a day or so of work left to do.  No biggie, right?

*Lol*.

Anyways, our first day back after the holidays was on a Friday.  I was prepared to work a little over the weekend just in case we needed anything else.  **$BadMike** showed up to work, and after about half the day had passed, provided us with our long-awaited analysis.  From here, all we really needed to do was plug the data into the project and we'd be done.  However, as soon as I started putting the numbers into the final report, I began to see inconsistencies.  \*head slowly descends towards desk\*

I immediately took this to **$FTW** and **$AwesomeCoworker** to see what we needed to so.  Both of them told me to start QA/QC on the entirety of the analysis provided by **$BadMike**.  So I got right to it.  What do you know?  There were a bunch of problems that **$BadMike** swore he'd corrected.  Problems pretty much in every part, things that would prevent us from using it until we either corrected the analysis or performed it anew.

I then asked **$FTW** how this happened - wasn't he following up with **$BadMike** over the previous month?  We come to discover that **$BadMike** had only written down the steps he *intended* to follow in the documentation.  When **$FTW** came to review the data that he was supposed to be working on, **$BadMike** was apparently ""*reviewing old procedures in the old file architecture*"" instead of actually building the current data.  What he showed **$FTW** was ""*representative*"" of what the output should look like, but was not the output itself.  The reason we didn't get the data as soon as he got in that morning?  *He hadn't built it yet.*  Those 4 hours or so were spent by him scrambling to get the analysis completed and sent to us.  Because he was doing this far beyond the last minute, he hadn't paid close attention to his processes and hadn't followed the procedures he'd written down for himself.  Also, he'd done everything in the old file architecture since it would be ""easier"" for him.  In short, we had a fundamentally flawed analysis that wasn't completed until weeks after it was due - and that we couldn't even locate on the network to try and correct!  *How this piece of sh\*t was not walked out of the office right then with all his possessions in a shoebox will baffle me until the day I die.*

So we had a lot of work to do all of a sudden.  **$FTW** put his foot down and said that if the analysis needed to be redone, it would be redone, but **$BadMike** would be the one to redo it.  However, because I was the other analyst, I would also need to be here to help out, as would the rest of the GIS team (for the other affiliated parts that were dependent on the analysis).  We would *ALL* be staying in the office.  How stringent are the punishments for ""involuntary manslaughter"" again?

While **$BadMike** proceeded to rebuild the analysis, **$FTW** remained in our office to make sure that things were being documented.  I ran the exact same processes as **$BadMike** in parallel, and whenever something finished, I would compare our results to make sure there weren't problems.  **$AwesomeCoworker** was running geospatial offset error analyses on each part that was completed, and **$MrScott** was feverishly trying to rewrite the report itself based on the new results as they came in.  Folks, it is so hard to articulate what a clusterf\*ck this was.  We moved through the analysis slowly, piece-by-piece, for hours and hours over the course of that weekend.  Every single time that **$BadMike** was left on his own to do the next part in the process (when **$FTW** wasn't watching over his shoulder), he would invariably screw something up.  Because the processes were taking hours to complete, we wouldn't discover these problems until vast amounts of time had been wasted.  We'd then have to reconfigure and restart.  Then, invariably, the next process he would start would be messed up!  He'd never wait at the end of each process step, either - he'd immediately move on to the next one without telling anyone!  *GAAAH!*  It was like watching trainwreck after trainwreck after trainwreck; your morbid curiosity holds your attention until your interest begins to wane, yet the trainwrecks still keep coming and you can't look away!!!  *Your eyelids are clamped open like Alex DeLarge*!  Babysitting a toddler was easier than cleaning up the messes left by this man :(

As I came in Monday morning, I had already worked about 40 hours over the course of that weekend.  I was completely spent already and the week had only just begun.  I did the work that I could do on the project through that day.  And when I got to the end of my shift, where we'd discovered yet more issues, I told **$FTW** that I was through.  I think that is the first time I'd ever told anyone I'd worked for that this was it, I couldn't take it anymore and I'm going home until I need to come in tomorrow.  **$FTW** understood and said for me to go.  He was still there with **$BadMike** and **$AwesomeCoworker** until late that night.

On my way home, I stopped at a supermarket to get something to eat.  I just so happened to bump into **$MrScott** along the way.  He came up to me, in a disgustingly cheery way, and said something like, ""Hey **$Me**!  Looks like **$BadMike** really botched that analysis, huh?""

No sh\*t, Sherlock.  I didn't even look at him.  I just kept walking forward and grumbled, ""Yes, he did.  I don't want to talk about it.""

I came back to work the next day to discover that the entire analysis portion of the project had been halted.  **$DragonLady** had spoken to the management of our team and decided that she would ask for more time so that we could put together a proper solution.  **$BadMike** was pulled off the project entirely.  He wasn't fired, of course (*grrrrr!!!*), just shifted to other duties.  I wasn't to be the lead on the analysis either - **$FTW** and **$AwesomeCoworker** would take that over and rebuild everything from scratch.  It wound up taking them a couple of weeks but they managed to complete it.  When I did my checks, everything came up ok.  I think I even wound up typing some of the output data into the final report before it was sent off to the legislature.

As for me, I was shifted on to other duties as well.  Because we'd spent so much time working on this project, tons of other things had piled up and needed to be cleared out.  I wound up working 80 hour weeks for the next month and a half getting other projects done - the backlog of existing projects, new things that **$DragonLady** had taken on in the spur of the moment, and work that **$BadMike** had botched and needed to be completed in order to be sent out.

Y'all, this whole experience was soul-crushing.  It was infuriating to me that **$BadMike** could keep his job after a performance like that.  But what upset me even more was on a personal level.  I don't think it would shock anyone to know that I'm a huge fan of tabletop RPGs.  At the time, I was actually writing one of my own.  I had a small team of people lined up to help me out with some things - an editor, an artist, and a couple of folks that were going to review/playtest some of the work.  I had planned several design meetings throughout the early part of that particular year with this team, yet consistently had to cancel on all of them due to fires that needed to be put out at work.  Eventually, most of my team lost interest and stated that they didn't want to continue.  I was devastated.  I wound up abandoning that particular game, and I attribute it entirely to the intense overwork placed on me from **$Agency** in general and by **$BadMike** in particular.

I wasn't the only one that was tired of shoveling this sh\*t.  Apparently, **$FTW** had realized that the management structure here at **$Agency** was a *steaming hot pile*.  He was far too ambitious to waste his time beating his head against the wall repeatedly to get **$DragonLady** and **$MrScott** to listen to him.  Instead, he'd been looking for a new position for some time.  Shortly after the aforementioned network analysis project wrapped up, he put in his notice.  He had taken a position at a very prestigious company, basically his dream job.  Before he left, he told me that I was ""one of his people"" - one of the employees he'd want to have on his dream team if he ever could assemble one.  I was honestly quite flattered.  And I heard from **$AwesomeCoworker**, later, that he informed **$DragonLady** to do ""everything in her power to keep me.""  Thanks, **$FTW,** you rock :)

There were some other developments that came about due to all these issues.  **$DragonLady** had apparently interpreted the deficiencies to a lack of staff on our team, rather than any particular problems with **$BadMike** himself.  As such, over the course of the year, we started hiring a number of additional employees.  Honestly, this was actually very helpful.  The assistance from having more capable hands pulled a lot of the workload off of me and let me start having normalish weeks again.  I was able to get a breather and get out of my funk.  Whew! :)

Something else that had become very apparent after **$FTW**'s departure was that we really needed a GIS operations manager.  **$MrScott** was patently incapable of the same level of project management and it showed.  As such, **$DragonLady** started putting out feelers for a new ops manager.  I spoke to **$AwesomeCoworker** and recommended that she try to put in for the position.  There was a lot that happened in the intervening months, but eventually she got the job and become **$AwesomeBoss** instead.  Level up, y'all!

There continued to be shenanigans from **$BadMike**, but in an increasingly diminished capacity.  As far as I am aware, he was not made lead of any projects after this.  Every project he was involved in, I wound up doing the same analysis he did as a check step.  Yes, duplication of effort, I know.  If we came across an issue where his numbers didn't add up, the project leads just used my results instead of his.  Over the course of the summer, he had some sort of personal crisis and asked to work from home for a month.  During that month, he did precisely nothing - which was great for everyone on the team.  Since we didn't have to do double work in those weeks, we actually managed to accomplish more during that period than any other month in the year.  Lol.  As useful as a sh\*t-flavored popsicle, this one.

Yet he still retained his job, which baffled me.  Eventually, I discovered that it was solely the indulgence of **$DragonLady** and **$MrScott** against the constant and innumerable complaints towards **$BadMike's** work quality that kept him here.  Why they continued to do so - *that is one of the great mysteries of our time*.

Anyways, in the fall of that year, we managed to hire a small batch of new employees.  One of the new hires was a young lady I'll call **$AwesomeRed**.  She was basically just out of grad school - this was essentially her first professional GIS position.  She and I got along very well.  There were some office dynamics at play here, too.  As you might recall, I was basically the lowest-ranking GIS staff member.  I had the least education of anyone on the team.  As a result, according to the pretentious stratification ascribed to by academia, this meant I was the ""*least capable*"" of anyone there.  As such, I didn't really feel like I had anyone that I could speak to candidly about the job.  **$MrScott** was a manager and honestly part of the problem, **$BadMike** was a douche, **$AwesomeBoss** was now my boss, and most of the other new hires had way more experience or education than me.  **$AwesomeRed**, however, seemed to be just starting her career, and despite having more education than I had, she seemed more like a peer than any of the others.  So I wound up speaking to her about a lot of things.

One day in particular, we were shooting the sh\*t near my desk when I brought up an issue I had with **$BadMike**.  I immediately stopped myself and said something to the effect of ""never mind, that's not really something we should get into.""  Rather than let it drop, **$AwesomeRed** encouraged me to talk to her about it.  So I did - and I just vented away at her.  Bared my soul.  Told her everything I could think of that **$BadMike** had done that had pissed me off or made the job more difficult.  She actually listened to me!  I never knew how therapeutic it could be to just talk to somebody and get all the demons off your chest.  Anyways, **$AwesomeRed** agreed with me based on stuff she'd witnessed in her short time here.  She even said to me that the first time she'd spoken to **$BadMike**, he had mentioned that a perk of the job was ""how difficult it was to get fired here.""  What the actual f\*ck?  He might as well have been wearing a bright-red t-shirt saying ""*This is what Incompetence looks like!*""

**$AwesomeRed** wound up becoming, well, awesome :)  She became my most trusted friend in the office.

And unbeknownst to me (but knownst to you all), things were actually coming to a head with **$BadMike**.  **$Agency** had managed to craft a fairly large GIS team by this point.  We were increasing our capabilities and putting out tons of new products.  $AwesomeBoss was doing a good job running the ship as well.  It became increasingly apparent to the team's management that **$BadMike** was going to have to justify himself in his position or needed to be replaced/let go.  As such, after a long period of virtually no responsibility, he was starting to be held accountable once more.  Would he meet the challenge and justify his position, or would he fail like he'd done so many times before?  And/or would he somehow continue to scrimp by?

All I can say is that the resolution makes for a nice story.  One for another time :)  Until then, see you all later!

229,"Monitor not working, DisplayPort plugged not where it should be","Hi everyone, I would like to share a quick story that happened today and I laughed really hard.

&#x200B;

A bit of context: I work in a biology lab of about 200 people as an IT administrator and we are only 2 in the IT team, so we basically take care of everything.

&#x200B;

So, this morning, a scientist comes to my desk to tell me about her issue, something with a program that doesn't work, so I physically go to her computer and I fix that thing (there were multiple versions of the program installed so it was a mess, but it was quite easy to fix, just uninstall all, install the latest version).

When I fixed this, she tells me ""Hey, the person behind me has a problem with her second monitor, could you take care of it while you're here?"", and I'm almost always ok with adding extra work where I come fix something physically, so I don't have to get there another time later.

I look at the monitor, it's on, seems plugged with a DVI cable, source is set to DVI, so I don't understand what is the issue. I crouch to check behind the PC where is the DVI cable plugged, I see it is plugged to a ""DVI to DisplayPort"" adapter, and it seems alright as we usually use these with old monitors that don't have a DisplayPort. I move the computer a bit to clearly see the back of it, and I see that the adapter is plugged ... to the serial port.

Of course, I plug it in the DisplayPort port and it works. I still don't know who and how they did it, but I laughed really hard and they did as well when I told them.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: Second monitor doesn't work, because it is plugged in the serial port instead of DisplayPort.

230,Impeccable Training,"Two stories from my time as a helpdesk tech.

First one, a client (Jane Doe) in a completely different state, who thinks that the helpdesk exists solely to support her and her alone. We always dreaded her calls. They were like biting into a cookie expecting it to taste like a cookie, but instead it tastes like black licorice and damn near breaks your tooth. That was her.

Me: ""Thank you for calling the helpdesk, how may I help you?""

Jane: ""Hi it's Jane.""

Me: ""Hi Jane, how can I help?""

Jane: ""Can you hop into my computer?""

\*start sweating, whenever I have to go on her computer it usually ends in ""I don't know how to fix this,"" which she usually doesn't take kindly to\*

Me: ""Ok, no problem.""

\*connect to her computer and see a Word doc open\*

Jane: ""Do you see this?""

Me: ""I see a Word document.""

Jane: ""Yeah. How do I delete this blank page?""

\*pause\*

\*I press the backspace key on my keyboard\*

\*blank page gets deleted\*

Jane: ""How'd you do that??""

Me: ""I used the backspace key.""

Jane: ""Oh. Well then can you help me with this?""

She proceeds to have me format her entire 60 page word doc for her, essentially doing her job. I would've said no, but she was an executive and our department prioritized customer service. So I did it. Took me an hour and when we were finally finished...

Me: ""Ok, I think we're all set.""

Jane: ""Great.""

\*click\*

&#x200B;

Second story, I had a user call in with email troubles:

Me: ""Thanks for calling, how may I help?""

User's Supervisor: ""HEY! I NEED YOU TO FIX OUR EMAILS!""

Me: ""Ok, let me take a look. What's your name?""

Supervisor: It's not me it's one of my employees!""

Me: ""Ok, can you put them on the phone so I can work with them directly?""

\*puts user (John Doe) on the phone\*

John: ""Hello?""

Me: ""Hi John, can you explain what's happening with your email?""

John: ""What?""

Me: ""I was told you're having trouble with your email.""

John: ""Oh. Yeah. How do you send an email? I never did this before.""

\*mute\*

\*face immediately hits my desk, so hard my coworker laughed\*

\*unmute\*

Me: ""Ok, let's start here.""

I proceed to show them how to compose and send an email.

231,When a new IT department head steals the prestige e-mail address from long time employee and lives to regret it.,"A number of years back I was working for a company that had been around for many years, I was only relatively new myself but there were still a couple of ""old guard"" senior engineers around who had been there from the start. The kind that knows where all the obscure, undocumented insider stuff is and can fix most problems in 5 seconds that the rest of us might take hours to solve.

One of the guys in particular, who I shall refer to as Joe, a bearded and jovial gent with a very Steve Wozniak persona was always happy for us to approach him with our questions and welcomed us to leverage his VAST knowledge of how the company's sprawling IT infrastructure worked to make our lives easier and cope with the constant unrealistic expectations of upper management. He was a real, old-school engineer - someone who loved their job and was well respected by everyone around the department. So when his friend the current department head, a man of comparable knowledge and experience retired and was replaced from the outside with a young and brash one with a business degree and little technical knowledge who was also called Joe it was a big change for everyone. Fortunately for us he didn't interfere too much with the technical aspects of our day to day jobs. At least at first.

When the company first started out they weren't too concerned with formality when it came to e-mail address policy. In later years as the company had grown they tightened the bolts with an official policy of issuing staff with a more formal address of [Firstname.Lastname@department.countrycode.company.com](mailto:Firstname.Lastname@department.company.com) but those who were around from the early days retained their original [name@company.com](mailto:name@company.com) addresses as an alias. It was somewhat of a status symbol  and sign of authority in the company to have one and those that did would use that version as their sending address and proudly have it in their e-mail signatures and on their business cards. The retired head had one such address, as did joe in the form of [joe@company.com](mailto:joe@company.com) and you always knew when you saw an e-mail come into the inbox from somebody with one of these addresses that they were someone important who had been around for a while. Most of the department heads were long term employees who used them and it wasn't long before the new IT head noticed this aspect of our corporate culture and clearly envied his peers. But as a new employee he was stuck with his formal e-mail address and they weren't issuing new legacy e-mail addresses of this kind unless they were for someone way up the food chain. Even as head of IT he had no authority to claim one which is why when one day he spotted an e-mail from Joe using his legacy address he saw an opportunity to get what he was coveting.

So as the tale goes, he called Joe into his office and had an exchange that went something like this:

*IT Head: ""Hey Joe, great work on the capacity report and getting it to me so quickly we should be able to get approval from finance to expand our storage way sooner than I thought""*

*Joe: ""Not a problem, is there anything else you needed from me for it?""*

*IT Head: ""Nope, everything is there thanks. But I happened to notice when you sent it through you were using a different e-mail address a little different from the rest of the team.""*

*Joe: ""Yes, that's the one I've always used from when I started and everyone here knows to reach me at. Also some of our older systems and scripts we still use from the early days were hard coded to use it as well so I'm still actively using it to get critical alerts and I've got rules set up to forward them on to the relevant team addresses we use these days since the only alternative is to budget a major project to go through all our legacy stuff to change it and we were never able to get approval for that with everything else going on around here.""*

*IT Head: ""I've got no problem with that but I was interested in getting one of those kind of addresses for me, it would make it easier for people to, you know, know I'm the head of this department rather than just another employee here. My predecessor had one so it should be no problem for me to have one as well too, right? Can you make that happen?""*

*Joe: ""I'm sorry, I wish I could but it's HR that makes that decision and it's their policy is to only issue personal addresses at the top corporate domain level now for C level recruits and their immediate assistants.""*

*IT Head: ""You've been here for a long time, surely there isn't a way or someone you know who can make this happen?""*

*Joe: ""I'm sorry, it's a decision way above my pay grade. I'd be happy to put a request in for you to the head of HR to see if they could do it as a favor but I'm pretty certain what their answer will be.""*

*IT Head: (Annoyed) ""Ok thanks, do it and let's see what happens""*

Joe goes and logs the request but of course the head of HR knocks it back, citing policy and not wanting to set a precedent even as a favor to Joe. Joe goes back to give the IT Head the bad news:

*Joe: (Knocks) ""Hey, you know that request I put through to try and get you a top level e-mail address? Unfortunately HR have knocked it back, I did my best to try and push it through but they were firm on our current corporate policy of not issuing any new ones except for those at the very top.""*

*IT Head: (Visibly unhappy) ""I'm sorry to hear that, are you sure you did everything you could??""*

*Joe: ""Yes, it's out of either of our hands unfortunately.""*

*IT Head: ""Fine then""*

And Joe was right. There was no way the IT Head was going to be issued with a brand new personal address. However, his position did allow how to authorize the reassignment of existing e-mail addresses to staff which was normally used to forward mail and alerts still being sent internally to staff who had left the company. He soon realized this was possible and formed a plan, calling Joe back into his office for another conversation:

*IT Head: ""Hey Joe, you know how we can't get new personal e-mail addresses created, but we can still reassign an existing one into my name, right?""*

*Joe: (Frowning) ""We can do that, yes. You have the authority to have the e-mail address of anyone who has left redirected or assigned to anyone else if you so wish, did you want your predecessor's address? I mean, we can do it but it would confuse a lot of people if they saw your e-mail coming from someone who is gone.""*

*IT Head: ""What about e-mail addresses of existing staff?""*

*Joe: (Frowning harder and seeing where this was going) ""You do have the authority, but it would still confuse people and you would be getting all the legacy alerts and notifications which would make you responsible for ensuring they flow through to the right people when they arrive""*

*IT Head: ""I think I can handle forwarding a couple of lousy e-mails whenever I see them. I have a greater need for visibility here and there is no business requirement for you to have one so start the process of transferring* [*joe@company.com*](mailto:joe@company.com) *across to me immediately. Let me know once it's done so I can let everyone know.""*

So poor Joe was forced to dig his own grave and give up the e-mail address he had held since day one. He definitely wasn't happy about it but did as he was instructed. Falling back on his regular corporate address he sent an e-mail out to the immediate team and his contacts to let them know what was happening and to please use his full address moving forward to contact him. At the same time the IT Head proudly sent out a company-wide e-mail broadcast letting everyone know that his e-mail address had been updated and could now be reached at [joe@company.com](mailto:joe@company.com) as the Head of IT.

Weeks went by and it was clear he was taking every opportunity to send out e-mails using his new address, new stationary was issued along with business cards clearly showing his position and contact address. He was clearly reveling in having a coveted address and the prestige and recognition it instantly gave him, especially when dealing with other offices and people who didn't know he was only a relative newcomer. Life was good, that is until one fateful morning when he wasn't in his office browsing Facebook like he usually would be doing when everyone else arrived.

Turned out he had forgotten about his responsibility to forward through important notifications when they can through to him. He had set up a rule to handle them, sure, but not to forward them as promised but instead deleting them directly from his inbox without notice. One particular alert dealt with backup failures for a particularly important and long-term defense contract. One of our key SLAs was to ensure daily incremental and weekly full backups being performed on one of these old legacy systems that Joe had mentioned to him, both verbally and in writing. The media in an old backup unit had failed and was repeatedly notifying the issue. It was normally a simple fix, replace the faulty media in the backup unit and restart a full backup run but with no alerts being sent through nobody knew there was a problem. So when a request came through from the client to perform a restore of the previous week's data after an accidental deletion that backup team found, to their horror, that no backups had been running for the past several weeks and the data had been lost.

The client was not amused. The CEO with whom they had a close relationship was even less so. The IT Head attempted to throw Joe under the bus when word came down that the company was going to incur a MASSIVE rebate for the SLA breach, but Joe in his wisdom had ensured he had done a complete CYA when handing over his e-mail address, including e-mail exchanges with the IT Head highlighting the importance of the alerts and to ensure they went to the right people, including detailed instructions on how to set up forwarding rules and where to send them. All completely ignored. HR policy was specific when it came to important e-mail, it was the clear responsibility of the recipient to ensure they were handled accordingly and the IT Head had clearly failed in his accepted responsibilities. He didn't last probation, and was gone within the next month.

Everyone was wondering who we would be getting in the position next, HR and management were tight lipped on the topic and there was plenty of speculation within the department about what might happen next. But everyone was smiling when they walked in on the Monday to see Joe sitting in the IT Head office, in the wake of what happened management decided in their wisdom that the IT Department should have a Head who actually knew something about IT and tapped Joe to take the seat. He hung on for a few more years before retiring or moving on but during his tenure he was one of the best IT managers I have ever worked for and the position didn't change him from being the friendly, helpful and supportive teacher that he was. I was sad to see him go but while he was still with us I always smiled when I saw his e-mails coming through to us from the old, friendly address of [joe@company.com](mailto:joe@company.com) which he had reclaimed and had been returned to it's rightful owner.",386,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF29BAF0>
232,"I'm important, yes I am!","I found myself resetting a password for a user today that was going on and on about how I.T. has been slacking and causing a lot of backed up work lately. He was really belittling my profession and complaining about how we're the only ones in the company that aren't required to obtain any kind of special training (we do) to work in the plant (we don't work in the plants) and he was going to talk to upper management about them making some education requirements for us (there are) to have to follow (we do). 

He sounded super frustrated and I was convinced that any second he was going to start screaming swear words at me. So, I verified his identity quickly, and reset the password.   
I communicated it to him as Password123! as you normally would when reading off a password. 

Then after a couple seconds he asked me ""Which one is the exclamation point again? And you said I have to capslock the first letter?"" 

I must have stared at my monitor blankly for a solid 10 seconds trying to process what I just heard. I don't know which one threw me off more, the fact that he said ""capslock the first letter"" or the fact that this man doesn't know what an exclamation point looks like.",52,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF29BB50>
233,I'm working on it.,"Last week my whole team had a busy week as we were making preparations to move one of our branches to a new location. The rest of my team had left first thing in the morning to go be on site at the new location, about a 40 minute drive from our home office. I get a call that a critical piece of equipment at a location about 10 minutes from my office will not connect to the network. Two people have tried to walk them through some troubleshooting steps over the phone but it was still not connecting. I grab some supplies and I drive over to see what is going on.

The specific instructions they had received were to make sure that the black box under the desk labeled ""X"" was turned on. They said it was turned on but it kept turning itself back off.

I look under the desk and find that there are two black boxes. One is labeled ""X"" and the other is labeled ""APC"". The staff kept pushing the power button on the APC unit which would turn on the display and proudly show that it was working as expected and then after a few seconds it would turn the display back off. I flipped the switch on the other box labeled ""X"". The green light glows brightly to indicate it is now powered on and the device it connects to is now able to talk to the rest of our network.

I drive back to the home office where I am made aware of an issue with a critical server. The issue seems to indicate that the C: drive had run out of space but all diagnostics tests indicate that that was not the case. I place a couple support tickets to some vendors to request assistance in case any of them have encountered this issue before while I keep working on it.

I am interrupted by a request to help a user logon to a service. The service in question uses their windows login credentials and since they are logged in to windows already I decide to skip a few troubleshooting steps and jump right to remoting in to their computer so I can watch them enter their login credentials. It was fast but I notice that the user enters a space after their username before tabbing into the password field. I ask them if they entered a space.

They lie.

I ask them to try again and to make sure that they do not accidentally enter a space at the end of their username.

It works.

I get off the phone and see that I have a voicemail from one of the vendors that I was seeking support from. The vendor and I run some additional tests and agree that on this server Windows has decided that the C: drive is full despite showing that it has 20 GB of free space. Vcenter agrees that that partition has 20 GBs of space and that the entire disk has 5 terabytes of free space.

Believing it is a corrupted windows file we begin making multiple attempts to get Windows to perform a disk check or Windows repair in order to restore the corrupted files. We assign more space to the drive. The drive now shows 40 GBs free space but when attempting to save any test files Windows continues to report that there is no free space.

At this time my manager walks by and very solemnly asks if he can see me in his office. He knows I am working on restoring service to critical server ""Y"". I think that this must be dreadfully important for him to ask me to postpone what I am currently working on in order to meet with. I place the vendor on hold and enter manager's office.

>Manager: ""I cannot save this file to server ""Y"".

>Me: ""I know. I am working on it.""

>Manager: ""OK, thanks.""

Continued efforts to restore functionality to server Y proved fruitless. We make plans to do an emergency failover that evening to mount the existing unaffected data storage drive to a new server. This will require a significant amount of work to install all the critical applications to the new server but we are convinced that a new installation of Windows will solve the current issue. I type up my third update email to let the entire organization know that server Y will not be repaired until tomorrow. Just before I hit send my coworker offers to reboot the Guest OS for the fourth time that day. I hold off on hitting send.

As Windows begins to boot back up a message appears on the screen that Windows has detected a corrupted file and it will attempt to repair it. A couple minutes later we have a fully functional server ""Y"" with 40 GBs of working free space on the C: drive.

I delete the email I was about to send and instead inform the organization that the server is restored. We still have plans to migrate the applications to a new server but we will do it in a more controlled manner over a planned weekend instead of rushing to accomplish it in a single night.",14,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF29BBB0>
234,"Why are you remoting to my machine in the middle of a lesson? Um, we're not","Hi Guys,

So I work in IT support at a secondary school in the UK.

This happened today:

Some side information, like most places, users cannot buy and install their own software or peripherals or anything like that.

We got a ticket today that read:

&#x200B;

Hi,

I can see that someone is remotely logged into my account.

This is is so strange- please clarify what's going on?

&#x200B;

Definitely not enough information to help out anyway, so ask her to elaborate - someone is opening and closing folders and windows on her machine while she's trying to teach.

Now we do have remote desktop software on our machines, so we check that no one in the IT department was actually on a remote session on this machine at the time, no dice.

So after the lesson and after she has left the classroom, I do then remote into the machine to see if I can replicate what was happening. Not happening when I have control of the machine, but as soon as I give control back, text is being highlighted and folders are opening and closing.

I make my way to the offending PC's classroom and log in. Can't see anything that could be causing it, the desk is pretty messy though. As soon as I get logged in, news apps, and volume control, network connections start popping up like they're being clicked on.

I had my arm leant on a stack of booklets covered in post-it notes with paper registers strewn under them. There's also 2 plastic cups at the top of this nest of clutter. I move my arm and suddenly the desktop is calm, no movement at all. Strange.

I start moving the cluttered paperwork and spy something black and plastic at the bottom of the pile. I'm sure I know what this is at this point, but keep clearing to confirm my suspicions.

At the bottom of the pile is an XPPEN writing/drawing tablet, which I check, yep plugged in, and the plastic cup full of pens is constantly clicking the left click button.

We had no idea that this department even had these tablets, and had never even heard of them before this.

After ""fixing"" the remoting to the PC issue, I get back to the office to 4 tickets from this department asking how to use these said tablets.

We're going to have a lot of fun confiscating them.

TL;DR Teacher thinks someone is remoting to her machine, but has caused the issue herself with stacking crap on top of a writing tablet, that she's not allowed to have.",147,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF29BC10>
235,The Agency: Part 1 - The Chaos Begins,"Hello everyone!  I was asked to continue sharing stories with you all, so that is what I intend to do.  This series will detail my trials and tribulations from my previous employer, who I will call the **$Agency**.  All of this is from the best of my memory along with some personal records, but ultimately it is how I remember things.  There certainly can be some inaccuracies.  Also, I don't give permission for anyone else to use this.

TL/DR: Yeah, I don't do that.  Enjoy the story :)

Again, for context, I am not in IT; rather, I'm a GIS (Geographic Information Systems) professional.  This particular world is quite small, so I will do what I can to properly anonymize my tale.  For reference, during the course of these stories I was employed at a research agency affiliated with a major university.  Here is my Dramatis Personae:

* **$Me**: I wonder who this could be!
* **$Agency**: Research agency where I was working at the time.
* **$BadMike**: My first nemesis.
* **$MrScott**: Very nice guy, very smart, and completely clueless as a manager.  Also my direct superior.
* **$DragonLady**: The director of $Agency.  Brilliant, great fundraiser, and similarly terrible at managing people.
* **$FTW**: New manager brought on board later.  Extremely cocky and confident... and surprisingly really awesome.  Very good at his job.
* **$AwesomeCoworker**: Very awesome coworker, very chill and approachable yet extremely competent.

Ah, Academia, how I love thee.  Enough stalling.  On to the tale!

Many years ago, I worked for a research agency affiliated with the local university.  This particular organization worked very closely with the legislature of my state.  The job had started out as an assistanceship while I was going through college to help pay for my tuition, and once my university years wrapped up, they decided to hire me full-time.  It was very interesting.  I was doing GIS work for a discipline that really didn't have a well-defined association with geography at the time - many of the papers and publications we were using in our research were less than ten years old.  Despite this not really being the career that I wanted, it was still kind of fascinating.  It was very cool to be involved in the leading edge of GIS development within the field.  And I was learning a ton as I went along.

At the beginning, it was just **$Me**, **$BadMike**, and **$MrScott**.  And to be perfectly blunt, work in those days was... slow.  We didn't have a whole lot to do.  There were periodic contract deliverables and mapping products, but most of the time I spent my days trying to find things to work on.  Both **$BadMike** and **$MrScott** seemed perfectly content with this situation.  And I'll admit, there are worse things.  I had come from a series of very high-stress private sector jobs prior to this one, and the change of pace was refreshing.  I really couldn't just twiddle my thumbs all day - I felt like I had to keep myself busy - but it was still nice to speak with **$BadMike** and **$MrScott**, learning tons of things about GIS and cartography.  I will readily admit that I learned an immense amount from both of them.

However, these placid days would eventually come to an end.  You see, during this particular period, the GIS profession was undergoing something of a shift.  We were getting into the world of big data.  Datasets were becoming readily available that had millions upon millions of records.  Hardware and GIS software were becoming magnitudes more powerful, robust enough that they could reliably process such loads.  The whole transition was something of a paradigm shift within the discipline.  Where, in the past, we had to process datasets using a ""*representative sampling*"" of random points, we were now capable of processing the *entire* dataset instead.  Things like this had never been possible before.  It was a game changer.  **$DragonLady** wanted to take full advantage of this, putting us at the forefront of GIS research within our discipline.

But before we dive into the deepest, darkest corners of Moria, let me tell you a couple of things about the setup at **$Agency** when I first got there.  For the longest time, **$MrScott** had been the only GIS professional employed there.  After a few years, **$BadMike** was hired to assist.  Thus, for most of **$Agency**'s existence there at only been a maximum of two people working in GIS.  Both were academics.  They ran their projects and analyses as you'd expect a graduate team to run them - that is, largely ad hoc without any formal organizational structure.  Neither had ever worked in the private sector nor did they have any training in proper data management practices.  And it showed.  *Dear heavens, did it show*.  DBAs, read on, and tremble.

Our ""GIS Server"" consisted of three Windows folders on a network drive, one for data, another for project processing, and a final one for finished outputs.  Ideally, the workflow would be that you'd create the data you needed, work on it within an intermediary folder, then produce an output for distribution.  Yeah, I can count on one hand the number of times that actually happened.  Entire projects were created, start-to-finish, inside nested subfolders within one of these master divisions.  What about data consistency - where was our authoritative data repository?  **LOL**!  If you need the correct data, then put on your spelunking gear and let's go cave-diving into the data folder!  There were countless duplications of data, datasets of the same information that had multiple competing timestamps, different versions that weren't consistent with one another, information located in the wrong places, features with misspelled or incorrect labels, etc.  Often the others would save data to their desktops instead of the network; this would make the data path unavailable to anyone else trying to access it.  Honestly, with this system we really had no clue what data we actually had access to.  I was tasked once with performing a ""data census"" - I had to stop because **$MrScott** and **$BadMike** couldn't identify most of the features I'd found.  In almost all situations, if I needed a dataset for a particular project, I would have to go speak to one of them to figure out what I could use.  No quality assurance, no documentation, no follow-up on pretty much anything.  We probably had every conceivable poor data management practice in place at **$Agency** during this period.

At the time, I simply thought that this was the way that projects actually operated in the ""real world.""  And I rolled with it.  Yes, I was very young and stupid - well, stupid at least.  However, I could also see how difficult this made it to actually do the job.  And I made the conscious effort not to replicate my coworkers' bad habits and established some of my own procedures to attempt to follow.

A little less than a year after I went full-time at **$Agency**, our workload started to pick up substantially.  There were no more days spent trying to find something to do.  We wound up getting a major contract that dramatically increased the number of deliverables we had to complete as well as the level of funding we received.  Due to this (and due to **$DragonLady** being patently incapable of saying ""*No*""), the amount of work we were doing started to increase exponentially.  I did my best to stay on-top of my tasks and I largely feel like I did so.  However, neither **$MrScott** and **$BadMike** seemed capable or willing to keep up with the increased workload.  Eventually, it became apparent that the amount of work we were getting (compared to the amount of effort coming out of our department) was unsustainable.  We needed additional personnel.  Yeah, I got lumped in as part of the reason why we needed more personnel - a little bit of softly rolling me under the bus by **$MrScott**.  Anyways, **$Agency** went on a hiring spree.

Luckily for us, an affiliated state department was shedding personnel left and right.  We'll call this department **$Acronym**.  The ~~imbecile~~ political appointee that had been put in charge was determined to ""clean house"" at **$Acronym**, which meant that lots of talent was fleeing for greener pastures.  Knowing that our new GIS capabilities at **$Agency** would require an operations manager, **$DragonLady** hired the old GIS director of **$Acronym**, a very energetic person we'll call **$FTW**.

Again, I was very new to all this at the time, so I didn't have a clear perspective on what was to come.  But understand the problem here from the very beginning.  To make you aware, **$FTW** was to be a manager... but **$MrScott** was also to continue in his existing managerial position.  And there was no clear delineation of where each one's authority lay in the organization.  **$DragonLady**'s statement on the matter was literally the following: ""*You all work for me, so technically there are no managers*.""  ***WAT?.png***

As we all know, any organization prospers when there are two people in charge.  Or three.  Or... whatever.  It is honestly incredibly confusing to even remember how the hierarchy was technically supposed to function during all this.  Ugh.

Anyways, when I first met **$FTW**, I didn't have a particularly good opinion of him.  I thought he was very full of himself.  He was coming in from an outside entity and he didn't really know how we did things here (which, in retrospect, was not a bad thing at all).  Anyways, I was to find out that most of **$FTW**'s bravado was due to the successes he'd enjoyed throughout his career.  He never yelled, never belittled anyone, never resorted to any of the terrible traits of bad managers.  Instead, he consistently tried to give us opportunities to build ourselves up and held people accountable.  He was a whirlwind of energy, focus, and ideas.  And he was a very disciplined and did all he could to run his projects on a tight ship.  I honestly grew to have tremendous respect for him.  I hope that someday I can be even half the manager that he was.

So **$FTW** started at **$Agency**, took one look at our procedures, and pronounced them sh\*t.  After all, he had worked in multiple different organizations before, all of which had substantially more mature GIS departments than **$Agency**.  He knew what a proper GIS architecture should look like.  He immediately got started trying to help us modernize our structure.  To assist with that transition, he managed to hire another refugee from **$Acronym** who we will call **$AwesomeCoworker**.  She came onboard a few months after **$FTW** started.

**$FTW** and **$AwesomeCoworker** helped to craft an awesome first stab at a suitable GIS architecture for **$Agency**. There was buy-in from all people involved in the team, including **$MrScott** and **$BadMike**.  Honestly, I was extremely impressed with it and was sold from the beginning.  It looked like it would solve many of our most egregious organizational issues.  One of the biggest wins was that it established a comprehensive data warehouse for us, replete with \**gasp*\* documentation!  I couldn't wait to get started.  **$DragonLady** gave the ok for it to be implemented, and we went live with it.  Everything was wonderful after that, right?

*Lol*.  The short answer is ""no"".  The long answer is, well, I'm sure you can figure it out.

First off, **$MrScott** didn't feel that he needed to follow this new architecture.  He had his own way of doing things, and that was that.  And since he was a ""manager,"" **$FTW** had literally no authority to force him to comply.  Complaints to **$DragonLady** went unheeded - after all, **$MrScott** had worked there for years.  His behavior wasn't an outright refusal - it was more of a non-committance.  We would ask **$MrScott** to please do things within the structure, to follow the procedures and policies put in place, and he'd promise that he would do so.  And then he just... *wouldn't*.  Seriously.  The entire time I worked for **$Agency**, **$MrScott** never once actively used the new data architecture.  The few times that he was forced by circumstance to operate within it, he had to ask someone else on the team how to navigate it.

All of this wound up being mirrored in **$BadMike** as well.  After a few weeks of half-hearted attempts, he largely stopped using the structure as well.  I very rarely saw any documentation out of him, there were duplications of data all throughout his projects, and in many cases, he reverted back to the old structure that we had been trying to supersede!  When these things were brought up to management, **$BadMike** simply retreated to **$MrScott** who invariably defended his behavior with statements like,  ""Well, we've always done it like that, it couldn't hurt to continue, could it?""  *Dude,* ***f\*ck*** *you*.

As you can imagine, having about half of our department using one architecture while the other used a completely different, haphazard, chaotic one worked wonders for our productivity.

But this wasn't all, of course.  During the course of the year, we started seeing a lot of errors popping up in product deliverables and finished outputs.  At first, these things appeared relatively infrequently and it wasn't clear who was responsible.  However, after only a few months, back-tracing by both myself and **$AwesomeCoworker** were clearly showing these problems emanating from the work that **$BadMike** was doing.  This was because **$BadMike** wasn't following any of the procedures he was supposed to, and the problems were getting nested inside the whole process so that we weren't able discover the issue until our final quality checks.

The problems mostly related to **$BadMike** not paying attention to what he was doing or not documenting what he did.  For instance, the rest of the team would run comparisons on our spatial analyses to see if we could replicate our numbers.  Invariably, things wouldn't add up.  When we would backtrack through what we knew of the process, we'd find that **$BadMike** had done something incorrectly.  Things like using the wrong dataset (which we'd have to backtrace to figure out which dataset had been used, **$BadMike** would never fess up to using the wrong one until someone else discovered it).  Or putting data in the wrong folder structure or saving features to his computer (where we couldn't retrieve the data later and consequently couldn't 100% prove that he had f\*cked up the analysis).  Or not using the correct projection (this is analogous to the coordinate system - changing the projection can dramatically alter where data is positioned on the surface of the earth).  In all these cases, it would have taken **$BadMike** all of two seconds to record things, but he couldn't be bothered with that.  And when he was called out on it, the response would be something like ""Oops, sorry about that"" or ""I'll get it next time.""  Invariably, it would be wrong the next time.  Ugh.  I hope this hasn't triggered anxiety attacks in you proper IT peeps out there.

You may be wondering what my role in all this was.  Some of the few talents that I believe I possess are a good work ethic and an attention to detail.  This got noticed by both **$FTW** and **$AwesomeCoworker** pretty much as soon as either arrived.  I wound up working on pretty much every project we had, doing quality checks to figure out what problems had cropped up and then going back to fix them.  Both **$FTW** and **$AwesomeCoworker** were higher up the totem pole that me, but they advocated for me pretty heavily, and before long I was the primary QA/QC for the team.

Anyways, regarding the problems coming from **$BadMike**, we simply reported them to **$DragonLady** and indicated that the issues were the reasons why we needed to go back and redo our work.  In short order, we were spending twice as long (or more) on projects that included **$BadMike** \- checking his work, identifying his screw-ups, then redoing whatever needed to be fixed.  It was mentally exhausting.  Thankfully, despite me slugging it out in the trenches to get all the work checked and redone, **$FTW** was doing his part too, constantly noting when **$BadMike**'s f\*ckups were wasting our productivity.

Eventually, the *+1 Armor of Plausible Deniability* that **$BadMike** had equipped started to get some cracks in it.  Towards the end of the year, **$BadMike** and **$Me** were given two separate projects that had deadlines in about a month.  I finished mine in about two weeks.  **$BadMike** was still foundering after even the month was up, and the project was due soon.  What he had created was complete crap.  In desperation, **$DragonLady** called me and asked if I could finish his work.  I said yes.  I then spent the whole weekend working on it - and *got that sh\*t done*.  It was polished and looked great.  I honestly was very proud of it :)

As we all know, no good deed goes unpunished, so the reward for all my hard work was more hard work.  However, this did seem to gain me some respect in the eyes of **$DragonLady** and **$MrScott**.  According to **$AwesomeCoworker**, I had been considered the least capable employee on the team.  **$BadMike** was the *real* analyst and I was just a monkey banging sticks together.  Now, it seemed like the entrenched management recognized that I had an inkling of what I was doing.  But despite this, it didn't appear that anything was going to be done to modify **$BadMike**'s behavior.  He was still dropping the ball constantly and not following agreed-upon procedures.  And something was coming up that would require all hands on deck - we *NEEDED* him to actually do some useful work.

You see, at the end of each calendar year, we had a massive network analysis that needed to go out before the year ended to the legislature of our state.  Remember how I said that the datasets we'd been receiving were getting bigger and bigger?  Well this year's dataset was larger than any other we'd ever had in the history of **$Agency**.  There was a ton of work to do and not enough time to go back behind **$BadMike** and fix his mistakes.  **$FTW** took it upon himself to make *d\*mn* sure that **$BadMike** would get everything done correctly.  He insisted that **$BadMike** write down all of his steps in the project logs as we went along.  After about a week, **$BadMike** had not written down anything, and as far as I was aware, hadn't even started working on the project.  **$FTW** then came into our office (**$BadMike** and **$Me** shared an office).  He proceeded to sit down behind **$BadMike**; the conversation went something like this:

>**$FTW**: From what I've seen, you haven't started <specific analysis>.  Let's do it now.  Open a Word document.  
>  
>**$BadMike**: Why?  
>  
>**$FTW**: So we can record all your steps and inputs.  
>  
>**$BadMike**: Oh, I'll take care of that once we've finished.  
>  
>**$FTW**: $BadMike, in the entire time I have worked here, I have never once seen you document anything.  Open a Word document.  
>  
>**$BadMike**: But...  
>  
>**$FTW**: I will sit right here all day, every day, until you begin doing this.  Open a Word document.  Record the project and your name.  What is the first thing you are going to do here?  
>  
>**$BadMike**: Well, I open up <GIS software>, then I add <Dataset> in from this particular location.  
>  
>**$FTW**: Write that down in your document.  
>  
>**$BadMike**: But...  
>  
>**$FTW** (very assertively): *Write it down!*

It was simultaneously sad, hilarious, and soul-salving to watch this happen.

Anyways, with **$FTW** asserting himself and firmly at the helm, the project actually made progress.  **$BadMike** was sort of coerced into writing something down, and we were able to follow up with reasonable accuracy and head off any problems before they even started.  Things were looking up!  At the end of the project, just before we were ready to leave for the winter holidays, all the rest of the team had their particular pieces completed.  We were merely waiting on a final analysis output from **$BadMike**.  **$FTW** assured us that he had been following up with him and that his analysis was almost completed - whenever he provided that to us, it might take a day at most to get the rest of the project finished and sent off.  So we waited.  And waited.  Hours turned to days, days to about a week.  The rest of us were chomping at the bit to get things done - Christmas was only days away.  **$FTW** assured us that **$BadMike** was on schedule.  He would be able to get us the analysis in time.

We get to the day before we are supposed to leave for the holidays.  This was literally the last day we had to work on this project before it was due.  I went to see **$FTW** to find out where the analysis is.  He didn't know and looked antsy.  In fact, **$BadMike** wasn't even in the office.

10 minutes *after* his shift starts, **$BadMike** calls in sick.

I remember slumping down in my chair after hearing **$FTW** take that call.  We all sort of deflated.  We couldn't get the analysis done.  The project could not be completed by the deadline.  As a group, we all went to **$DragonLady**'s office (sans **$MrScott**) and told her the news.  She simply nodded, then said she'd get on the phone with the legislature to see if we could get some extra time to finish this at the beginning of the new year.  It would be alright - we only had a day or two of analysis left, right?  We all nodded that yes, that seemed to be the case.  With that, she dismissed us.

It was a horrible, and somehow fitting, way to end the year.  But did we get the project completed in time?  For that, you'll have to wait until tomorrow :)

236,"Yes, I accept the risk, just do it.","This might not be the right place to post, but I think it might be educational for junior devs and admins. 

I was an infrastructure engineer, with a bunch of different hats, one of which was FTP administrator. Business groups would submit requests to set up FTP interfaces between my company and other external companies for exchanging files securely. Usually it was because security caught business users sending sensitive files unencrypted over email. 

One morning I check my inbox and find a request to set up an interface with a company whose name looks vaguely familiar. It’s a company that verifies credit cards or details or something, really doesn’t make any difference to me but I’m trying figure out where I’ve heard the name before. Then I realised this company was being referenced in articles implying the books are not quite right. 

So, ever diligent, I alert the requester to these articles, ask them if they want to do some due diligence of they own before they plow ahead with their very expensive project. I’m told it’s none of my business, I’m just an infrastructure engineer, we are the brilliant minds in charge of partnering and so on. 

But it just doesn’t sit right with me. So I progress with the project as requested and send some quiet emails to people I know who work in risk and fraud within the company, ask them if they are aware, and how comfortable they are with it.

Turns out, no they know nothing about the project and they are not at all comfortable being in partnership with this particular company. They ask questions, hold meetings and get the same response as I did, only maybe more hostile.

We are ready to move into production, but I won’t budge. Eventually we kick it upstairs. If the CFO will sign off as accepting the risk, I’ll implement. He does, immediately. That was easy, they think.

The next week, the external company stops replying to emails. Files are going out, but nothing is coming back. Literally within a week, the news breaks that the external company we have a partnership with has been committing fraud. We have to disable the process, investigate any data we sent, look for alternative partners and then start all over again with the new credit card agencies. 

Lesson 1. If someone answers your questions aggressively, they are probably hiding something.  
Lesson 2. If someone is hiding something, get someone in the company higher than both of you to accept responsibility.

237,"""Let me upload these programming changes to the robotic arms... Oh no.""","An old, short story from a previous coworker.

He was working at an automotive manufacturing plant many years ago and was reprogramming the paint robotic arms for the incoming new truck model.

He uploaded the changes and started the automated painting system with a test truck frame to see how the the paint job is done. He had his hand over the emergency stop button in case anything went wrong.

All he remembered from the immediately ensuing chaos was that one of the robotic arms struck a steel beam and broke off its nozzle, so now a solid jet of paint was spraying everywhere. Another arm spazzed out and repeatedly smashed the frame like a hammer, caving in the truck's roof.

He said he was so shocked that he didn't press the emergency stop until he heard yelling. It took a long time for the paint fumes to be vented out so they could go in, clean up the paint mess and repair the damages.

Oh, and it was the day when the plant management was giving corporate executives a tour of the place. I asked what did their facial expressions look like when they saw the ruined paint station, and he said it ""pure horror"".

He wouldn't tell me what nicknames he got from his coworkers at that place.",185,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF29BD30>

239,You can get a virus without internet access. Kind of...,"A comment on another post made me remember this from the before times, back around the turn of the millennium...

Standard caveats apply: LTL/FTP/Mobile/IIRC/20+ years ago, so I might not remember everything exactly...

>><Taps side of head>

>>Ya can't get a virus off the interwebs if ya can't get the interwebs.

Okay. On to the story:

I worked for a Mom and Pop ISP in a very rural area. Very very rural. This dial-up only ISP serviced a fairly large area and there was very little competition. I was one of the ""senior techs"" because I could actually install a modem, the drivers, a browser, and the network stack for Windows 95. 

This particular day was starting out pretty slowly. I had cleared up my backlog of PC's in for repair work, hadn't had any trouble calls come in, not even any password resets yet. I had even finished the book that I was hoping would have lasted all week...

Finally the phone rings and I launch into my TechVoice:

Me: Thank you for calling the Internet Help Desk, this is 2bitCity speaking, how can I help you?

(Have you ever gotten a picture of a customer in your head from the first thing out of their mouth? Picture Ma from Golden Girls)

Little old Lady(LoL): I think I have a virus, but I don't have your internet. Can you help me?

Me: Well ma'am, usually we only assist customers, but I have a few minutes. Let's see what we can find.

20 minutes later I determine exactly what her problem is. She has a virus. It was an annoying little one, I can't remember the details, but I think it was trying to spawn web pages and kept bogging down her PC. Problem was, not only didn't she have our internet... She didn't have any internet access at all. That not only meant I couldn't help her download the right tools to fix it, I couldn't even figure out how she'd gotten the virus in the first place! After a bit we decide she must have gotten the virus through her son who would bring early memes and jokes to her house on SneakerNet, 3.5"" floppies. 

Now, I want you to remember, this lady was well spoken, good at following directions, and most of all, smart. She had retired from being a lead ward nurse at the local hospital a few years before.

Remember that later...

Me: Well, I don't think we can fix this over the phone. It's there any way you can bring the computer into my office?

LoL: I'm almost afraid to ask, but how much will this cost?

Me: Usually, about $30/hr, but we're having a bored out of our mind special. If you bring it in today, no charge.

LoL: Oh, I'll need help carrying it down the stairs, but I think I can bring it over this afternoon.

Me: That will be perfect ma'am. Oh, and please remember to bring the floppies so I can scan them. We don't want you to get reinfected.

I proceed to go back to rereading my book. ""I, Jedi"" by Michael Stackpole and wait for the phone to ring or someone to walk in. Time passes and I hear the front door open, I walk out and a 5' nothing (1.52m) woman is coming in the door.

Me: ma'am? Do you need any assistance?

LoL: Are you the young man I spoke with on the phone?

Me: LoL? Yeah, were you able to bring the PC?

LoL: It's out in my car, it's a little heavier than I thought.

Me: Not a problem at all. Let me go out and get that for you.

I walk out into the parking lot and up to the only other car. Sitting in the back seat I see a fairly large beige box tower, seatbelted in like a toddler's booster seat so it won't go anywhere.

And then my eyes drift to the floor where I spy the floppies.

There's at least 20 of them. 

In Ziploc bags.

Let me rephrase that.

Each in it's own Ziploc bag.

So the virus won't spread.

Once I stopped laughing I calmly carried the tower and floppies up to the office and got her signed in. Took me the rest of the afternoon to get it online, remove the virus, update the OS, grab a few freeware mahjongg games, and scan all those floppies. We made sure that virus didn't spread.",95,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF29BDF0>
240,I can't see what's on the back of the PDF,"I read the rules and I hope this is OK. My job title has zero to do with tech support, but in practice I end up doing a lot of low level tech support. I don't see anything that requires me to be officially IT, but please let me know if I am mistaken.

So, I work in an admin role for a government agency (thus, some details will be vague). I am not part of our overworked, understaffed IT department. However, my job is centered around scheduling virtual meetings. I'm pretty experienced with computers for a layperson, so I end up doing a lot of simple tech support stuff as part of my job, and whenever people in my area of responsibility need something and IT is busy. It's a lot of the stuff that is really training more than true IT duties: how do I install a printer, how do I switch my audio output, how do I print one sided, how do I share a file on the network, etc.

A trait of the industry I work in is an all-or-nothing degree of computer savvy. Some people enter the agency in a non-admin role. No computer skills are required for the job, and very limited computer use is needed. However, as they move up in their career, there's a level at which it's possible to switch from virtually no computer use, to virtually all computer use. This transition is a struggle for some, but most muddle through enough to be able to do their jobs. They're usually the ones who need help when I ask them to do computery stuff.

One such coworker, Bob, recently went 100% telework. It hasn't been as rough as it sounds, because his telework exempts him from my meetings, so I don't hear from him very much. However, I sent out a mass email with a PDF attached recently, and Bob received it. The PDF was a form. Instructions on the form were, ""If you want XYZ, please fill out the back of this form."" The following conversation happened over email. 

Bob: I wasn't provided a printer for telework, so I can't print the form.

Me: That's OK, you won't need to give the form out while you're teleworking.

Bob: Yes, but I want to know what the back says in case I get questions about it.

Me: OK, sounds good. (I mistakenly thought the conversation was over)

Bob: So how do I print it it? Are you mailing me one? 

Me: Why do you want to print it?

Bob: So I can see what's on the back!

Me: It's on page 2 of the PDF.

Bob: I already read page 2. I want to know what's on the back of page 1!

Me: If you printed it, page 2 would be on the back of page 1.

Bob: So page 2 is what's on the back?

Me: Yup.

I asked how did she managed to do that.

""I unplugged it from docking station.""

These were the older types of Dell Docking stations with the button needed to be pressed in order to remove the laptop.

""Did you press the button tho?""

I explained that Word doesn't affect the speed of the internet in your home. She was incapable of simply accepting what I was saying and continued:

""But I also just installed my old computer from two computers ago onto THIS computer, and now it's slow. Can you make it the new computer again?""

""What do you mean you installed your old computer onto this one?""

244,The Outlook calendars keep deleting themselves!,"I work for a specialized IT team for a single department in a rather large organization. Because of that I wear a lot of different hats and work on mundane things like printers to far more complex things like \[expensive equipment unique to this facility\]. That said, some days I have almost zero interaction with the end user, other days I have far too much interaction with the user.

On this particular day I get a ticket for the assistant of the department's vice chair. The vice chair is a VIP and thus their assistant needs coddled. The assistant is a very nice woman, let's call her Joan, but Joan is one of the most inept users I've ever dealt with. She has perhaps the most backwards workflow I've ever seen and is prone to self-sabotage because of it. This time however it was just straight up ineptitude.

""OP, you need to come help! My Outlook calendars keep disappearing! I don't know what's happening!""

Joan manages the VIP's calendar, some other high profile users calendars, as well as a couple calendars for conference rooms. Nothing too crazy and some of these she shares editor rights to with another user who is very good at her job. I speak with this other user first before reaching out to Joan to verify that the calendars are at least working for her. Yup, they're all good. Looks like it's something on Joan's end.

I ring up Joan up and remote into her PC. The next thing you need to know about Joan is her ability to chat is like a waterfall's capacity to gush out water nonstop. She is ceaseless and more than happy to talk your ear off. I've had tickets in the past when I first met her that only took a minute to resolve but end up taking over 40+ minutes because I couldn't regain control of the conversation and politely disengage. As I remote in cue Joan's verbal barrage; she's not paying attention to what I'm doing on her screen. I pull up her Outlook calendar, see the calendars, and politely interrupt her.

""Joan, here's your calendars. Are you sure they were missing? Did you not have the group expanded out or something?""

""OP! It's only because you're hear, they were MISSING just five minutes ago!""

""Huh... Well, that's weird. Everything seems fine now and the other assistant doesn't appear to be having any issues.""

""Well, this has been happening to me constantly these last few weeks and they just randomly reappear!""

Well, that certainly doesn't make sense. This sort of stuff doesn't delete itself. I think maybe I'll throw her bone, ""Well, maybe it's an issue on the Exchange side of things? I'll look into it but you should be good to go.""

I quickly excuse myself before the waterfall resumes. An hour later I get another call from Joan. Oh boy.

""OP! They're gone again!""

I remote back in but this time I figure I'll go with a more passive approach. I still don't quite understand what's going on but I have a feeling it's not an ""IT problem"" to put it politely.

""Joan, can you show me how you access your calendars?""

Joan then boots up her Outlook and from the mail section scrolls up and down on the left of the navigation pane showing me all the different mail boxes she has access to.

""Do you see? My calendars aren't anywhere!""

""Joan, in the bottom lower left would you please click the little calendar icon.""

There's a moment of silence. I have no idea what she's thinking right now but I know what I'm thinking... This person has been doing this type of job for well over a decade now. She's been at this organization for going on two years. Was this just a prolonged brain fart?

It was at that point I break the awkward silence with a quick ""oh hey looks like I'm getting a call on the other line! You good? Okthxbye!"" and moved on with my day.

TL;DR office assistant of 10+ years has no idea where calendars are stored in Outlook and thinks they were deleted",18,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF29BFD0>
245,Home Tech Call #3...,"I was a network admin in the army (this is before ""wild west"" was over) and did side jobs after hours. Usually, it was get a call at the office and go after work to clean up someone's home computer because the kids got into it and visited sites they were not supposed to visit. This is one of those story's of the kids fucking up the folk's computer. 

Situation: Folks (both sergeant majors), the kid (one each entitled high schooler going into college). House visits were a $100 a visit. It didn't matter if it took 3 hours or 10 minutes, it was $100 cash. The previous two visits were to clean out malware and other BS the kid downloaded. This visit was more of a pain than the last two. Little miss entitled had a ""computer expert"" friend come over to clean out the havoc she created since my last visit and failed miserably. The ""expert"" thought his free version of norton anti-virus was much better than the DOD-grade version of Symantec anti-virus that I had installed (this was back in the day when the military allowed their license to be used on home computers). I had just cleaned out the previous anti-virus, installed the DOD version back in, configured it to ""bonehead mode"" and cleaned up the system of other gremlins left behind from the ""expert"". We were getting ready to settle up.. When I decided who should foot the bill for this trip..

Folks- so.. The usual $100?

me- Naaaaa... I've decided that you're not responsible for this visit and I'm going to give the bill to the person responsible.

Folks- Oh?

me- yes.. I can't see charging you for 3 visits. You did not cause this issue. So, I'm giving the bill to your daughter.

Folks- Really? (relieved looks)

Entitled daughter- WHAT?? My computer friend fixed it! Why should I have to pay for this??!

me- You need to be held accountable for your actions. Your friend is not an expert. It took me longer this trip to fix what he screwed up. You caused this and in good faith, I cannot charge your parents. So.. Pony up $100 cash, please.

Entitled daughter- I just don't have that kind of money on me (she does have a part-time job, so I know she's good for it). 

me- ok.. You'd best hurry to the bank before they close. I don't take checks and this is C.O.D. (cash on delivery).

Entitled daughter leaves in a huff and heads to the bank.

Folks- Thank you! 

me- for what?

Folks- Making her pay for her mistakes and holding her accountable.

Me- I love visiting, but I just don't feel right charging every time I show up because of someone else's indiscretions. 

Folks- No.. It's a good life lesson for her. We hope she learned something today. Thank you.

me- Anytime.

We talked while waiting. Little miss entitled showed up with the cash, grudgingly handed it over and I left.",27,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF29C070>
246,"""It says BOAT, so that's where it goes.""","I help maintain the back office settings of a program we use to give out loans, including boat loans.  I received ticket asking to add power of attorney to the boat loan.  No big deal, I can just go through and attach it to the loan product after making anything that can be fillable automatically pull from the system when it can. Takes a couple days just to make sure I get it programmed right. 

I take about a day, go through it and right before I go to add it to the product I notice that nowhere does it actually say boat on the POA itself, so essentially the work I did could be added to other loans as well and not have to worry about it later.  But the ticket only said add it to the boat loan.  Knowing the process, it's much easier to add it now to the other loans than it is to add it later.  Once it's been compiled by the program you can't just then go and add it to other things.  It's silly, I would need to use their version control. Which is a pain in the rear.

So just to make sure I send an email to the person who opened the ticket.

Me: ""Hey, I know you opened the ticket for the boat loan, but since this is a generic POA, I was wondering if you might in the future want it for the other loans.  I could add it now to the other loans with no problem.""

Them: ""I said put it to the boat loan. It's not that difficult to follow the ticket.  It says BOAT!!! So that's where it goes, it can't be that difficult.  I don't understand why everything becomes 20 questions when we open these tickets.""

So I put it on the boat and close the ticket.  

Guess what, 2 days later a ticket comes in, ""Please add this power of attorney to other loans.""",47,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF29C0D0>
247,Why did they do any of that,"First time poster on this sub, a friend of mine recently passed away, and I remembered this story, the first time I ever actually gave him some tech support. I'm not actually in Tech Support, just the guy in the family who knows the most about computers and can google most issues.

So the people in this story will be M- Me, F - Friend, FW - Friends Wife also my friend, CR - Their old computer repair guy

This happened a few years ago so I am recounting details as best I can

So I was working at the retail store, talking with my coworkers when FW came and talked to me, she knew I was decent with computers.

FW: Hey, I know you know a bit about computers, my husbands computer hasn't been able to do much and is super slow, would you be able to take a look at it?

M: Oh that should be fine, just bring it in and leave it in my locker, I'll bring it home and take a look. 

She brought it in, I took it home and looked at it but I had actually never encountered anything like it up until that point, wifi was completely disabled, couldn't figure out any way to turn it back on, thought at one point it might not even have a wifi card in it anymore, but it did. There was a few more issues but this one stood out the most. So I called her husband to ask what happened to it.

M: Hey so I just checked out the laptop, how did it get this way?

F: Hey, yea, it was having issues so I got CR to take a look at it, he said he fixed it but I think it got worse

M: Mind if I talk to him?

F: Come on over and we'll call him together while you work on it here.

I went over to his place, we got CR on the phone and I got to ask him what the hell happened

M: Hey, CR, I am here taking a look at F's laptop, I gotta say though, I'm struggling a bit, what did you do to it last time?

CR: Oh he was having issues with some viruses, and some pop ups, so I went into the registry editor and disabled a few things.

And that's when it clicked for me, I never used the Registry editor for most things, because I never really needed to, I'm not IT, just a guy who likes computers

M: So you disabled wifi and all this other stuff? 

CR: Yes, it fixed the issue.

M: Well, thanks for the info, I'll get back to fixing it now

So now I knew what to look for, I fixed the guys changes, and then proceeded to do a full virus sweep, fixed his actual issues and got him back on the laptop.

Hmm. First thought is that it sounds like a runaway recursion in a script, but 'restore' is a built-in OS command, not a script... and there's no way something that simple would take a week and a half to track down. No way.  
$me: ""Okay, let's take a look.""

I tracked it down in 10 minutes. These geniuses, these WunderCoders, these unsung wizards of perl and shell:

* created a wrapper script for the 'restore' command
* invoked the 'restore' command by name instead of by full path (!)
* named their wrapper script 'restore' as well (!!)
* placed it in a directory that comes first in root's $PATH variable (!!!)
* and then couldn't track it down for a week and a half!

249,User's always lie.,"Hi all, so today I've got a tale for you that's fairly fresh and reinforces a standard saying ""Users always lie"". I work at a tier 1 help desk, typical password resets, unlocking accounts and passing on tickets of weird issues on applications that only like 3 people use in a 20000+ people company.  
Fair warning this isn't some explosive tale of people getting fired or equipment that costs millions being damaged due to negligence it's just a small highlight of day to day. 

User calls in the following ensues. For context the user is in another country and has an accent, difficult to understand;  

> varvaSasen: ""Welcome to global tech support, this is varvaSasen speaking, may I take your name please?""  

*five minutes of futzing with the user to get their name down properly*  

> varvaSasen: ""How can I help you today user?""  

> User: ""I am calling in to ask for my temporary code""  
 
*Pikachu face* this particular region is notorious at our desk for having huge volumes of new starters who are near never properly informed on what to ask for and consequently are a nightmare to get set up as they frequently bundle the terms password, code, usernames and emails. I know I'm not in for a fun time. However I do see they've got password resets in his history so maybe it's just his code. Context: We have an old two factor authentication code generator and a new one that we switched to recently. Both work but users are to be pushed to the new one whenever possible.  

> varvaSasen: ""Do you have your password already at this point?""  

> User: ""Yes""  

> varvaSasen: ""Ah I see so are you set up on your [new authentication method]?""  

> User: ""Yes""  
  
>varvaSasen: ""So the app you're using looks like [visual description of new authentication method's app]?""  

> User: ""Yes""  

> varvaSasen: ""Oh that's good so you don't actually need a temporary code since you have [new authentication method] that means you can just put that in to enter the network"" *explains how to get in using that method assuming user is just confused/has been told they need a temp code for first time login into any new device*  

> User: ""It's saying incorrect username and password""  
 
At this point I figure either their passwords expired or they've forgotten it so I take him through a password reset.  

> User: ""It's still saying incorrect username and password""  


From here I go so far as to actually remote into their machine to enter their credentials for them. And much to my surprise they're right, the details being entered are entirely correct and it's spitting back invalid username and password. This is the point where I go on hold to think of stuff and finally settle on trying a temp code from the old system. Bing, bang, presto they get through the password reset stage and gets into their account.


Towards the end of the call I check the admin side of the new authentication method and they're not set up on it at all. If users aren't set up, it'll just spit back incorrect username and password even if it's entirely correct, not even taking you to the code entry stage. So I put a guide to them directly and tell them to follow it as this calls already gone on for ages and is hitting my call numbers pretty bad and the standing advice is to give the users the guide more often than to actually guide them through it. I feel like a numpty for not fact checking the user on the admin side but equally I asked them in detail if they'd been set up or not and it turns out they were just telling me what i wanted to hear. A good half hour wasted because a user just wouldn't tell me he didn't do the proper set up steps they should of gone through after getting in the first time.",92,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF29C1F0>
250,Restore File and,"Hello there! I thought you guys might enjoy this. I recently had this call into our college help desk and I...I can't believe this happened. This woman was a teacher in a town over an hour away and on an adjunct campus for reference.

&#x200B;

Edit: Since a lot of you have pointed this out I do wanna clarify this. I was not aware that you can recover files from the BSOD. This is something that I've always been told and no one has told me otherwise. Thanks to those who told me how you can recover the files and what causes a blue screen of death! 

I also want to point out that I'm a work-study- not a professional by any means. In fact the side I operate on is completely work-study and used as a learning experience for those going for the CIS degree or used by students who need a job they know can work around their schedule. We mostly just deal with tickets, setting up people's devices on wifi, and guiding people on how to activate their accounts so they can use their school-related tools. This is one of the rare calls we get where something we're not too knowledgable on just yet comes at us. During this call I DID go to my boss and simply followed his instructions on how to deal with the problem. 

Some of you have also said that there might be a lack of training. You...are kind of correct here. Our training (which is often done by other work-study who have simply been there longer) only consists of how we help users set up their devices to the wifi, how to use our tech check out system, how to basic trouble shoot, and how to tell people how to reset passwords. The rest we learn on our own. 

I'm not making excuses on my lack of knowledge but some of you are being kind of rude in the comments so I figured I should at least put this in here so you understand my situation a bit more.

\*phone rings\* IT Help Desk this is me how can I help you?

Yes, my laptop has blue screened on me and I need help fixing it.

I'm sorry to hear that! Is this a university laptop or one bought from your department?

A university laptop, can you send me the restore file?

I'm sorry ma'am, did you say restore file?

Yes, you know the file where it's kept with you guys in case I need to restore it from that file.

I'm sorry ma'am but I don't believe we have anything like this.

Yes you do! I talk to \*my boss\* and I know you guys do.

Ma'am I can assure you we don't. If you want I can go to my boss and confirm this.

Don't bother! I'll call him myself so help me another way.

I can do that. The good news is that since it's a university laptop you should be under warranty.

That's good to hear. What do I need to do?

I'll need you to send your laptop to us and we can send you a temporary one until it's fixed.

That won't do! I have files on this laptop that I need.

I'm sorry ma'am, but if the computer has blue screened of death I'm afraid they are already lost.

Fine then, can you send me the disk so I can put Windows back on it.

I'm sorry?

The disk! The disk you use to get Windows on the computer!

Ma'am I apologize but we don't have an operating system disk to do that.

Why not?!

Ma'am operating system disks haven't been used in quite a few years.

You're not listening! I will talk to \*my boss\* about this and he'll get this sorted!

Very well, do you need his number?

No I don't! I can't believe this! I used to work at help desk and I know you guys do this!

251,"""If you won't help me I'll just talk to my manager""","Hello again fellow broken souls of r/talesfromtechsupport

This story is one that happened to me last week and honestly still annoys me, and my other coworkers who were present for this call as well.

Some backstory here before I introduce the cast, this ""adult"" called in to the helpdesk a week or so before with some computer issues after being off on workers comp for a whole year an a half. Recently, as we had seen an influx of calls of people coming back after an extended period of time we instituted a new policy. If the user calling in has been out of work for more then 3 months to just order them a new tablet. This is because of the sheer amount of work we would need to do get them back up and running was taking way too long and we couldn't risk wasting time on it. So we ordered the guy a tablet after the call where the new guy, bless his heart, spent 1 hour and 50 minutes on the phone trying to get him up and running.

Remember that number everyone, it'll be important for later on.

With that small bit of background information out of the way let's introduce the players this time around shall we?

>Me: The hero of this anime, and palmer of faces.  
>  
>User: This guy would should probably have an actual adult with him at all times to make sure he doesn't hurt himself.  
>  
>T: The other tier 2 on my team and generally chill guy.

Now on to the story!

This story begins on a Friday, and it started out as a really great day all things considered. Myself and T were watching the queue to make sure no calls were waiting while the tier I's were on other calls. A call comes in and it's my turn to take it, if only I knew how bad it was going to be.

I answer the phone with my usual greeting;

>Me: Thank you for calling the help desk, my name is EonThief. Can I have your employee ID?

He gives me the employee ID and I instantly recognize the name.

>Me: Alright I was able to pull up your account, how can I help you?  
>  
>User: Yeah I was off for a year and a half and need my tablet setup, my manager told me to call in once I had my IP address so you all can remote in and setup the tablet.  
>  
>Me: Okay, normally we don't do all the setup work ourselves. We send a 15 to 16 page packet with each tablet sent out that walks the users through setting the tablet u--  
>  
>User: Well I'm just doing what I was told, but I know the packet your talking about.  
>  
>Me: Okay wonderful, what step are you stuck on.  
>  
>User: I'm signed in and have my IP address so you can remote in.  
>  
>Me: I understand that sir, however I need to know what step your on so I can help you.  
>  
>User: Listen, I was off for a year and a half and don't know this new system. So because of that I was on the phone with someone for over 3 hours and then he sent this tablet to me. Now my manager told me to get my IP address and call the helpdesk so that's what I'm doing.  
>  
>Me: Again I understand that sir, but to best help you I need to know what step your on.  
>  
>User: Are you saying you won't help me? Cause if so I'll just reach out to my manager and we'll go from there.

At this point it's more of the same, I assure him that I am trying to help him and that I never said I wouldn't help him, and that I only needed to know what step he's on in the setup instructions. Then he hits me with this.

>User: I don't know what step I'm on, these instructions are so small and blurry I can't read them.

Remember that bit of info dear reader, we'll come back to it later.

>Me: Alright sir, you said you have your IP address. How did you get to that point?  
>  
>User: I signed into the account?  
>  
>Me: What account?  
>  
>User: Are you going to help me or not?  
>  
>Me: I never said I wasn't going to help sir, I just need to make sure I have all the proper information so that I can best assist you.  
>  
>User: I signed into my account.  
>  
>Me: So you signed in with your username and password?  
>  
>User: Username? Do you mean my employee ID?  
>  
>Me: Yes sir that is what I'm referring to.  
>  
>User: No I didn't sign in with that, I signed in with this password \**proceeds to rattle off the local user account password that we use for setup*\*  
>  
>Me: \**confused*\* How did you get that password?

I of course asked this because the password isn't very easy for a lot of users to remember. So he of course tells me.

>User: I read it in the instructions.

Remember that bit of info I told you remember from before? Yeah he claims that he can't read the instructions but was able to get this username and password for the local account he's signed into. That by itself wouldn't be so bad... if that information wasn't **seven whole pages deep into the instructions**!! I of course try to question this bit of info and he tells me the same BS from above and of course saying that if I won't help that he'll reach out to his manager.

Now, by this point T has started listening in and like me is actively getting frustrated in real time with me.

>Me: Sir I am trying to help you, I just want to make sure that I'm helping to the best of my ability. But I need to know what step your on in the setup instructions.

He re-iterated the above point that ""it's blurry and he can't see it even with a magnifying glass"". He then of course offers to send us a picture of the instructions so that we can see how bad they are too. Because myself and some others all take calls on speaker, T is able to chime in and provides him with a phone number to send the picture too.

>User: What's the number you gave me for?  
>  
>Me: Oh it's for you to send us a picture of the instructions so we can see how blurry and hard to read they are.

I don't think User expected us to call his bluff, cause he didn't seem very happy that we wanted a picture of the instructions. He of course re-iterated the above ""I'll just reach out to my manager since you don't want to help me."" and at this point both T and I are ready to fight this guy and send him back on medical leave. But he told me to, and these are his words mind you, to ""hold his wittle baby hand and setup the scawy computer for him"".

So I, begrudgingly setup his computer for him and send him on his merry way. We were of course still waiting on that picture, but alas it never came...

Either way I hope you all enjoyed that story, there might be a part 2 soon as the tablet we sent him turned out to be defective out of the box so we're sending him another new one. This time with instructions that have a larger font and are very crisp and easy to read.

252,Ummm... That's not a a usable ground,"Once upon a time in the not-so-distant past I installed large scale PBX phone systems in a number of southern states. We did hospitals, businesses, and a surprising number of department stores. It was one of those stores where this story takes place.

I was working for a company whose phone systems had an on-board computer system complete with 8"" floppies and a distinct dislike for unsteady power. In order to appease the PBX gods we had a strict list of requirements for the room environmentals and the power and grounding. The room needed to be clean and without excessive dust, with climate control - temperature in the 70 degree range on the  fahrenheit scale. Most of all,  it needed dedicated three phase 208vac power with a dedicated computer ground. This involved the XO lug on the supply transformer and ideally included a link to a ground rod or building steel. The number of times I - a brash young guy in my mid 20s - had to inform a crusty good-ol-boy electrician that what he thought was a ground wasn't good enough and weather the resultant storm still gives me nightmares, but it paled to one install I did in a small city in South Carolina.

I arrived at the start of the scheduled installation week bright eyed and bushy tailed, ready to go. As we descended to the intended phone room I became quickly aware of the technological revelation that we were bringing to this store. Sitting outside the phone room was the current phone console, with the operater wearing a headset and very literally switching and connecting calls like you see in old movies: plugging and unplugging cables in an upright patch panel. Keep in mind that this was the late 80s. From the room next to her - our destination - I heard a steady ""clack - clack - clack"" of machinery. Upon entry I discovered that the phone system was the old style ""stepping switch"" equipment. The noise in the room was deafening and relays and contacts continually made and released. My interest in the antiquated equipment was, however, dampened by the condition of the room.

They had mounted the plywood on the wall that we required for our 66 blocks (wiring points), and electrical power had been pulled into the room - but that was it. There was no ground bar, no power, the room was at least 90 degrees, and worst of all, the floor was covered in such a thick layer of dirt and dust that we were leaving footprints as we walked. I immediately informed our customer contact that this was not acceptable and why - and after I left a specific list of items that needed to be done before I returned, I drove back to the airport to return home.

A week later I returned to the site, and things were better - marginally. The floor had been wet mopped, so that parts of it were now at least clean enough to see the tile, buit other sections were covered with dried mud where the mop water and floor dirt combined and settled down together. The ground and electrical still hadn't been done, and the HVAC contractor was there giving a quote for putting A/C in the room. The room was still unusable and the client wasn't happy when I told him as much. We had one more quick meeting going over the problems, and hand written copies of our requirements were given to everyone involved and a few people that weren't. Since the floor in that spot was relatively clean I uncrated and moved the phone ""switch"" - the main cabinet with the phone system, in this case about 6'x6'x3' - into position and mounted some of my equipment on the wall. I then returned home for another week.

One week later I was onsite in the store's basement again, and this time was pleasantly surprised to feel a blast of cool air hit me in the face as I opened the door. The floor had been decently cleaned and looked good. My pleasure started slipping as I walked through the room, however. The electrical source still was not terminated. I saw no ground bar on the wall. The air conditioning had been lovingly and professionally installed, complete with open top drip pan, directly over the top of my $200,000 phone system. My imagination didn't have to work hard to figure out where that condensation was going to the first time that the drip pan drain clogged and the pan overflowed, and the realization wasn't good. Calming myself, I asked about the 208v power: the building engineer replied that they had tried and were unable to find that particular NEMA connector anywhere. I grabbed the nearest phone book (remember - it's the 80s!), specifically the Yellow Pages, and found an electrical supply store within walking distance. I left the store and walked down to the supplier, who quickly sold me the necessary electrical connector. I took it back and tossed it to the engineer with a jaunty ""there you go!"" Then I addressed the last item on my list.

""Where's the ground?"" I asked. The engineer pointed me to a large 1-1/2"" braided copper cable mounted in the corner. It dissappeared into holes in the floor and the ceiling. ""OK"" I said, pointing to the hole in the floor. ""Where does that go?"" I asked. ""To a six foot ground rod under the building."" the engineer replied proudly. ""Excellent!"" I replied. ""And where does that go?"" I asked, pointing to the hole the ceiling that the cable disappeared into. ""To the lightning rods on the roof!"" he replied.

He wanted me to connect his new $200,000 phone system, and every phone in the building, to the lightning rods on the roof.

We didn't do the installation that weekend, either.",164,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF29C310>
253,Not the support they had in mind,"Some years ago, so details are fuzzy, and de-identified to protect my own, personal backside.

About halfway through my [previously mentioned](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/s1ij6k/rogue_programmer/) twenty-ish year stint at a major medical research institution, my position, along with those of several other developer/sysadmin personnel, were reassigned from the department that oversees/administers the research processes to the IS department, which hadn't wanted our systems, but changed its mind once they became important.  The move had some up-sides to it, one of which was reduced contact with Catherine.

Catherine was a bully and user of people, also something of a kiss-up, and a long-term member of a department that had come to weigh seniority more heavily than ability, so it worked for her.  I didn't work for or directly with her, so she mostly ignored me, which I appreciated.

Not long after I'd realized that my reassignment meant I no longer answered to, nor needed tolerate the antics of my previous department, its VP announced *in the institutional* ***newsletter*** that a new function was being deployed (in two weeks!) to the system of which I had the primary care and feeding.  Setting such a feature up was highly non-trivial, requiring significant changes to the most complex and easily disrupted portions of the application.  It was also something only I was in a position to pull off at all, and this was the very first I had ever heard of it.

They had never bothered to tell me they were even considering it, never mind asking if it was technically feasible, how long it might take, or if my new, not-controlled-by-them-at-all reporting structure would agree to my doing it.

After pondering and poking things for a while, I decided that what they were announcing was, in fact, possible, given about two months' of dedicated attention and effort.  That would just get things to the stage where I could pass it along to the folks in my former department to test, which had a history of requiring two full months of active, vigorous browbeating to make happen at all.

Shortly after I'd reached these conclusions, Catherine called me.  The same re-org that shifted me to IS, elevated Catherine from manager to director, giving her nearly a dozen people to ... manage.  When I saw her name on the caller ID, I knew *exactly* what the call was about.

I answered the phone with a professionally polite ""Hey, Catherine,"" anyway, which was briefly followed by the sort of small talk you'd expect between two people who had recently worked near each other for a decade.  Once she felt she had softened me up some, she got to the point of her call.  Surprisingly, this took the form of asking me if the system could be modified to add a significant new feature.  She was playing it as if this were a first discussion (to be fair, it was) of a new feature they'd like to add, rather than one that had been announced that morning as something about to roll out.

Since I'd had a chance to think it through, I was able to tell her that what they wanted was, indeed, feasible, and would take eight weeks.  I fully expected an explosion and demand that I do the work in two because it had already been announced as rolling out then, but it didn't happen.  She must have realized the implications of my changed reporting structure, because she never mentioned that detail at all.

She spent some time trying to persuade me that I really could do it in a week and a half, at one point (rather amusingly to me) asked if I couldn't do it ""for her.""  I've no idea what view of our relationship she held at that point, but it bore ***no*** resemblance whatsoever to my own.  I explained politely that if I even tried to do it that quickly, all that would happen was that I would entirely break the system, which I could do in about ten minutes if she really wanted it to happen.  She was not nearly so amused by this as I was.

Eventually, they did go through channels to ask my management to task me with the project.  It did, in fact, require about seven weeks, because it was a bear, but I pushed on it as much as I felt prudent.  It worked as intended and was deployed pretty quickly after that.

I never learned who dropped the ball about coordinating the work with me.  It may have been Catherine or she may simply have decided cleaning up the mess would make her look good.  I do know that she totally ignored me -- wouldn't even say hello back to me -- for about six months.  I strongly suspect she viewed this as some sort of punishment.  Another thing we viewed differently.",37,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF29C370>
254,Monitor Blues,"I work at a large university in the US. One of the top universities in fact. That doesn't mean that the students, staff, or faculty are any more computer literate than any other clusers (cluesless users).

This is another tale from back in the days of CRT monitors (yes, I'm that old).

So the accountant for the department I was working for at the time apparently had an issue with her 19"" CRT monitor and took it upon herself to purchase a new one. This without letting me know there was a problem so no trouble shooting performed on the old monitor.

She had a university purchasing card (VISA) so was able to purchase one over the weekend. Now these 19"" CRTs were beasts that took two people to handle properly. Not only were they fairly heavy but if a single person picked one up wrong it was easy to dump it on its screen as surprisingly, that was were most of the weight was. How she got it to her office by herself is beyond me. Her husband and/or son must have helped.

So Monday morning she asked me to help her set up the new monitor. She had already removed all the cables from the old monitor so once again, not able to troubleshoot. I asked her what was wrong with the old monitor and she told me it was flickering and ""jumpy."" Okay then, several things could cause that but she insists on the new monitor. I grab the IT cart from the supply room, we load the old monitor on it and unbox the new monitor.

I get the new monitor all setup and turn it on. Screen is flickering and ""jumpy"" on the new monitor as well. Hmmm...so it's something in the environment and not a monitor issue. Check the refresh rate to make sure it is not set to 60 hertz. Power in the US cycles at 60 hertz and if you had your refresh rate set to 60 hertz the fluorescent office lights could cause problems. Also a UPS too near a CRT could cause this issue but the UPS was on the floor, shouldn't be causing a problem.

As I sat there contemplating the issue and watching the fish swim around in the aquarium that was sitting on the wooden shelving unit between her desk and the next workstation it hit me. An aquarium. With an external filter. A filter that uses a magnet drive...Son of a...I reach over and unplug the filter. Eureka! The monitor is now working perfectly!

Apparently when I asked if she had changed anything recently ""nothing"" meant ""I moved the filter from the far end of the aquarium to the end closest to the monitor."" To be fair, the aquarium had been there for months without an issue and with the approval of the boss. It just didn't connect with her that making a change in the aquarium could cause an issue on the computer.

So someone got a monitor upgrade thanks to the accountant. Most staff were using 14"" CRTs at the time so someone was very happy with their 19"" upgrade.

Still though, I sometimes go home with a headache from beating my head on my desk.",16,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF29C3D0>
255,When users blatantly ignore me,"Sometimes this job is just a fever dream, but I was able to extract this one:  


I once had someone at a nearby company blatantly ignore me so many times that I went down there to prove I was right.

I'd been trying to direct them to plug their computer into a specific wall port (ethernet) that I knew was patched in, they insisted that port didn't exist as there was a printer there and that instead it must be ""this"" port, only ""this"" port doesn't work (insert snide remarks about not doing your job here).

I'm sure you all know what ""there's a printer in the way"" means. I had been trying to explain that the printer had been moved in the way of the port. They insisted that it had always been there.

This person sits with their back to this printer every single day. I don't even work there and I knew it had been moved, but this tossing fuckwit, this un-moving, un-breathing, un-thinking golem of a human being was adamant that it had been there since the dawn of time, and that there was no port there, and no they wouldn't be checking ""just-in-case"".

So I hop on my bike, fly there in a fit of rage, walk in, say hello, move the printer, and gesture at the lovely patched wall ports.

I'd like to be able to end this story by saying that I took the law into my own hands and went down in a blaze of glory, but I suppose the satisfaction of making them look a twat is enough.",17,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF29C430>
256,You keep sending us bad parts,"So this happened sometime in the late 90's.

I was working for a company that sold and leased new and used IT equipment of all types.

At the time SUN Microsystems equipment were hot items and was a major part of the business at the time. 

This story is about the EX500 series, X being 3,4,5, or 6 depending on how many CPU/memory or I/O slots in the system. It was an easily up gradable system until you were maxed out on slots.

Now normally most people would fill these slots with CPU/Memory or I/O boards and connect a hard drive array  for storage. But you could purchase a hard drive board for the system. It was the same footprint as the CPU/Memory and I/O boards, you just needed the plug a SCSI cable into an I/O and terminate the last hard drive.

Okay on to the story,

I got an order one morning for a hard drive board for the EX500 system. I pulled one from inventory finished my paperwork and dropped it off in shipping. a couple of days later I have the sales guy freaking out since the customer claimed the board was bad. I showed him my test results (I keep great records) and said maybe something happened to it in shipping. Anyway I pulled another from inventory, brought it to the lab and fired it up, tested it for a few hours and took it to shipping in the afternoon. They overnighted it to the customer, all is well right?

Next day I have the sales guy along with his and my boss screaming about me sending out defective product. I tried to assure them everything was properly tested but y'all know how that goes over. 

Anyway after getting  my butt chewed on for a while i pulled another from inventory, brought it in the lab and started testing. In the meantime we get deliveries and the first board I sent came back. I grabbed it, and hooked it up with the other that was testing and wouldn't you know it works perfectly. 

I informed my boss, and continued testing until late afternoon. I take the 3rd board down to shipping and again it gets overnighted to the customer.

Next day, everyone is yelling again that I'm sending defective product. At least this time my boss stood up for me since i showed him all the test results before shipping and the 1st board tested fine and was returned to inventory. 

Finally they decide they will have the customer IT guy call me and try to resolve this issue.

After chatting with him for a while going over everything I could think of I said, ""It sounds like you've tried everything that I would, maybe you have a bad SCSI cable""

He replied, ""SCSI cable?""

I said yeah, you still need to connect the board to the I/O with a SCSI cable.

257,CEO almost fired me on the spot,"So I worked at Tech Support for a big German retailer and the CEO’s laptop needed some updates on several programs (because we weren’t allowed to push that remotely on him… his rule). I go into his office and he was already annoyed about the fact it was going to take longer than 2 seconds. So he said he was going on a break, i do the thing and left. Took me 30 seconds. 

I get a call from him 5 min later: ‘you fucked up my computer, my screen is flashing and i can’t press anything! get in here NOW.’ 

*Sweat pouring down my back as i took the elevator and came back in.*

“What the fuck did you do? I can’t do shit here without you guys messing up every tiny thing. I swear I’m getting a whole new department if this shit happens again!”

258,"""We already tried to fix it ourselfes""","Hello again.

while looking through the comments of my last post i remembered a story a coworker one told me. Let's call him Tim.

Tim once worked as service technician for a rather large company wich sold printers among other things. He normally drove to customers to repair everything printer-related.

Once a customer called complaining about one of their printers (one of those big office printers, not the small ones you put on your desk. Important lateron) not feeding paper in correctly. Tim thought about some things that might cause this problem while driving something arount 300 kilometers to them.

Tim was warmly welcomed and was given some coffee before they send him out to the office the printer was located. He came into the office and asked where the printer was. They told him they tried to fix it themselfes so they moved it into another office for space-reasons.

He was handed a jar full of screws, wich was suspicious by itself, and walked to the other office.

Turns out by ""fixing it themselfes"" they meant taking the whole damn thing apart. Every screw they could find was in said jar, the smaller parts like motors, smaller plastic stuff and such were stored in another jar and bigger parts from the housing were just laying arount the office. They even took the gearbox apart.

After a minute of awkward silence they asked him if he could put it back together. He told them that putting the printer back together was most likely more expensive than just buying a new one, but they insisted. Tim called his boss to ask what to do, boss approved to putting it back together. So he took his time putting it back together, wich took around 9 hours (remember: EVERYTHING. Every single piece, every single screw...) resulting in a massive bill.

They never heard from this customer again, probably some higher-up complained about this more than stupid decision...

I really don't know what is going on in some peoples heads...Sometimes I'm glad that such people don't drink from the bucket while cleaning.

ETA: Yes, everything worked fine after the reassembly. A small sensor somewhere caused the initial problem, it wasn't even replaced, just thoroughly cleaned.

259,A slight humidity problem and impromptu casemod.,"Preface: The below is a copypaste of a comment I made on a different subreddit regarding humidity in the server rack. I was told it'd fit here too.

--------

Had something very similar happening at work once. It was on a survey ship, and we were working in south america at the time, so the AC had to work at 100% power all the time to ensure that the air stayed dry.

Yep, the air was dry, alright. However, what nobody thought about during AC install was that ships tend to roll, so the condensation buildup didn't always drain where it was supposed to. This system had to always be on for production purposes, so there wasn't really any chances of shutting everything down and dealing with the situation properly.

After roughly two years of continuous operation, the water buildup at the bottom of the rack enclosure was so large that water was sloshing back and forth all the time. The enclosure contained four racks, all with computers that somehow survived.

However, one of the most critical computers, of course located at the bottom of one of the racks, was starting to have a disturbing buildup of rust. It still worked, but everybody knew that it could fail at any moment, so we did what we always did: Make do with as little downtime as possible.

I set up a spare computer, identical in almost every way, and rsynced over the contents of the old machine. Luckily these machines don't change a lot, as the data output goes elsewhere. The plan was to swap it during a 15 minute window (called linechange) we had every now and then, and have everything up and running by the time the ship had turned around ready to do the next survey line. There was just one catch: The old machine had a serial interface card of which there were no spares, which meant that I had to take the card out of the old machine and put it into the new one.

Everything was planned down to every little detail. Linechange came, and as soon as one of the navigators called ""clear!"", I started powering down the entire production system. While most machines were allowed to do so cleanly, the machine about to be replaced wasn't as lucky: Power chord was yanked from it, and everything was unplugged. As I had already loosened the rack screws, getting it out and onto the work desk nearby was done in less than 30 seconds after the clear signal was given.

""Oh shit"" I said to myself, as I stood there with the serial interface card is my hand. Remember how I said that the new computer was ALMOST identical? Well, one of the differences was that the new one didn't have a proper riser, so I had to connect the card vertically instead, for which the chassis wasn't tall enough.

""Are we still OK to start the line?"" the navigator asked with a nervous expression. I looked at my options, and went over in my head what resources I had available on board.

""Circle once"" I declared, which basically meant that I'd have 10 minutes extra. I ran out of the instrument room and down to the mechanics shack, where they were drinking coffee, knowing they'd be down until the instrument room called and said we were back online. ""I need a hacksaw"" I called out. The chief didn't say anything, but looked a bit perplexed, as he knew the rough outline of what I was doing. He walked over to his toolbox and gave it to me. On my way out of the mech shack I heard him yell ""Let me know if you need a hammer too!"".

So back in the instrument room I started sawing the computer chassis, while the navigator called out estimates for how much time I had left. When I had the thing frankensteined together and started booting, there were 5 minutes left.

Finished booting at 3 minutes left.

I started to go over the services that had to run for the cluster to work as intended, and you know you're short on time when you hear someone starting to count down in seconds instead.

I started the last service, and we waited in excitement for this light to turn green on one of the many moniters, as the countdown is below 10 seconds.

""GO!"" i said, as the light turned green, literally three seconds before start. Everybodys heartrate instantly lowered as soon as we all heard the boom that meant the airguns fired as intended.

As far as i know, the AC issue was never fixed, but someone had to enter with a mop every now and then, with the glass panes looking like in OPs picture. The new computer worked for as long as I was there.

​
Out of curiosity I decided to look up the ship on marinetraffic.com just now. Judging by its past sailing tracks, it's still in operation. I seriously hope they fixed the issue. It's been well over 10 years since I was onboard.

260,How to type a phone number,"One from a colleague of mine who looks after support for our telephone and conference equipment:  

User calls and says they can't dial in to a phone conference call because their phone doesn't have the correct button on it.   

They explain they can dial the general conference number but they can't enter the 5 digit code to connect them to their specific conference call.  

Colleague has very occasionally had similar things before with British vs US English and people getting confused when asked to press #, which can be called a pound or hash key.  But it's not that.   

So colleague asks them for the number and for permission to connect as a test. User agrees, colleague connects without issue.   

Colleague is puzzled and asks user to go through it again step by step with them saying what button they're pressing, as they're pressing it, so colleague can ~~work out how they can possibly screw this up~~  'check the logs'.   

Everything's ok until user gets to the 5 digit code, which has a nice sequence 7 8 9 10. Easy to remember, easy to type.   

However user explains that their phone keypad only goes from 0 to 9, and they don't have a ten key....   

Colleague goes on mute for a few seconds, and once they've stopped laughing they diplomatically suggest someone may've given them an incorrect code and to try one-zero, not ten.   

User thanks him and goes away happy, still not realising what happened.",83,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF29C610>

So I used to work in a call center for an American phone service (sells phones, doesn't make them). I'd get plenty of calls about poor connection and data, even one lady who insisted I was Samsung and lying to her about working for Service Provider. One day, I get a call from a guy asking for help because he deleted his mail app. 

Now I was 100% allowed to just give him contact info for the phone manufacturer, but it was a slow day and he seemed nice (if clueless), so I decided to walk him through it. Tried turning it off and on again, didn't work.

263,When users are even outplayed by a bunch of cables,"LTLFTP

I work in inhouse IT in a medical research institute in Germany. Not much to tell, but it's one of the stories every new IT employee here gets to hear.

You would think that people here would have some basic understanding of computers and machines. But this one user, let's call him Martin,  was... a bit untalented with computers. I can understand that someone doesn't know some basic windows-stuff, certain software or else, but some basics should be there.

Martin had a problem with his monitor turning off and on randomly. As we were a little bit understaffed and had only little to no time to walk to every users office to analyse I told him to try a new cable because this solved the problem in the past. He came to us to get a new cable, I gave him one and told him to try it out.

Half an hour later Martin called me. The new cable doesn't work at all. I asked the basic IT questions (""Is the monitor turned on"" etc.), but none of them seems to be the problem. So i took the time to come to him.

He was fiddling around on the back of the monitor complaining about the cable not fitting. Remember those plastic caps on new cables to protect the connector? He tried to plug his new VGA cable in with this caps still on. Severely damaged his monitor with it, ended up with me getting him a new monitor and explaining to him how to plug in cables. He thanked me, everything was okay. Our IT department had a good laugh and things were forgotten shortly after.

Something like 4 month later Martin called again. one of his USB ports stopped working. I walked directly to his office since I was on my way to another user. Turns out he somehow didn't manage to plug his USB stick in the right way. Basic trial and error everyone has with USB ports at one point. But somehow he managed to push so hard on it that the USB port broke off internally now just wiggling around. He told me that he even marked the ""up side"" on this stick so he doesn't have to fiddle around everytime.

I don't know if you ever tried to jam a cable or usb stick in with something blocking it from going in, but it takes quite some force. Don't know how this happens ""on accident""...

Can't make this shit up...

265,Where did this person get their information from?,"This weekend I had possibly the stupidest customer I have ever encountered.

So they get through to me asking how to do something on their product that they absolutely cannot do. I tell them this feature is not available on the product they have and this is unacceptable to him. They tell me that they bought this product specifically for the thing it cannot do and they complain that they have been misled about the product. I assume that they've been lied to by an unscrupulous salesman and advise him to get in touch with the retailer.

But it turns out they were weren't lied to by a salesperson at all. They saw some nonsense on YouTube and just went with that without doing any research of their own. It wasn't even a YouTube video that misinformed him, **it was one of the comments on a video of someone reviewing the product**.

They become extremely irate with me (because this is all my fault, some how) and start demanding that I tell them where some random commenter on YouTube got their information from. How they would expect me to know something like that is completely beyond me.

They stayed on the line with me for over an hour complaining and embarrassing themselves. I can't get over how genuinely stupid this person is, it's a miracle they're even able to work a phone.  It took all the restraint I could muster not to tell them to grow a fucking brain and stop annoying me.

They left me a bad review, I'm sure that will teach random guy on YouTube his lesson.",177,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF29C7F0>
266,I Just Need A Picture!,"So, to preface; this did not happen to me so there are some details I do not know exactly as this is from a retelling from my coworker right after it happened. I am aiming to keep things brief in case he ever decides to post the story himself with greater detail. We work at a MSP, so we handle a lot of clients with varying degrees of tech literacy. We also work with some large scale clients, we'll just say this client cuts hair for a living and leave it at that.

My coworker got on the call to deal with an issue with a credit card terminal, sounded like it was getting some weird error. He spends a good deal of time trying to get them to give him details of what's going on, does some basic troubleshooting, rebooting and all that, but nothing has helped and the caller is not the most helpful. Eventually he decides he needs a picture of the error and asks them to take a screenshot. The caller does not know how to do this, and he tries to explain he means that he needs a picture of the error. It takes a good chunk of this two hour call just to get them to take a picture and email it to him.

Finally he gets to a point where he has convinced them to use their phone to take a picture of the terminal and email it to him. He sits and waits patiently, and starts to hear a weird noise, like a humming noise, and after a while they finally let him know its been sent. He goes and opens up the shared email box for our department and sees the email with the attachment, opens it up and stares at the picture trying to understand what he's looking at.

The picture in question is mostly white with the terminal barely visible in the dead center, he can just make out what is on screen, but more importantly he notices a strange black rectangle around this washed out image. It then hits him what he is looking at:

The caller had taken a picture on their phone, put their phone on a scanner, scanned an image of the phone with the photo of the terminal to the computer, and emailed that to him.

The worst part of this: It wasn't even a picture of the error. Just the main screen.",31,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF29C850>
267,Playing it safe…,"LTLFTP 

So I used to to work for a company that sells tech as well as does at home tech support and installation.

One day, I was called to an apartment that supposedly had a problem with a router that was purchased just a few days ago. I’m thinking “*oh no problem, it’s just an old person who can’t set up basic wifi/router tech*”.

Nevertheless, I made my way to this apartment and I find myself surrounded by paper supermarket grocery bags. I’m not kidding.

On every surface of the apartment was a paper grocery bag. Walls? Check. Ceiling? Check. Countertops? Check. Toilet seat??? Unfortunately, check. 

The one customer warned me not to open the closet, as that’s where the leftovers were. I’m so confused as I was also instructed that the router was in the closet.

I’m thinking like, *WTF, these people are just crazy, their waste is just absurd. What really can be wrong with their wifi.*

I nervously open the closet to get literally rained on by grocery bags. Not even kidding, I was rained on by grocery bags and the whole closet was just filled with paper and grocery bags, it was insane. 

I, now frustrated, asked where the router could be. The customer told me it was in the safe and I had to find it. OMG! I was actually beside myself. 

I finally threw enough grocery bags to the side and I found the safe and asked for the code. He pointed at the fridge (!!) which had a smeared expo marker that barely resembled numbers. 

I tried guessing and eventually threatened giving up and they gave me the code. 

“*Finally, this has taken too damn long*”

I open the safe to find the router is covered in tinfoil. Like what. Why. 

Anyways, I took it out and set it up for them. They kept complaining that “I was letting it out of its cage” but I didn’t care, just wanted to leave this place.

Wrapped it up and could barely say my concluding thoughts and additional steps before I booked it out of there. It doesn’t help that my wife is 8 months pregnant and I had to get back to her too. I have enough stress in my life and this wild encounter didn’t help.

268,Your little black box is causing the lights to flicker!,"I had a fun call 2 days ago from one of our offices, thought I'd share.

ME: is well, me.

CL is confused lady.

>ME: This is me, Can I help you.

>CL: Hey, something is bad wrong!  There's a black box that's causing the lights to flicker and it kills our internet, it beeps every time it happens so it's got to be causing the problem.

>ME: Where is this ""black box""?

>CL: In the closet with the internet stuff.

>ME: Ah, in the network closet.  What does it look like, does it have any writing on it?

>CL: Yeah, it says ""APC smart UPS"", can I unplug it, it's really causing problems, we can't work like this.

>ME: No, absolutely not, that's not the cause of your problem!  That is a battery backup for your network equipment.  It's beeping because the power is going on and off in the building and that box is keeping the network equipment protected and online.  When the power goes out, it beeps an alarm.  You said you were loosing internet as well?

>CL: Yes, I loose internet because my computer keeps turning off.

>ME:  Call someone in maintenance and have them check the power right away!

Turns out the main breaker box in the small office was smoking, I'm not an electrician but they had to kill power and replace the entire box.

TLDR:  The UPS beeps when the power goes out, Let's unplug it, stop the beeping and therefore keep the power on.  I loose internet when my computer turns off.",136,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF29C910>
269,"""We heard you were the admin? SHUT DOWN EVERYTHING""","So many of you enjoyed [my last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/s95305/we_have_never_had_wifi_in_this_building/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) that I figure I could now tell the prequel of that adventure that so many of you asked about. 

Warning: I did this on my phone. But I am to lazy (and my thumbs hurt) to fix any spelling or grammatical errors. You have been warned. 

In the last episode, I said 

> I thought I would be let go. Low and behold I wasn't. But that was for an unpleasant reason

Or something like that. 

When Covid hit and the shut down happened, the entire company scrambled to prepare to go fully remote by the end of one business day. In the midst of the chaos, we needed three major things. 

1.) A cloud based file storage and sharing system 
2.) A web video and conferencing solution
3.) A miracle since our outsourced IT company deemed 1&2 out of scope and was going to charge us our first born children and king size Snickers to get it done, at the earliest, 3 months. 


Let's back up real fast:


I had been working at the organization for 1 month at this time. I was originally hired as a SharePoint admin. However my boss at the time didn't really know how SharePoint worked, or even how it was going to benefit the company. She just had it at her last job and thought this company needed it too. Which in hindsight, she was right. 

My first week on the job was spent waiting on the IT company to grant my MS account SharePoint admin access. By Monday they still didn't have it done, I forwarded the ticket # to my boss. She calls up our account manager and rips into them. In less them a minute I have SP admin access. 

However, that's not all I had. They actually granted me global access over the entire domain and account. I brought this up to my boss. Who said ""ok but do have access to SharePoint now?"" Which I say ""yah but now I ha....."" She cuts me off and says ""good. Then start working on SharePoint."" I just back out of her office and save the fight for another day. 

Back to the main timeline:

I mention in an emergency operations meeting that we have the needed solutions already with SharePoint, OneDrive, and Teams. Granted no one understands how to use those. But they are there for use to use. 

Bad idea. 

Everyone looks at me with either pure bliss, or confusion. 

The CEO of the company goes ""let him train THE ENTIRE COMPANY"" by the end of day and we will all go home. 

So I do just that. 8 hours of training large groups over SharePoint, OneDrive, and Teams. 200+ employees and I am the only in house ""IT"" we have to pull this off. 

But it gets done and we were all in our homes. 

A months goes by and I am just doing my SharePoint thing. And I get a teams call. From the CEO? Well this is either good or bad. 

The following conversation between me, the CEO, the COO, and the President (P)

CEO: hello! We are wonder if you have a moment to help us with something?

Me: Of course! What can I assist you all with. 

A very uncomfortable pause. I don't know if they knew their camera were on (mine was as well). But I could tell they were not happy with what was about to be said. 

CEO: We are having to make some layoffs. 

Me internally: well it was fun while it lasted. 

CEO: but don't worry, you are save. We need you here. Especially after you got us all remote. 

Me internally: holup....

CEO: We just got off the phone with IT company. And we were wanted them to starting turning off accounts and shutting down emails they said they could do it, bit it would be a two week turnaround. We need it all done today. They mentioned you have admin access. Is that true? 

Me: Ya I got it a few weeks ago.

COO: shut down everything

Me: I'm sorry what do you mean by that. 

P: We need you to pause all emails, teams chat, doc sharing, everything. We also need everyone locked out of their accounts while we start making phone calls. The only people who need access is us three and you. 

Me: ok. I can do that. But what do we do when people start asking when they are locked out?

CEO: We have asked that our IT Company send out an email to everyone in an hour saying there are technical difficulties and to please be patient. 

Me: ok.... So after I shut everything ""off"" what do I do next?

COO: wait for one of us to call you. We will have a list to you on who's accounts need to be permanently turned off. 

Me: ok I can do that. 

P: also, who is your boss? 

Me: [says bosses name] 

P: ok. You will report to me now until further notice. 

So I turn off everything. Chill at home and play video games for two hours before I get another teams call from P. 

P: ok I'm sending you a list now. 

Me: got it. I'll work on the accounts then turn everything back on. 

P: good deal. Oh and one more thing. You are no longer SharePoint admin. You are now out Systems Administrator. 

Me: ok.... Of what Systems

P: All of them? 

Me: ok but how many systems is that? 

P: I don't know. Whatever software we use for any department. You are the admin of it. I suggest getting with the different departments and finding out what they use and go from there. 

Me: ok. That might take awhile. 

P: once your done. Report to me on what you find. As well as the cost of everything. 

Me: ok. Excuse me if this is to soon to ask, but will this come with any compensation? 

P: ya it's too soon

End call

""I hope this pandemic isn't to long. I have a feeling this won't be fun.""

I remember thinking to myself. 

I had no team. No one that was left in the company had any IT knowledge that would be useful to me. We ended up ending our contract with the old IT firm and went with a better one. But they were short staffed all the time. And I was pretty much left in charge of the entire IT infrastructure and management of the company as a one man show. 

When two months prior, I was just supposed to be making and managing SharePoint sites.

270,CRT Monitor Goes Blank,"I work at a large university in the US. One of the top universities in fact. That doesn't mean that the students, staff, or faculty are any more computer literate than any other clusers (cluesless users).

I had a secretary/receptionist call me at 4:25 one Friday afternoon complaining that her monitor just went blank. Ask the usual questions and yes, the computer was on, the monitor power light was on but the monitor was blank. Note that this was a 19"" CRT beast of a monitor, that's how long ago this happened.

I tell her I'm in the middle of something but will be there when I can. I get there about 15 minutes later and she is gone for the day. Sure enough though, the monitor is blank and nothing I do would revive it. Now it always irritates me when someone calls for help and when I get there they are nowhere to be found. Since quitting time is only 15 minutes away I shut everything down and think I'll deal with it on Monday.

Monday rolls around and she calls out sick. Okay, all day to test this beast. Turn everything on and the monitor is working perfectly. I decide to leave it on all day and tell the secretary working at the back desk to just shut off the power strip if it catches fire or such like. I return around 4:30 that afternoon and there have been no problems. Shut everything down and call it good.

The receptionist called me the next morning asking what I done to fix the monitor. I told her I had done nothing and that it had healed itself over the weekend. I then told her if she had any other problems to give me a call.

That Friday at 4:25 she calls, her monitor is again blank. I had learned the reason that she wasn't there the last Friday when I came to look at her monitor was that she came in 30 minutes early and left 30 minutes early because of transportation issues. I told her I would be right there and not to leave before I got there.

I get there and sure enough the monitor is again blank. It is as if it is not getting a video signal at all. I knew I had checked all the video connections the previous week but decided to check again just in case. VGA connection to the computer? Check. Connection to the monitor? Check. Wait a minute...While checking the monitor connection I notice some drops of water on the back of the monitor. Remember this is a 19"" CRT beast and has air vents all over the back of the monitor?

I reached up on the shelf above the monitor and moved the potted plant that she over watered every Friday just before going home. I don't know how long it had been there or why there was suddenly a problem but it was lucky the water had not reached the high voltage side.

Yeah, she was waterboarding her monitor on Fridays.",22,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF29C9D0>
271,Arrogant Coworker gets impatient and tries to do my job,"I posted this somewhere else first, but someone suggested I post it here and it probably fits better.

A  few years ago, I was working IT support and data analysis at a smallish  (\~50 people) company. I had gotten the job thanks to my father being  the head of IT, and had spent the last few years trying to prove myself,  and I generally liked my job, was good at it, and most people respected  me. Even though I was young and looked younger, I had worked there  longer than about half of the company because we recently expanded to  double the number of employees. I was in charge of assigning laptops  among other things, and I was the first line of support if something  techy went wrong.

One of the newer  employees was a multi-lingual sales guy I'll call Marty. Marty had a  high opinion of himself and his own capabilities, including with  technology. Instead of asking for help or resources from the IT team, he  would rather look up problems himself and try to solve them sometimes  using free software downloads from random websites. You may think that  this is good, less for me to worry about, but I liked helping people  with their tech issues and he had a knack for making things worse. He  somehow managed to get a virus on his company Macbook (some tool that  also happened to divert all his network activity to a random IP, a huge  security issue).

One day, Marty  had a laptop problem that he couldn't solve. He didn't like it, but I  told him he could either take it to an Apple store himself (it was under  warranty), or I could reset it but keep his files. He took a day to  think about it and decided to let me reset his Macbook. I had informed  him that I would have to perform a full backup and this could take  several hours depending on how many files he had.

So,  I started the backup process in the morning, and tried to go about the  rest of my job, but Marty decided to park himself on a chair between me  and my desk neighbor and watch the backup. It made me uncomfortable to  have Marty in my personal space and sharing my desk with me. I told him  he could still do a lot of his work via his phone, as other sales people  do when I work on their laptops, and in response he asked if he could  use my phone charger. I tried politely hinting at him to go find  somewhere else to sit, but he didn't get it. So I straight up told him  he was in my personal space and making me uncomfortable, and to go find  somewhere else to be and I'll inform him when the migration is done in a  few hours.

The backup took longer  than expected due to the number of files Marty had. Marty had decided  rather than sitting at his own desk, he still wanted to hover nearby and  was on his phone in the IT ""lounge"" area, and making the people who  work in that area slightly uncomfortable. The backup completed after  lunch, but I had a meeting to attend with a VP before it finished. I  rarely had meetings, and this one wasn't long, about half an hour.

When  I got back to my desk after the meeting to check the status of Marty's  laptop, I saw that it was behaving unexpectedly (netbooting). I asked my  desk neighbor ""Victor"" if he had done this, and he told me no, but  Marty had been at my desk while I was away at a meeting. My mind quickly  filled in the blanks of what must have happened while I was away from  my desk for JUST A HALF HOUR.

Impatient  Marty had come and wiped his hard drive, as according to what he had  read online. I had done the full backup because it was policy and just  in case, but I knew his problem would probably be solved if I  reinstalled the OS but kept his files, and it would take less time too.  But he had wiped EVERYTHING and also managed SOMEHOW to wipe the  recovery partition too. This man is dangerous. And I knew thanks to a  mistake I had made months before on a different laptop, that this job  had gone from almost done to taking up to 12 more hours to complete. I  was PISSED that he somehow thought that he could just walk all over my  work. I was PISSED that I would now have to work on this overnight,  because I don't want to keep him away from his laptop for more than a  day.

I angrily confirmed with  Marty what he had done, and informed him that he had really messed up  the laptop, and I definitely wasn't going to get it up and running  today. But I was still angry, so I told my dad, the head of IT, what had  happened, and he agreed that Marty had crossed a line. But I was STILL  angry, and so I told Marty's boss, the head of sales, what he had done.  Marty had also talked to her, and she convinced me to lend him a spare  laptop to use until I could finish fixing his. I confirmed with my dad  that I would give him the oldest, clunkiest spare laptop on hand, and he  agreed. That made me feel a little better, like at least Marty would be  a little inconvenienced by what he had done. Marty had MAJORLY  inconvenienced me.

I took the  amnesiac Macbook home and fixed it overnight. (Downloaded MAC OS and  installed via USB). I restored Marty's files. I gave him back the laptop  the next day. I was still pretty pissed at Marty but he insisted he  needed to talk with me privately. He took me into a room to basically  say sorry and ask me not to tell on him next time. I said ""whatever"" and  left the meeting room because I just wanted him out of my face. When he  gave me back the old loaner laptop, he told me he liked it better than  his shiny new one and asked if he could keep using it. This slightly  angered me further because it was supposed to be a punishment! He wasn't  supposed to like it! I had to tell him no because (company policy) I'm  not giving him an out-of-warranty laptop.

I'm normally an easy going, forgiving person, but Marty thinking that he was entitled to do my job for me? Unacceptable!

TL;DR It takes hours to backup this guy's laptop before a reset, I  leave my desk for a short meeting and return and he's taken it upon  himself to wipe his hard drive, causing me many hours more work. He then  asks me not to report him next time he screws something up.

&#x200B;

EDIT: I do agree with many of the commenters that ""Marty"" did not deserve any of my time at home, and now, in today's post-pandemic environment, I certainly wouldn't suggest anybody do the same. Back then, taking occasional work home in exchange for being able to leave early/arrive late/take half days whenever you want seemed like a pretty good deal. I was definitely making compensation and perks to make it worthwhile.

Back then, just a few years ago, the ""turn off your phone and email outside of work hours"" was a bit more of a radical idea than it is now. I think there has been a positive change in general worker culture, in a short time. I hope it can continue despite pushback from managers who want the control that they used to have.",40,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF29CA30>

That the caller is calling in cause she is trying to reformat the company provided laptop but unable to cause asking for the password to get in to BIOS. The coworker asked a follow up question on the reason on why need to reformat. 

This is the part we started laughing. That she liked the laptop so much she likes to make it her personal laptop and to do so she needs password for bios for reformatting. Our lead was upset same time laughing about the call. Said to asked of she have permission from her direct manager to do so cause every company provided equipment is recorded in the company inventory.

She answered no and reasoned out that since she is retiring that the company no longer needs the laptop. My coworker informed her she needs to reach out to her direct manager if she wants the laptop or if she didn't this would be charged as theft if she didn't return the laptop. She realize her mistake and went to her direct manager.

275,"""We have never had wifi in this building""","Medium one tonight. But one of so many from a former employer.....

I was unfortunate enough to be hired onto a company about two months before covid hit my country. I was certain I would be let go. Low and behold, I wasn't. But for a very unpleasant reason. But that story is for another time. For now, just know this company outsourced their IT. But didn't really know why they did it or what exactly was outsourced. 

When we went to remote work we had downsized to just our HQ (we used to have one other office site further into town). During that time, I was tasked with going down once a week when no one was there and assist with getting zoom calls set up in various offices so other team members could use them when it was their turn to come to the office. It was beyond simple, and kind of a waste of time. 

However, on my first day at HQ, I pop open my laptop and notice I don't see a network with a name that I am used to for this company. But I do see a few wifi printers, some weak signals that are likely from the neighboring companies, and then a full signal ""admin"" network. My first thought ""oh God, please no"" 

So I call my new boss (former boss who I only had for a month was let go due to covid) and ask what wifi network is used at the office and what the password is. She paused and says she doesn't know as she has never been to HQ. And that I should call person X as they worked out of that office full time. 

I call person X and below is that conversation. 

Me: Hey X do you know the wifi and password for HQ?

X: HQ doesn't have wifi

Me, confused now, but starting to piece together a scary fact. 

Me: ok so we're all the PC hard wired? 

X: Nope

Me: ok, then how did you get to the internet when you were here. 

X: I used Chrome 

Me: but.... You know nevermind I think I found what I need. 

I hang up, realizing I was on my own here. 

I look at the ""admin"" SSID and say f*** it. Click it ""password required"". I type in 'admin'. 

Connected.

I call the outsource IT company and they confirm that was indeed the network for the building and they premap all laptops and PC to that network to automatically connected when they set up a new user. I ask why the password and network were still factory admin settings? 

Their response:

They didn't ask us to change it.",142,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF29CBB0>

I advised him to check with his hiring manager, who routed the situation back to me asking for work-arounds. And so we did. He was granted authorization to access a shared mailbox on a shared computer for all team communication. For secondary authentication, instead of an app on his phone, he now receives a phone call with a code to enter. We got him an external hard-drive that we back-up each week so he doesn’t need to connect to the internet all the time.

278,MX Lookup failed,"A certain first line tech in my org is known for being a chatterbox but not so hot technically. They get on great with customers and do plenty of work, which more than makes up for it.

One day an email he'd sent to his wife was returned as undeliverable. 
They still used an address with a long defunct ISP. Back in the day, this ISP gave each customer their own subdomain, resulting in an entire family's having addresses like firstname@lastname.isp.com

*""I hope they aren't finally killing off my old ISP""*
*""Is there something wrong with DNS?""*
*""Are you blocking personal mail now??""*

279,Short story about one of my favorite users,"Hi everyone!

Here is a short tale from one of my favorite users, referred to as Carl from here onwards (not their name).

As a quick background, I do tech support for a software. Carl, one of the clients, was trying to use the software to replicate the results of a journal publication using two different workflows –think of it as a validation study. 

However, Carl ran into difficulties at one point and dropped me a message. It's been a while, but here is how the conversation roughly went:

**Carl:** ‘Hi, I’m trying to use two different workflows to achieve the results from *<journal publication>*. By using the *<first workflow>*, I am getting almost perfect results, but with the *<second workflow>* the results are vastly different. Could something be acting up?’

**Me:** ‘Hi Carl, this is OP. Thanks for reporting, I will have a look if I can find something unusual.’

At this point, I remoted in to see what was happening, since I would not expect major accuracy differences between the two workflows. Not as much as Carl was reporting, anyway. After spending a couple of minutes comparing the configurations from both workflows, I notice that Carl has three settings that are different. I decide to get more information.

**Me:** ‘Just to make sure: are you looking to analyze the same scenario with both workflows, or are you looking at two different scenarios?’

**Carl:** ‘I am looking to analyze the same scenario and obtain the same results in this exercise.’

For some reason, Carl mixed settings from another project that they were running into the second workflow, which caused the results to be unexpected. 

After informing him of that, Carl goes ‘Oops, sorry I fucked up. I must have mixed settings from a different project, thanks for spotting that! Have a nice evening!’

The entire interaction took less than 10 minutes. Carl never fails to be courteous/helpful, and it always puts a smile on my face when I see them around.",13,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF29CD30>
280,Water Water Everywhere,"I have worked in the computer IT field for quite a while now (my first programming was on a Z80 processor based computer) and I'm still amazed by some of the things that happen to/because of the user(s).

A case in point: Several years ago I was working for a department at a large university and my phone was ringing as I unlocked my office door one morning. Client stated that when she started her computer that morning that the mouse was ""going crazy and menus were opening and closing randomly on the desktop."" I had heard around that time of a virus that supposedly deleted icons from the desktop and did other random bad things (I honestly don't remember now, it has been quite a while ago) so I told her I would be right there.

Arriving at her office sure enough, it was as she stated. Mouse moving randomly around the screen, menus opening and closing, trains derailing, planes crashing, women having babies, and other random stuff was happening! I immediately reached for the power button and performed a hard shutdown.

As I sat there contemplating what might have caused this I happened to see the water bottle on her desk...on its side...right over the keyboard tray. I turn and look her right in the eye as I reach down pick up the water bottle and set it upright on her desk.

Her: ""I saw a few drops of water on the keyboard this morning but I wiped it off. Do you think that might have been the problem?""

Me: Still looking at her as I reach down, pick up the keyboard, and let the water drain out. ""Yes, I think this might be the problem. I'll be right back.""

A quick trip to the supply room and a new keyboard later and all was right once again.

She did try to lay the blame on the cleaning staff which I didn't buy for a second, cleaning staff never did anymore than empty the trash and did not ever dust the desks. I just told her that to make sure this did not happen again to NEVER leave an uncapped drink or liquid on her desk.

281,"TFTS ""Why is the projector not working?!? All Tech people are useless!!!""","So backstory, I used to work as a Librarian for a Tafe, at a Regional Campus. Because this campus was so far away from the main ones, I was also the unofficial tech support (even though I had no training or admin access). IT only came to visit after a certain number of jobs were logged or new tech had to be installed. Generally, it wasn't hard work, mostly ""user errors"" like forgetting passwords or accidentally turning off their own WiFi. To quote IT Crowd ""Have you turned it off and on again?"", that kinda stuff.

One particular day I had a teacher come storming into the library demanding I follow her back to her classroom. She was ranting even before she got to the loans desk where I was sitting. Something about old tech and how things weren't good enough and as the tech person I should fix it right away (I'm not tech.... grrrr). For the record, this teacher is known for being technologically incompetent. She once yanked all the cords out of the back of a computer because she didn't realize her youtube video was on silent......

Customer service smile activate!! I ask what's the issue and she proceeds to tell me (in between personal jabs at my supposed incompetence) that the screen is out of focus and nothing she does will fix it. I ask her which room she's in and find out it's one of the new machines that had just been installed the day before. I have a feeling I know what's wrong because this isn't the first time today I've fixed this issue for a much nicer teacher, so follow her to her class.

All her students are just sitting there chatting and look up as we walk in. The teacher heads straight to the front of the class and starts messing with the computer. I ask if she checked the machine, and she said ""No! Don't be stupid! It was too high."" It's attached to the roof, so for someone like me (5""2), I would need a chair to stand on to reach it, but there were plenty of tall students in this class. Looking around  I spot the tallest student I ask him to please give me a hand.

After he comes over I point to the machine and simply say ""Could you take the cap off the front? IT must have left it on when they installed it"". The image cleared up right away. The students all start laughing because up until this point, their teacher had still been going on about how all the tech people and machines, were totally useless and are idiots.

I just smiled, and walked at the door, trying to sound not too sarcastic ""I'm not Tech, but if you need any more help you can find me in the Library"" lol",47,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF29CDF0>
282,"""I want all our DLs to be internal use only!""","Hi TFTS, been a while since I've posted but have enjoyed reading all your adventures as always. A recent post by u/BlakeBlack9 just reminded me about this ticket from last week.

One of our clients started getting quite a bit of spam recently, more so than usual, but luckily the really bad type of spam so it's really obvious even to the more... not tech literate staff. The really bad thing however is that the spam wasn't going to individual users but to their Distribution Lists (they have quite a few, most are internal use only, but some need to receive outside reports). One such DL they have is an All Staff where every other DL is added. 

For whatever historical reasons this was not set to be internal only from the start, I blame my old colleague for that and also the client who probably agreed to leave it as such (they didn't really have a proper CTO back then and was a bit hectic). So you can imagine when one phishing email suddenly goes to over 500 users is a bad thing.

Queue the actual dialogue, I get a ticket from big boss man's $PA to let us know of the email. I proceed with my usual Search & Purge from the portal and then ask:

$Me: Hey $PA, do you guys really need this All Staff to be open to public? It would be much safer to make this internal use only.

Now I don't get a reply for 5 days, the week passes and next week a ticket comes in (follow-up to original):

$PA: Hey $IT_Helpdesk, I have spoken with $CEO, please make ALL our distribution lists internal only.

Now, like I said before. Most DLs already are private, but some ABSOLUTELY need to be public for very important results and reports from 3rd parties. One specific DL belonging to a certain *big money making* department would be devastated if even 1 of their results doesn't come through, and they deal with about 30-50 a minute.

The catch: I was on lunch and one of our newer colleagues picked this up. In terms of the task required, he definitely has the knowledge and access to do it. But as always it's not that cut and dry.

By pure chance I'm coming back in the office and passing by my new colleague and see the ticket he's dealing with and to bring him a coffee (I felt generous that day and got the office a coffee from the nice place on the corner). Lo and behold, I nearly dropped the tray and shouted STOP! Poor guy flinched like I was gonna throw the coffee on his crotch. He had just started making the DLs private and was just about to do the very important department one. Phew, you have no idea how I went from being chilly coming from outside to sweating like a Fin in a sauna.

I apologize to my guy for shouting and explain what he was just about to do. Queue his face going pale °_°. I asked him if he didn't mind assigning the ticket to me as I was dealing with it last week and I can put him on as a follower. So now to reply.

$Me: $PA, are you sure about that? Department X would literally implode and $Manager there would not only chew my head off but $CEO's too, and you know he will. It would mean £££££ lost in profits for just a few minutes of lost emails alone.

2 mins later. $PA: Hold on a minute, let me check with $CEO and $Manager....

10 minutes later...

I get a reply from CTO in the ticket chain. $CTO: Hey $Me, ignore that please. Make All Staff private for now as well as DL X and Y, those don't get anything external. Please leave A, B and C public and put a note to say they are to NEVER be made private lest we don't want to get paid that month. (This wasn't meant as a threat, she meant it as the loss of profits would cripple them a bit kind of joke. I personally know CTO and she has a good sense of humour along with a good head on her shoulders)

And so I do and make the description say that on the DL. ""If you make this DL private we don't get paid by client!"" Hopefully this will help the future generations at the company not make the mistake my colleague was about to.

That's it for now. I've got quite a few more interesting ones I'm hoping to find time this weekend to format and remember but also starting a new job next week, so I look forward to amusing you with stories from there at some point.


Edit: woaaah, thank you kind strangers for the Gold and Silver. 

Also, thank you all for the help in differentiating queue from cue. I get it now and I'll definitely remember it next time i type but for now I'll leave the original unedited, at least for comedic value.

283,Military IT,"This didn’t happen to me but i was told it actually happened and cost the military a lot of money.

Background info. 
So to get internet in remote places we use portable satellite. Think star link size dish. At one point we, junior enlisted soldiers straight out of high school, could adjust the power of our star link to get better signal strength whenever we wanted to. Think of the dish on the satellites as flashlights and turning up the power can hide the light from other flashlights. The military uses some of the same satellites that major streaming companies use. Officers really like being in VTC meetings during the middle of storms.

The story goes a SPC who was most likely 20-21 is deployed supporting users. Officer complains that the internet is down and he needs to attend a very important VTC meeting in 30 minutes so he can tell his how much fun they’re having.

SPC: Sir there’s a bad thunderstorm and heavy cloud coverage I’ve already adjusted the power some but our connection is still too weak.

Officer: I don’t care if you have to blast a hole in the sky I need to be in the VTC! Get it done or I’m going to tell your boss that you can do your job.

SPC: roger sir.

The SPC then proceeds to bump up the power even more and manages to get the internet back up and the officer gets into his VTC. I forget how long it took but some point later they get a frantic call from the people that manage the satellites in the sky for the military. Apparently when the SPC bumped up the power he didn’t just connect to the satellite but managed to turn up the power so much they were jamming other people from connecting to that satellite one of which was a multimillion dollar streaming/movie company. Luckily they were only jamming others for maybe 30 minutes  score the power went down automatically when the storm cleared up but that was 30 minutes of lost revenue for the major streaming company. Soon after we were no longer able to adjust the power and had to call another group to adjust the power themselves.",64,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF29CEB0>
284,Why did you do what I asked you to do?,"So last week I get an email from a manager at one of our clients, about creating a new mail distribution group for a set of users. At the bottom of their email, they added ""Please remove everybody from \[existing mail distribution group\] except myself"". So I email them back and asked them to confirm that they actually wanted everyone except themselves removed from this distribution group (used to contact an entire team that he manages). He responds almost immediately that I was indeed to cull the existing group.

I then go ahead and complete his request and move on to other tickets. Assuming that maybe no one send emails to the whole team anymore, or the team was dissolved or will be replaced.

Later that day the manager sends me a request to remove two users from a distribution group that did not exist. He did not reply to my confusion about what the email address is for the group he is now talking about, since I cannot find it.

Fast forward to today, when I receive one ticket to add someone to the previously culled group, one one reporting that no one from the team are receiving the emails sent to the culled group. So I give the manager a call to ask why users are requesting to be added to this group that I had removed everyone from and from there it went something like this:

Manager: ""Everyone should be in there.""

Me: ""Well I removed everyone last week.""

Manager: ""Why did you do that?""

Me: ""Because that's what you asked me to do in your email last week...""

Manager: ""No, I only asked you to remove a couple of people from it.""

Me:"" Your email about those users did not refer to \[culled distribution group\]""

Manager: ""We must have crossed wires, because I did not mean for everyone to be removed""

Me: ""We definitely had a miscommunication there. I will restore the users that were removed, except for User1 and User2 that you mentioned in that later email.

Manger: ""Thank you"" \*clunk\*

So I put everyone back in the group and close the job. A while later I get a Teams message from my boss who confirms for me that the manager was crystal clear in both emails that they wanted to cull the distribution group of all users, causing his whole team to stop receiving emails for almost a whole week...

I probably should have pointed out that following his request would prevent his team from from receiving emails addressed to everyone, but the manager was so specific in both of their emails that I assumed they knew what they wanted.

286,The Printer of the Gods,"Public schools again. Two weeks ago we came back from Xmas break. Teacher's computer won't load windows. Blue screen etc. Auto repair won't work. The usual deal. The CMOS battery had died. This happens quite often because we have old ""Frankensteined"" machines. Well, I go into this guy's room at the end of the day. He'd already left. I replaced the CMOS, re-seated the RAM, tried different settings in BIOS and some other stuff. No matter what I kept getting inaccessible boot device. I probably could have eventually got it to work, but I'm wasn't spending all night on this. I went ahead and reimaged it.

The next morning I get a call from my boss. What happened to this guy's PC? He's very upset. All his data is gone. I explain the situation. My boss is kinda spineless and sends an email to him explaining what happened.  It was worded in such a way though that it almost seemed like my fault. We constantly tell these people to use one drive or flash drive and they just refuse.

That afternoon this guy submits a work order for his printer. He wants me to look at it. He's quite vague about the issue. It was a Brother and it was already recognized. Maybe I messed that up though. He's in his room when I arrive.

Teacher (in a smart ass tone): So, you couldn't get all my data, eh?

Me: Nope. The OS/drivers were corrupted. I had to reload windows. These PCs are not reliable that is why we always stress to everyone that they save their data.

Teacher: Then explain this.

He proceeds to pull out a few printed class work sheets.

Me: What about them?

Teacher: Well, when I came in this morning and turned on my printer they printed out.

Me (immediately realizing what is going on): Did you try printing something on the last day of school before break?

Teacher: Well, yeah and the printer wouldn't work. I was going to put in a work order when we came back, but then my PC wouldn't even work. So, my data must still be on this computer because it printed it out this morning. I need you to get it back on immediately. That's 3 years worth of documents.

&#x200B;

I proceed to explain to him that the print jobs were held in the printer's own print queue. That doesn't mean all his data is still on the PC let alone on the printer. He argues for a moment then just gives up.

&#x200B;

I get it that he doesn't understand how all this works, but instead of just talking to me he went directly to my boss. Also, he's a grown man. Show some personal responsibility. Yeesh.

Edit: I should have mentioned that our official Technology Handbook™, that is given to everyone at the start of the school year, states the user is solely responsible for their data.",93,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF29CFD0>
287,The docking station that isn't there,"This one just happened an hour ago, I'm still confused.

I reached out to a user today who was having some issues with a desk setup. They are in another province, and asked if we could just message and not call. No biggie. For around 40 minutes, I ask every question you could think of. Is there power? Are the monitors on? Unplug the cables etc. I asked about their docking station, and run through the same things. It's on, plugged in, cords in the right spot. Literally at a loss as why nothing is working here. A co-worker went to their desk and found out she left the docking station at home. I cannot phathom how we spent all this time and the monitors were just just not plugged into anything, and she told me they were.

288,Never Trust Jane ! Always have a backup,"So my story from today, I work in IT support for a electrical manufacturing company. We have various clients in different industries one being a traffic light company who we manufacture majority of their traffic lights. I’ve been at this company 5+ years so I know majority  of the system very well. 

Every year for this traffic light company we re cost all of the components that go into a traffic light, believe it or not there’s nearly 1000. For this exercise each year the account manager Dave (Fake name) asks me to clear down the current costs and create a new quote copy some of the data over and then point the system at the new quote so they can start re costing. Since the first year I’ve started I’ve taken this task on and it happens once a year. I have script which does majority of leg work but even with good comments and guide on how to use it still takes me a good 30 mins - 1 hour just to check it all over. 

This year Jane (Fake name) raises the log to have this work done. Janes fairly experienced and quite high up and she’s been in the job probably 3 years so she’s not a newbie. I do my normal checks everything looks fine but for some reason my instinct tells me to back up the data before as the script zeros all the figures and we don’t take regular back ups of it. Bare in mind I’ve done this task for 4 years un assisted and never taken a back up.

I commit the change, close the log and an hour later Jane messages me saying she didn’t want me to change it over yet and that now all the figures are zero. I reply you didn’t specify that in your log and worded it as you wanted it doing. She’s apologies and asks for the data to be restored. Now in my head the thought does cross my mind should I say tough shit Jane it’s all gone and then for them to spend probably a day to re input the data. But I keep my layer of professionalism and restore the data and revert my work which takes all of 5 mins to do. 

Jane apologies again after I confirmed it’s restored I do the general oh no worries response. After 5+ years this is first time I’ve really noticed an instinct decision to really come and save me/Jane/The company. FYI this was a half million pound order so no small feat. I left the situation with even less trust for Jane and bit of an ego boost for being a genius for taking a back up.",26,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF29D0D0>
289,The time I should have walked away but didn't.,"There are no heroes in this story. There are no villains either, there are just people.

This is the story of a kid who knew just enough to get himself into trouble, the people who didn't believe him, and his forced pilgrimage through the valley of ignorance.

I've never officially been a sysadmin, I've just been an enthusiast/clandestine IT department since before the art of Google-fu was invented. I came into my skills in the traditional way: push buttons and something happens, push *more* buttons and *more* things happen until it's 4:30 and you're frantically learning to reinstall the operating system before your parents get home from work. Allegedly.

Over the years I've dabbled in paid work to cover bills and fixed stuff wherever I was working at the time but I have always been honest about where my skillset begins and ends. Pride doesn't recover data after all. But you fix enough systems, get enough of a reputation, and over time people stop believing that there are things you *can't* do.

This is the story of the time *I* stopped believing I couldn't do something either.

---

I had just started learning about RAID because I liked the idea of having a little redundancy in my life. I'd never lost a hard drive before but let's just say that I *did* learn to make proper backups at a young age! After some research I decided that the spooky action at a distance known as RAID10 was the way to go. So I set it up, miraculously without errors, and life was  better. For a while.

One day I was visiting one of the shops I helped out every now and then. As soon as the manager saw me he came running out and dragged me into the back. It turned out that they, too, had set up RAID10 at some point. Cool. And it turned out that one of the drives had failed and another was starting to give errors. Okay, not as cool, but my at-the-time knowledge told me that while this was a bad situation we could still recover from it. I offered to swap out the dead drive and come back the next day to swap the other once the rebuild had finished. Easy peasy, right?

The next day was the day I learned RAID is not immune to data errors, especially if a bad drive goes unnoticed for long enough. After about four hours of looking up error codes and messages I didn't even know existed I knew I was in over my head. No matter how I looked at it, the only solution was to pull *everything* off the server, rebuild the whole array and slap the data back on. This situation was way above my pay grade so I did the only thing I could: I told the manager to find someone else to finish the job.

Unfortunately the manager wasn't having any of it. I was accused of being lazy, ignoring my smaller clients and various other slurs against my skills and ethics. If I was who I am now I would have told him which slot to stick that dead hard drive into and never looked back but I was young and frankly a bit scared, so I promised to do ""whatever it takes"" to get them back up and running.

""Whatever it takes"" involved two more days of reading and writing notes, degrading *my* array to have a large enough drive to copy all their data onto and praying to various deities to protect their data while I was away from it. The patient lived in the end, but a part of me died in that room. I never took payment for that job and never worked for that client again but honestly, I think I got off easy.

I knew I didn't know everything when I walked into that situation and should have said so from the beginning; I didn't know how big ""everything"" was until it was too late to back out. But despite the sleepless nights that experience caused I am thankful for it overall, because it taught me to do my research *before* I'm up to my ass in alligators.

TL;DR:  When an expert tells you to find someone more qualified you should listen, especially when you're the expert who said it.",17,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF29D130>
290,Why does it have to be so hard???,"This literally just happened (yes I'm on Reddit at work)

I pick up the call and the lady complains that she can never log in, sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't, she just wants the issue fixed. Cool, let me get your info so I can bring everything up and see what the issue might be. 

Everything looks good on my end, so I ask her what device she's using to watch on.

Older Lady: My phone.

Me: Okay, are you using the app or the browser?

OL: Neither, I'm using (our service).

Me: ... Yes, but are you using the app or the browser to watch on?

OL: I'm not using either! I'm using (service)!

Me: Ma'am, (service) isn't something you watch *on*, you have to use our app or a browser.

OL: UGH, I'm 71, this is so hard, why do you people make it so difficult! Uhm... I think I use to use chr- uhm, Safari before? I don't know, I just press on it and it takes me to (service)!

So I have to explain to her that Safari is trash (and extra trash when you're trying to watch videos) and that she needs to download our app instead. I walk her through the steps (she said she wasn't going to do it with me on the phone) to download the app and tell her how to sign in.

Me: It looks like it was just set up here recently, so that's probably why you've been having issues.

OL: No, I did it months ago!

291,Reprimanded for using vocabulary a manager didn't understand.,"Apologies for length...you've been warned.

So, several years ago I was in a role that required imaging and building systems.  Thankfully we used a commercial product that was able to network boot systems, lay down a baseline OS, then install software packages, updates, configuration files, corporate settings, etc.   It worked quite well after I'd spent some time with the product, and on average a complete system build could be completed in under an hour ( under 45 minutes on average).  A few tweaks for the individual users were needed afterwards, but these took about 5-10 minutes and worked nearly automatically.  IE, a desktop tech sets up the build process, clicks 'GO' and watches/waits for the system to complete while answering email, gets coffee...whatever.  They built a few dozen systems daily.  I worked with the server and system build team and had little to do or nothing to do with delivering systems to actual users, that was desktop support.

A few months go by and a manager for the desktop support group (we'll call her 'P') faces criticism that her group takes much too long to get systems to users; sometimes this was a few days, but sometimes a week or more.  I'd heard complaints from her staff they'd been forbidden to deploy **ANY system to ANY user** prior to either her or her assistant having a look at the systems and reviewing them for approval. *This is where the days long delay stemmed*.  This of course made **NO SENSE WHATSOVER** since each system had been built using the **EXACT SAME** process and were identical except hostnames and serial #'s.  It was like insisting every individual muffin from a bakery faced inspection before hitting the shelf.  This manager didn't face criticism very well and refused to acknowledge her individual approval was a waste of time and needlessly repetitive.  So, she blamed the build process for taking too long.  Uhh, WTF?  The build takes less than an hour and a single technician could do about 6 simultaneously.

So, of course, a meeting is called to see what (if anything) can be done to ""speed up the build process"" and reduce the delays being complained about.  As the meeting starts, I mention I've brought a laptop and have hooked it into a projector so we can all witness the build process and attendees can actually watch it run while we 'talk'; and I've brought a stopwatch as well.  The manager goes into a diatribe about customer service, improving processes, collaboration between teams, yada, yada while people keep glancing at the projected build process flying by without my touching a thing.

This is where it gets...'weird'.  After nearly 30 minutes of her rambling, I'm finally allowed to pose a question and I ask politely ""**Excuse me 'P', but where did you get the idea that the build process was to blame?  What was the impetus of the idea that the automatic build took too long and is the cause of these delays?**""  Almost on cue, the laptop going through the build rebooted to finish off the last few installations and did a system chime/bing! showing it was restarting.  She was startled and asked ""**What was that!?!?**"".  I answered it was the laptop finishing off the build and, oh by the way, according to the stopwatch we're about 33 minutes into the meeting when I started the process.  She was livid and demanded to know why I was using ""obscene language""?

Everyone in the meeting went silent and turned with quizzical faces toward manager 'P'.  I paused, not sure what the hell she was talking about and asked ""**Excuse me, what obscene language?**""  She replied she wasn't going to repeat it but was sure everyone else had heard me.  Everyone started looking at each other and again back to manager 'P'.  As politely as I could I asked ""**'P' I'm not quite sure what language you're referring to, but as we can all see the system build is nearly done, we're not quite 40 mins into the meeting according to the stop watch and EVERY system is built using the same process, so could we possibly considering the necessity to review EVERY system before it goes out to staff?**""  After some time, she relented that she'd reduce the reviews to a system a week to '*make sure we're building the systems right*' and her comment about language seemed to fade.

A day later, I'm pulled into my manager's office and told I was being cited for using 'inappropriate language' during the previous meeting.  I'm shocked.  ""**What language, can anyone tell me what I said that was inappropriate?!?!**""  I'm told that manager 'P' stated I'd thought her idea was without merit and used a 'sexual innuendo' to get a reaction.  Huh?  WTF?@!  So I ask ""**What 'sexual innuendo' ?**""  The manager coughs and mutters ""**She said, that you said, her idea was 'impotent'...**"" .  My jaw dropped and CAREFULLY I explain EXACTLY what I'd in fact said was ""**What was the ->IMPETUS<- of the idea...**""  The manager closes his eyes and shakes his head, ""**Okay, let me just confirm with someone else at the meeting and we can put this to rest**.""

A day later, my manager confirmed what I'd in fact asked about in the meeting and had to have a polite, but rather awkward, conversation with manager 'P' on vocabulary.  He asked me later to ""**Please use simpler words when dealing with manager 'P', okay?**""",672,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF29D1F0>
292,"Not the time, or the place","Alright folks, I've worked at an IT helpdesk for a MSP for over a year, and I've got so many stories I don't know where to start.

Most of my encounters were while I worked in a specific department of our helpdesk, supporting school districts and their students while they did remote learning through the COVID pandemic. Usually, the student's parents would call in for them to get support (your usual Wi-Fi connection issues, laptop won't turn on, can't load this page etc.). We also worked directly with the school if the student needed to replace the laptop, for instance a shattered screen. One of my favorite calls was a parent explaining to me that her kid needed a replacement because the screen is broken and the laptop won't turn on. I asked how the laptop got damaged, so I could log it with my hardware request, and she said that her kid was playing with it and ""tried to use it as a Captain America shield"". I gave a stifled laugh-snort before I could mute my microphone. Thankfully, the parent also laughed and I went ahead with the replacement.

That constituted the majority of my calls. Many of my coworkers reported getting calls from a parent who was asking for a ""replacement power cord for the router"" or ""my kid needs help with their computer, but I'm driving to the supermarket right now"". Whenever I would hear these stories I would laugh, half believing and half thinking it was a slight exaggeration (this was my first tech support job, it never occurred to me that someone would think to call tech support for a school IT contractor asking for advice about which cable to buy for their iPhone. I learned fast.).

&#x200B;

One day, I receive a call from a nice lady, telling me that her daughter's school laptop was no longer powering on. I asked my basic questions, got information about the student, and proceeded with trying some fixes.

I asked her if she could grab the laptop, and she replied that she could not. I asked her if the daughter was in class right now, she said no. I asked her if she could have the daughter bring her the laptop, she said she could not.

Something pricked in my mind, and I asked her if she was with her daughter/the laptop right now. She said no.

She was in the hospital.

In labor.

It took me a moment to process that. I'm pretty sure my face was frozen as I tried to make some sense of the information, because my coworker looked at me funny. I asked the mother to have someone who was with her daughter call us so we can investigate the laptop, and promptly wished her ""best of luck.""

&#x200B;

From that day forward, I have never questioned the stories of other IT personnel.",24,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF29D250>
293,Every Port is the same," Another tale that has its beginning in the world of robots. On mobile, but with English keyboard. Let's see how it will work out (qwerty wth). 


We installed a new robot cell for our customer. No big deal, we do it a few times a year. Talk to the electrician about the network cable for remote connection, and tell him where to connect it. There is one single port in the cabinet with the label ""external connection"". I show it to him, and he is happy. The cable will be installed in a few days. 

A few days later. My coworker is at the customer site and has massive problems. Network timeouts, errors, interesting ip settings. For the time of the installation we use lte routers with wifi and dhcp. And the dhcp is making funny things. Then I get an idea. I ask my coworker to open the cabinet ... and he tells me there is an shiny new network cable installed. I ask him where it is plugged in, fully knowing where this is going. Yep, you guessed it right. It was plugged into the switch. We have two dhcp servers fighting which is bad enough, but also an overlapping ip range with the customer network. We pulled the cable and asked around if they had network problems... yes. For over a week and nobody had an idea why. Don't shoot the messenger. 

I want to go home... oh wait I am home ... damn...",29,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF29D2B0>
294,How many (c)licks does it take?,"I’m a volunteer for a small group of people doing awesome things for people suffering debilitating health issues. I’m always glad to help and often spend a few minutes responding to questions in my free time during my real job. 

Today though I’m almost ready to slam the phone down virtually and walk out with 🖕🖕in the air. 

I set up a new user with a cloud provider account that will get their email, online storage, calendar, etc setup.  I enter in a name, personal email address - and go. The system emails the user a welcome message, button to click, and setup a password. 

I’m at two weeks and five attempts to get this person through the basic enrollment. I’m fairly certain this person probably shouldn’t be close to a computer at this point. I spent a day carefully assessing this enrollment, ran through a couple of test enrollments, and I’m just sitting here shaking my head. 

Read. The. Welcome. Message.

I’m having anxiety contemplating setting up a screen share so I can see what the heck is going on because I get nothing useful when “it doesn’t work”. 

Thanks for listening in and take care of yourselves before others. I spent fifteen minutes abusing my treadmill before I decided to respond to the most recent email.

Take care all

Edit: update on the situation. Looks like the user had installed a CRM client that handled email and was aggressive in sorting and spam prevention. Took a few clicks around but we figured it out together and once we got the most recent reset link, they flew through the sign up without issue.

Some days maybe they’ll share those little details like: hey, we’re buying a new CRM product to use…",42,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF29D310>
295,More (default gateways) is not always better,"This happened a while ago but it's still something I should be a bit vague about even if an NDA isn't involved.

I work in a relatively niche industry within a niche. I also seem to be one of the few that has a reasonable grasp on both my industry and networking in general.

We had provided a quote for a project to provide our services to a project a couple years ago to the company that was actually providing and installing the hardware side of the equation. For various reasons they decided to do it in house instead (but never communicated that, no I'm not a jilted lover)

About 6 months after they ""finished"" the actual end user brought us into a conference call -- apparently they've been having stability issues ever since. Suppress my ""I told you so"" urge and smirk. The other company swears they can fix it, a fix is on the way, etc., etc., etc. Mmm hmm. OK.

Nearly a year later the end user has had enough and fly us out to do a survey, audit and report.

First thing I notice: The log has several million entries of ""warning"" or higher severity over the past two weeks. In a well behaved system where the configuration is unchanged there might be a handful of ""notice""s and maybe 1 or 2 ""warnings"" over the course of a month. Hmmm

Second thing I notice: The IP connection between ""my"" devices use to exchange data amongst themselves is going up and down faster than a champion yo-yo, like ""I didn't know a connection could get negotiated to the state of being considered 'up' and then F-ed up enough that it could be considered 'down' that quickly""

That's all...odd...but I'm not putting my finger on it.

Then I pull the network configuration. Ok. There are three NICs in play; not entirely uncommon with my devices needing to talk to things on otherwise isolated/landlocked single-subnet networks. But...wait... all three have a default gateway defined?! WHY WOULD YOU DO THIS?

I suppose an additional bit of information comes into play here: Based on the architecture of my devices the actual brain that generates and receives packets is behind an internal router (I use the term with velociraptor air quotes) that then sees the external ethernet interfaces. As a result the primary OS doesn't really have any routing intelligence and as far as it knows virtually all packets are destined to or originate from foreign networks, even if the 'foreign' network is physically connected to the device.

Anyway...with a little probing I figure out that one of the three doesn't exist, one doesn't have an actual route off the subnet, and one actually has routes to remote subnets that I care about(tm).

Remove the interlopers, watch things: all of my connections come up, stay up, and months later the client is happy. Meanwhile, the ""I dunna know, the IP info they gave me had a default gateway listed so I just put that in the device configuration"" continues to be a plague on my industry.

So near as I can tell with the extra default gateways the internal 'router' just choosing an interface at random to fling packets out of. Sometimes it flung them out the correct interface long enough to get a connection up... The rest of the time it just dropped them into the void.

And I've since come to really respect (some) of Cisco's stuff referring to it as the ""gateway of last resort"" -- seems to much more clearly convey the purpose. Though I guess that still requires a basic understanding of IP routing....Sigh.

TL;dr: Client suffers with an unstable system for a year because someone thought more is better.",31,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF29D370>
296,Police Cops Episode 2 - SCMODS,"I worked tech support for a small company that did public safety software - police recordkeeping, municipal court dockets and recordkeeping, evidence/property management and so on. Our customers were mostly small municipalities with small- to medium-sized police departments. Our standard package included 1-2 days of installation and configuration, usually starting on a Monday morning, and then 2-4 days of on-site training.

I did 4 days of install and training at a new police department customer's location, which was about 15 minutes away from the department in Episode 1. Everything went well, no problems with the software or the training, and on Thursday afternoon I was done. Our standard procedure before leaving was to talk with the chief or whoever was in charge of the project and make sure there were no questions or concerns. So I went to the chief's office for the talk, and found out he was happy with everything. I had been staying there in town for the project, but I was about to leave to drive the 3 hours home.

""Ok, there's just the one last thing - you need to install SCMODS on the lobby computer.""

\-----------------

Jake: SCMODS?  
Elwood: State. County. Municipal. Offender. Data. System.

\-----------------

Well it isn't called SCMODS obviously, but that's what he wanted me to do - install and configure the software to run offender data, warrant lookups, drivers licenses, license plates, etc. on a computer in the police department's lobby. This is a closed system - it connects a department to the State Police systems, which in turn interact with other state systems and with federal systems.

&#x200B;

There were a whole lot of issues with this, and here are just a few:

1. Our company was not an authorized vendor for installation of the software.

2. I didn't have and had never even seen an installation disk for the software. This wasn't something you could just go out and download.

3. Even if I had had the software, I didn't know how to configure it. You couldn't just run it, it had to be configured and the State systems at the other end also had to be configured to accept the new terminal. I certainly had no contact with anyone at the State and had no idea who to call, and they wouldn't have helped me anyway (see #1).

4. I knew that at least for stationary terminals, the department was supposed to submit an application to the State that included a blueprint or drawing of the location to show how the terminal would be physically secure, and depending on the application the State might also require a physical security audit. And I also strongly suspected there was no way this had been done.

&#x200B;

But despite all this, the salesman had told the chief we would be more than happy to install SCMODS on the lobby machine, and apparently this had sealed the deal. And this was the first I had heard of it.

I told the chief as politely as possible that not only could I not install the software, but I wouldn't touch it even if I could.

""Take it all out and issue a refund."" Sigh. I called the office and got the salesman on the phone, we'll call him Bill. The chief yelled at him for a bit and then told me Bill wanted to talk to me. Bill seemed confused as to why I couldn't install the software, but then when I finally got through to him that I didn't even have a copy of it, he finally told me he would be there in the morning. I went back to my motel and told them I needed to stay another night.

Friday morning I met Bill at the police department. He goes in and talks to the chief for a bit, and then comes back out to the lobby. He pulls a disk out of his briefcase - I have no idea where or how he obtained it - but it's a SCMODS installation disk. ""I'll have this done in a few minutes and we can go."" I had my doubts but I wanted to see the installation/configuration procedure.

We go to the lobby computer and there's just one problem. This machine is beyond ancient. It has a single 5 1/4 floppy drive. The installation disk is 3 1/2. Ok, no problem, there are other machines in the department that have one of each. We can just copy it over to a 5 1/4 disk. Ok, big problem...there are no 5 1/4 disks anywhere to be found in the department.

Ok, bigger problem, there are no 5 1/4 disks to be found in town. Or in the next town over, which has a Best Buy. Bill spends half an hour calling every computer shop within an hour's drive. No one has any, they're simply too old anymore.

So Bill gets a brilliant idea - he calls the department from Episode 1 (he had sold them their system), and sure enough they have a box that has one disk left in it. One. We go over there and pick it up, drive back to the department, copy the installation from the 3 1/2 over to the Last 5 1/4 On Earth, and go over to the lobby machine to start the SCMODS installation. Bill pops in the disk and closes the latch.

GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRIIIIIIIIIIIINNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNND. Oh. No.

The machine had been running for years, and had of course never been blown out or cleaned in any way. The drive was so full of dust, dirt, grime, grease, and who knows what else that it completely physically mangled the disk. When Bill pulled it out, it looked like the Last 5 1/4 On Earth had been run over by a farmer's tractor in a muddy field.

Bill looked at the disk. Bill looked at me. Back at the disk. Back at me. I thought maybe he was going to cry.

""Bill...I'm going home.""

I walked by the chief's office on the way out, gave him a cheerful ""Take care, Chief!"", and I left.",43,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF29D3D0>
297,“It was like that out of the box!”,"…not the first time I have heard that lie, sadly…

Best one was; customer brings in G5 iMac (flat screen display style, white plastic) for service and before the iMac even *hit* the service bench, the first words out of his mouth were…

“Ididntuseapowerdrilltotryandunscrewthecase!!!” Said rapid-fire as if to make one long, convoluted word…

I asked “what’s the issue here?”

…it just stopped working! I really didn’t try to open the case with a drill, it came that way from the factory!

I say “let me check it out” as I put down a towel and lay the iMac screen down to access the three CAPTIVE case screws along the bottom edge…

There are three perfect cone shaped piles of iron filings around the captive screws, it looked like each one was a microscopic volcanic cone, suffice to say, the screws were BEYOND stripped…

The customer kept loudly claiming innocence, that he got it that way out of the box, I told him I’d have to check the unit in, and advise him of repair status, but warned him that it was highly probable that Apple would deny warranty, as it looked like …”accidental damage” (tech speak for “you fucked it up, idiot!”) and he’d be looking at a minimum of a chassis replacement and transferring his components to the new chassis (basically rebuilding it from scratch)

He grabbed the machine and angrily stormed out, screaming that he’d take it up with Apple and he *WOULD* get it covered under warranty…

…guess who was back next week, head downcast, sad expression, said his wife ripped him a new one for damaging the new machine, and he’d appreciate if I could try to fix it, and yes, he understands it’ll be an out of warranty repair, finally admitting he might have gotten a “little excited” about attempting to upgrade the RAM himself and “might have” used a cordless drill with a Phillips bit to try and open it after all…

One replacement (out of warranty) chassis later, and the machine was back up and running, I …”may”… have also filled the screw heads with silicone sealant to discourage any further customer attempts to open the case, it wouldn’t prevent him, but it’d be evidence he tried to get it open again…

I have so many stories…

There’s the old Bondi iMac that had a flyback transformer failure that made the back case look like one of those flat plasma discs above a Borg alcove…

There’s the never ending line of brats who think the retail displays are their personal toys, the brat who thinks goldfish crackers can be consumed nasally, and left us a bunch of snotty goldfish crackers to clean up (some rubbed into the keyboard of a brand new 17” MacBook Pro) the brats who kept trying to get into the service bay (with an open and running CRT display…), the brat trying to “help” me do an analog board swap on an iMac (high voltage and greasy little fingers can be potentially bad…)

…and the woman who called in asking us to talk her through the clock (CMOS) battery replacement on a 6100 series “pizza box” PowerMac (“I’ve got the back of the *MONITOR* off and I’m poking around, but don’t see where the battery goes…”)

Actually, just recalled another one…

Customer brings in a Color LaserWriter 8500, a 130 Lb color laser printer with a rotating toner carousel, and a fuser cooled with mineral oil, generally, once these units arrive at the customer site, they are carried to the location they’ll live by FOUR people, and once set up, cannot be moved without an elaborate deinstall procedure, which involves manually pumping back the fuser oil into its tank, parking the carousel, and removing toners…

The most common missed steps with these were customers forgetting to drain the fuser oil before transport (that stuff is slipperier than buttered Teflon ball bearings in a magnetic repulsion field, I’m sure it was the basis for propulsion Gel in the Portal series) and having less than four people carrying the (leaking) printer in…

No, this o e takes the cake, an 8500 that. It only didn’t have the toners removed and the fuser oil wasn’t drained, no, this printer was *DROPPED* off the back of a truck onto pavement!

It was easier to list what *wasnt* broken (LCD display panel, basically), I mean, the *FRAME* was *WARPED!*

And these idiots wanted an *itemized repair bill and estimate* and would not listen to me when I said the unit was unrepairable, it was a total loss, Apple didn’t even have the *FRAME* as an orderable replacement part! It would be cheaper to buy a new printer!",33,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF29D430>
298,Police Cops,"I worked tech support for a small company that did public safety software - police recordkeeping, municipal court dockets and recordkeeping, evidence/property management and so on. Our customers were mostly small municipalities with small- to medium-sized police departments. Our standard package included 1-2 days of installation and configuration, usually starting on a Monday morning, and then 2-4 days of on-site training. After that any issues were handled by phone and/or email support.

One of our techs had spent a week at a new police department customer's location, and everything had gone well. The next Monday morning we get a call. It's the chief on the phone and he's hopping mad. We get the standard lines from him - ""nothing is working"", ""I don't know what's wrong"", ""there aren't any error messages, it's just broken"". He insists that we return immediately and uninstall everything and issue a refund or he's going to call the city attorney and start legal proceedings (this wasn't an uncommon threat).

Usually we can at least do some over-the-phone troubleshooting, but he's not having it. We escalate his call to the head of support, then the VP of the company, and then the president of the company. The chief wont let anyone walk him through any kind of troubleshooting, and he won't put anyone else on the phone to do so either. The president finally convinces him to at least let us come back and take a look at it.

So the president of the company comes to my office, hands me the keys to the one company car, and tells us to get going. The tech who did the install and myself get in the car and drive 3 hours to the police department.

We get there and we're ushered into the chief's office. He's sitting at his desk fuming and four other officers are there in the office with us. He starts in again about how the entire system is broken, and after some ranting we finally get to start troubleshooting. His machine is on the software's login screen.

""Ok Chief, please show us what's going on - it's on the login screen so let's type in your login.""

The chief types in his badge number.

""Ok, now hit the tab key and type in your password.""

He yells at the top of his lungs, ""That's the go\*\*\*mn problem! I can't remember it!""

There's about 10 seconds of silence. The officers suddenly look very embarrassed - they didn't know what the problem was either, all they knew prior to our arrival was that ""it isn't working"".

Then one of the officers speaks up. ""Hey Chief, remember? Our passwords are our last names.""

The chief types in his last name and hits Enter. Everything works just as it should.

""Oh, OK. Well, thanks for coming by fellas!"" And we were quickly ushered back out to the parking lot for our 3 hour drive back to the office.",111,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF29D490>

300,The heavens themselves decree: NO INTERNET FOR YOU!,"So, on mobile and first time submitting here (I think, maybe I did back in 2014 or so). Obviously there shouldn't be any information here that's against the rules, but it IS a unique situation, so if someone recognizes this from a certain company, please shhhh. Tl;dr located at the end.

I used to do level 1 tech support for an ISP. Now, this wasn't what we know Level 1 to be in our current day. This was somewhere between levels 2 and 3. We were empowered to go off script, make our own judgment calls, and even look for extremely odd solutions, so long as we didn't troubleshoot anything directly outside our product. We couldn't set up a new computer from scratch, but we could help configure your browser and get your email client connected to our web server. It was paradise (until they tried to be more like Bigger Shitty Cable ISP. No, not THAT one. The other one). I only say this because I'd never have started on the back side if I was following a standard script. May not even have gotten to the fun bit at all.

I had a no-internet call come in from someone after a rather large storm, so I was already primed to troubleshoot modem and outside-the-house connectivity issues. Sure enough, no internet on any devices. Let's check on that modem...

**User** - ""Oh that's out in the shed, hang on!""

Ah, of course, I thought. Must be some water damage, leaked in from the storm-

**User** - ""WELL I'LL BE! THERE'S A HOLE IN MY ROOF!""

I clarified that there was indeed a hole in his roof, a rather large one. He also claimed that there was a big 'rock' sitting directly where his modem was... in the wreckage of the modem. On further questioning, the rock wasn't actually that big, about the size of a golf ball, maybe less.

Still, the modem, the table it was on, and the roof were destroyed. The storm was rough, but surely, SURELY, the wind wasn't strong enough to have flung this rock like this...

I informed the caller that he should wait for our tech to come out and assess the damage. I also told him that it MIGHT be a meteorite, but more than likely it was a normal rock. Either way, he should consider calling some people to find out. Apparently some folks pay good money for that sort of thing. 

I flagged the ticket so I could check in on it,and when the day came for a tech to roll out there, I emailed them asking to look at the rock and send me a picture. In the end, the customer had to get the city out to repair the power lines before we could help fully, but we did set out a new modem. Also, the customer gave the ~~meteor~~ rock to the tech claiming it was bad luck. No idea what happened after since we usually didn't contact field techs directly and he was contracted.

tl;dr: A possible meteor fell through someone's roof and precision-striked their modem, killing their service.",6,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF01AA60>

At that point, I begin calling building principals one at a time with more details letting them know to calm staff.  Teachers are entering grades and are pretty much free to leave for the summer once that is down. The server with student information and grades is in the data center.  

I really don't know the fire situation but can hear fire trucks rolling up.  I get my calls made and head out to access everything. Luckily this happened during office hours according to the fire department chief.  He said after-hours would have resulted in a much bigger issue.  

I am pretty good at managing chaos and text messaged the owner of the electrical contractor we have often used at school asking him to send someone over right away.  He did and also came himself.  The owner and fire chief diagnosed the issue as the main feed line to this panel had become loose and began arcing.  There wasn't enough time for the fire to spread beyond the electrical system.  The wall was charred but okay.  The electrical wires were melted up through the conduit.  It was going to be several days to repair the disaster.  

Luckily the data center had one large UPS to run all of the equipment besides the AC unit. It could last about 4 hours and I liked to have 45 minutes to an hour before shutting it all down. The electrical contractor told me he could run a new temporary line across the floor and have it done before I needed to shut anything down. This was before virtualization so I shed as much load as possible right away.  

It had been about an hour since my first email so I went back to my desk and still had some time on my smaller UPS to look at my email.  There was a considerable amount of blowback from teachers about the downtime and how I was going to be personably responsible for them being unable to get their grades in (and go home for the summer).  A few even called and left angry voicemails.  I wrote a second email explaining the situation in detail and that we were working to deliver temporary power to the data center hoping to keep downtime to a minimum.  I assured them everything was being done.  

Still, a few thought it was necessary to explain that any downtime was unacceptable and would not be tolerated.  The good news is the contractor came through with temporary power and there was no downtime. Also nice is I received many emails thanking me for the information and updates and making sure things were as painless as possible.  

It took three days to make full repairs. The district office staff worked from laptops in a conference room near the data center during that time.  Also, nobody ever painted the charred wall and it has been more than ten years.",64,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF29D760>
303,Network Nightmare,"So I work for an IT company that does the tier 1 support for other companies. We handle a variety of clients in different fields from manufacturing cranes to hospitals. Now I've been the lead guy on nights for a good long time and exactly 1 time in the last 6 years I had to join in on what was called an IRT call for a hospital system (not sure what IRT stands for probably like Instant Response Team). Now these calls happen all the time when there is a major outage of any kind and when you are dealing with a hospital system things have to get fixed fast. Usually what happens is I get notified that an IRT call is about to start and I call my boss and he comes and joins the call so I can stay on the phone. So here is what happened we started getting calls about computers not connecting the network across like 5 hospitals which is a pretty big deal when dealing with hospitals, a lot of stuff like test results just get updated to charts but now an already understaffed and overworked hospital needs to spare people to run around a hospital gathering information from other departments. So I call our network on call who decides to start an IRT, I try calling my boss, the other boss  their boss, their bosses boss no one is answering my phone calls but we need a representative on the IRT which defaults to me. So I get on a call with a bunch of Department heads, the companies CIO, other bigwigs that can demand I get fired if they so choose and its like 3 am so none of them are in a particularly good mood. So basically it was my job to relay instructions to the service desk and relay any relevant information on to the call. So the first thing that we figure out is that its only wireless devices that wont connect, all wired computers are working just fine. It takes about an hour but we figured out that the main cause of this issue is that someone had checked out a set of credentials from a vault without permission and created a change to the Group Policy that accidentally removed permission for access to wifi. So they had to find some way to get people on site and connect them long enough to force a gpupdate, on every wireless device across 5 hospitals spread across multiple counties on top of Doctors Offices, Pharmacies, warehouses, the list goes on. Somebody definitely got fired for that one, fortunately it wasn't me.

&#x200B;

TL:DR Somebody tried to make a minor change to Group Policy and Knocked several computers offline in a way that required someone to go to each computer and manually fix it.",17,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF29D9A0>

305,Post re-model setup took a turn,"LTL, FTP here and while sitting in a train I happened to think about the following situation a few years back  


Me - Me (Av Tech, now engineer)  
Cow1 - Coworker 1  
LBC - Large Business Customer (BIG Money)

Cow1 gets a call from LBC who explains that a section of a soccer stadium was remodelled during summertime and the external techs took out our installed tech (all 19"" rack mounted: Sennheiser Mic Port, DVD Player, a few Video and Audio I/Os, a power strip) out and ask us to reinstall it to make sure it works on the first game day 3 days in the future.  


Cow1 sends me over to the place, shouldn't take more than an hour as everything is labelled and plug-ready like VGA and HDMI Cords, Power cords, some BNC cable connectors and the likes. Important: everything was pluggable and live.

When I got there I was ... surprised. The old tech cabinet was moved about 5 meters within the room, cool, looked good. Then the terror: The remodelling crew cut (!!!) all cords right at the point where the came from the ground. They left maybe 5 cm / 2 inches of cable coming out the floor. The pluggable cables. Cut.   
And if you every repaired an HDMI or VGA cable you know it is a pain!  


Called Cow1 and LBC, LBC shook it off and said its our job to get it running. the 1 hour job turned into a 2 day - 3 man job, trying to locate all cables and exchanging what was possible, running new lines and fiddling the new ones thru maybe an inch wide holes.   


Oh the fun to be working in entertainment.   
Cheers to all my fellow AV-techs and engineers!",16,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF3FF6A0>
306,"""They are cutting power to the sever room today""","I've been out of the office for about a month so the day to day happenings such as construction and desk moves etc. have not been communicated to me.   


This morning I get to the office at 7:30AM and one of the facilities guys comes up to me and casually  says:  ""The electricians are cutting power to the server room some time today"". 

Enter Panic Mode Now...

I state that they can't just turn off the power to the datacenter. there is a process that needs to happen for down time. People need to be notified, other buildings need to prepare for continued manufacturing with out access to work orders.   I start messaging management asking what the hell is happening. Management asks if we can run on the generator while power is off. I have no answer for that so I run off to find the facilities manager and electricians to ask. The electrician informs they did not need to  turn of the electricity in the server room, that they turned of the electricity off for a small portion of the front office just long enough to move that breaker up a row so they can install the breakers for the new AC unit and that they have already done it and my datacenter is safe.

307,The case of the killer floppy disk drive,"Around 1999 my brother volunteered us to build a PC for a friend of his.  He knew I'd successfully built my own PC already so he figured it would be a good idea to have me help out.  I think we were doing it in exchange for a slightly dented PlayStation, which was an excellent deal as far as we were concerned.  So his friend orders all the parts he wanted and drops the lot off at our house.  Everything is there, it all appears undamaged, and we put it all together with no issues.  First POST is fine, BIOS looks good, so we install Windows.

Some indeterminate amount of Windows time later, Windows is now installed, so its time for drivers.  Now this is back in the day, where drivers either came on a CD if it was something fancy, or on a 3.5 inch floppy disk for everything else.  We get the chipset drivers installed from a CD just fine, then it comes time for the network card drivers from a floppy.  Grab the disk from the box, pop it into the drive and... the computer resets.

>UraniumSnail: Huh, that's weird.

It starts back up ok though, and loads back into windows.  We can read data from the A: drive with no problem, so the drivers get installed.  Pop the disk out, and move onto the next drivers, also on a floppy.  Stick that into the drive and... it resets again.

>UraniumSnail: Hmmm.  I think I see a pattern.

We are both a little apprehensive at this point, as neither of us have seen an issue like this before and we're worried in case we damaged something during assembly.  We don't want to let down his friend and we really want that PlayStation, so we stop installing drivers to try and troubleshoot this floppy disk drive.  First thought is to remove things from the PC until we have the minimum set that causes the issue.  So, power down, remove network card, power back up, put disk in drive, it resets again.  Power down, remove sound card, try again, same issue.  Disconnect the CD drive, same issue.  Remove all but one stick of RAM, same issue.  Try swapping sticks of RAM around, same issue.  Disconnect the floppy drive, same issue.

>UraniumSnail: Wait.  What?

Yup, with both the power and data cables of the floppy drive disconnected from the motherboard it still causes a reset when we insert a disk.

>UraniumSnail:  W. T. F.

I'm beginning to think this disk drive is haunted.  It is literally NOT CONNECTED to the motherboard and yet it can still cause it to reset.  Ok time for a bench test.  Everything comes out of the case and onto the desk and we assemble the basics.  Power back up with the floppy disk drive cables connected...  and it works just fine.  We can pop the disk in and out as much as we like and the PC behaves itself.  Ok so now what?  We both look at each other, then simultaneously both look over at the now empty case.  Maybe it's not the disk drive that's haunted, maybe it's the case?

Everything gets unplugged from the motherboard and we reluctantly lower it into the possibly possessed case.  As we are lining up the mounting holes with the support risers though, I notice that there are more risers in the case than are necessary for this motherboard.  These days, most cases come with the risers all in a little bag, and you can screw them into the case exactly where you need them for your flavour of motherboard.  But this was much more rare back then, and to support different sizes of motherboard there were just more risers, with some in places that you didn't need them.

Now this was a standard ATX board, so we start checking the positions of the risers that we don't plan to use and seeing if any of them come close to the board.  And wouldn't you know it, just where one of the spare risers is, there is a long dangling leg of a component sticking right through the PCB.  It must stick a good 4 or 5mm off the board, and is by far the component that sticks out the furthest, and it just so happens to perfectly line up with a spare riser.  Now it didn't actually touch the riser, but it was close.  Very, very close.  And it turns out that the nice, brand new floppy disk drive with a nice, brand new mechanism full of nice, brand new springs gave enough of a CLUNK when inserting a floppy disk that the physical jolt caused the riser to momentarily touch the motherboard component leg.  Which happened to cause a reset.

So the case was taken outside and introduced to the sharp end of a hacksaw, and now minus a few risers was allowed back into the house.  Where the now exorcised case was made the home of a perfectly functional PC, which was successfully swapped a few hours later for a dented but working PlayStation.",15,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF3FF760>
308,My Little Client: Machine is Magic,">The last transaction isn't right

What?

>The last transaction out of 6 isn't right, all the details are there except the branch code. That data is missing

Does it happen on our machine?

>No

This is yet another head scratcher from our client, their machine is somehow just.... *different*, causing all sorts of complaints that end up getting fixed without us knowing what exactly was wrong and what exactly fixed it, previous adventures include:

1. A program outputting the wrong result for an entire week, it worked on our machine. Various debugging efforts failed to turn up anything, and a recompile with literally nothing changed fixed it

2. A program literally went missing. Calling it results in ""program not found"" error. It's not listed in any object list. It returned as if nothing happened the next day, nobody knew why

So I chalk this off as yet another Magical Machine's Bizzarre Misadventure. It really do be like that sometimes. But client doesn't care, the program isn't working, they want it to work

Gaining access to debug this client's machine is laborious bureaucratic effort, so it takes some time to get there. Funnily enough, we can send programs over without issue, so for the better part of the week I spent some time diagnosing what could possibly go wrong, trying possible fixes, compiling, and sending the new program over.  
All the time my tester says it works on our machine, and it's wrong on client's machine. It's kind of difficult trying to correct something that is already right, but the complaints grow louder. 

Finally I gained access to debug it, and that's when I noticed something that - for some reason - escaped me

Somehow I've been selecting data from database with the wrong qualifiers this whole time. I select, THEN set the qualifiers I needed to select, rather than the other way around

A simple change in line order fixed it. But what confused me is how, despite the program being wrong, it managed to spit out 99% correct result

In both machines

I guess it really do be like that sometimes. ¯\\_ (ツ)_/¯",45,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF3FF7C0>
309,Why can't I get online ?,"A short back story. I was working in a large BPO IT service desk voice account. This story happened to my coworker who at that time was a experienced call taker. Our callers are employees and have hardware VPN at home for work.

This is a short story since the call is short but we were laughing at it after. 

This happened during a weekend shift and there were not many calls coming in and were chatting when there are no calls. Then the call comes in to my coworker and the call was about her work computer having no connection while connected to the hardware VPN.

After our basic troubleshooting steps he determined that the issue is with their home internet having no connection. Then called went irate and started angrily saying that there should be no issue with their home internet all while in mute he was just laughing and telling me how the caller speaks while, after some time in my coworker conferenced in the caller's ISP to prove the issue is their connection not the hardware VPN. While talking with the ISP, the rep said the caller seems to have an outstanding balance not yet paid then they were transferred to their billing department. After being transferred now confirmed she didn't yet paid her interney bill, now the caller is irate to the ISP billing rep now yelling at them about it should have been paid. That's where he ended the call and closed the problem ticket since it was out of our scope.

310,How do I turn on the computer?,"I believe that's my first proper post here.

Long story short, I recently went on vacation, but $user still had my number and (because I'm too kind), I told them if they had a serious issue they could call me.

For context, I've been providing support for this user for years now, even as a youngling, well before doing IT work on the side, pretty much every machine they use has been set up and maintained by me, and every time they had a new machine, I explain to them, every day for a week, how to do things. Because apparently, changing of physical machine, even keeping a familiar, if not the same interface, as they've been using for years, makes them entirely lost as to how to ""start their email and administrative things"", aka, launch firefox and click the bookmarks.

This is most of their use, receiving, sending emails, printing and scanning, and doing tasks on administrative websites, and has been the same use for the past decade.

Well anyway, it of course didn't last long, one evening I get a call from $user...

&#x200B;

$user: ""Hey so, I gotta do this important administrative thing but I don't know how to turn on the computer""

Me: ""Wait, what?""

$user: ""There was a power outage since you left, and I don't know how to turn the computer back on""

Me: ""Well... You press the power button. Like on your previous machine. And the one before that. And your phone. And your tablet.""

$user: ""Okay, where is it?""

Me: ""Where I showed you a few times, and like every other machine you had, there is a big button on the top of the machine with the power logo, the little I in the rounded U""

$user: ""Oh! That worked! But it's asking me for a code...""

Me: ""Yes, your code, the one that we set up together that you insist to use since forever""

$user: ""Oh right. Okay. How do I get to my emails then? There is one I need to check quickly.""

Me: ""Start the web browser.""

$user: ""The what?""

Me: ""You know, Firefox, the icon with the orange fox on the taskbar.""

$user: ""The what?""

Me: ""The taskbar, it's the bar at the bottom, where you click on the programs you want to use.""

$user: ""Oh! And then what?""

Me: ""Use your bookmark at the top, like you've done for the past decade.""

$user: ""Okay! Now how do I turn it of?""

Me: \*sigh\* ""Open the start menu and click on the power icon, then shutdown.""

$user: ""The what menu?""

Me: ""The hecking menu at the bottom left, this hasn't changed for years and you've literally been using this OS on the previous machine and were able to do everything you've asked about doing for the past half an hour!"" (oh yeah, it did last that long just to read an email)

$user: ""Oh okay. Sorry I struggle with computers, they're not easy to understand. It worked though, thanks!"" \*clic\*

TRY to find something that I can blame this on, keeps happening again, and again, and again. In about a 15 minute period, it happens 6 times. At this point, Im thinking CMOS, as the time gets further and further wrong.

T: no, that's 35 hours and 30 minutes of recording time.

C: 35 hours? That's not possible, you can't put 35 hours onto there, that's not possible.

T: eh... yes it is? We've got 5TB hard drives nowadays, that's 5000GB. that's over 300 hours of recording time compared to the one you have inside of the machine. It's not too far fetched that it can contain 35 hours of recording time.

C: no, it can only contain 1 hour.

T: eh... it has 500GB in storage, it can contain significantly more than one hour.

T:.......disk? we're talking about the Hard Drive, the one that's selected at the top of the screen. not the disk....

C: yes we are talking about the disk.

T: no, we're not. The disk can hold an hour of recording time, yes, but the internal hard drive can hold 35 hours.

C: 35 hours? no, no, that's not possible.

T: the HDD inside of the machine, not the disk, the machine, can hold 500GB of data which is 35 hours of recording time.

C: that's not possible

T: we've got hard drives with terabytes upon terabytes of data, that's 1000's of gigabytes of data, yes it is.

314,But that's my coffee cup holder,"This is going to be a short,  but funny story. I'm sure other had this issue years ago. 

The incident takes place in 1997. I was at the beginning of my tech support career. I worked for a company that sold product via proprietary software that connected with a dial up modem (told you it was a long time ago). I received a call from a gentleman because our CD was not running. I started to go through all of the normal ""fixes,""  and asked needed questions. His computer was only 3 weeks old. It seemed everytime I asked him to try something on his computer, he would say ""OK hold on."" Then I would hear movement. I finally asked the guy where he was placing the CD, and he said ""Where else, in my CD player!"" I quickly realized he was attempting to run the CD on his TVs CD player. I informed him that the CD actually goes inside the CD ROM on his computer. He told me he does not have a CD ROM. I found this odd, because at that point most PCs had a CD player. So, I thought maybe he didn't realize he had one. I told him as much, and walked him through finding the CD ROM. When he pushed a button he said ""The only thing that opened was the built in coffee cup holder.""   D'OH, as you probably guessed, he thought the CD rom was a cup holder. I quickly corrected him, and was able to walk him through the setup and get him going. At the end of our call he asked ""Well, can I still use it as a cup holder if I don't ha e a CD in it?"" I told him sure, as long as he doesn't mind having to replace it or the entire computer often.

A click on the tracker tells me the error right away ""No connection was established, please make sure you have GSM signal and your tracker is turned on. You can repeat the activation process by clicking the button below.""                

So I tell her that in almost the exact same words and send her a screenshot on how to get there.                  

Around 2 hours later she replied with ""Can I just reset everything and you walk me through it if I call before 6PM?""                     

Mind you, this is a Friday and we don't even offer phone support at the moment. The mail also came in at 5:40PM. So I told her no need to reset, just follow the instructions, make sure there is signal and the device is turned on, yada yada....                     

No response until I'm officially in my weekend, so I call it a day. I'm about to close some tabs and still had her account open. She somehow managed to delete the tracker from her account which I'm not even sure how to do myself.

316,But i am working in the cloud!,"Freshly graduated i started my first tech support job with a small service provider in the Netherlands. We worked a lot with small offices and start ups, managing their networks and servers.

One day i got a call from one of our clients and it went a little something like this:

Hello (...) How can i be of assistance to you today?

Hi IT the internet is very slow can you help me?

Me: Sure (i did the standard routine into troubleshooting and came to the conclusion that the client moved the modem into a different room that blocked the wireless access a lot.

Me: could you please put the modem back to the location where we installed the device. It might be obstructing the frequency. 

Client: it should not matter we are working over the cloud! Normally when i open the windows more it gets faster but it doesnt do that now!

Me: (a bit puzzled about what she said but quickly found out that she was talking about the sky.) Ma'am opening your windows does nothing for your frequency of the office network. Please put the device back.

Client: can it be because there are no clouds in the sky right now? Maybe there is no availability?

Me: (thinking shes trolling?) Ma'am we are going to have to put the device back to its original location. We are going to send an on site engineer to your office in the coming days to get some eyes on the location.

Client: okay thank you very much

317,I need you to come move the furniture,"I work as a field tech for a company with many small offices. Usually a server and 10-15 workstations everything pretty standard. 
Had an office get remodeled. Normally there pretty strict about not dispatching me out unless I have a ticket but due to remodel we were pretty lenient knowing there might be a few minor issues after everything was set back up. This leads to the office manager emailing me the following chain 
Office manager: "" some of the desks were not put back in there correct spot please come out and move to the correct location"" 
Me: "" I apologize but you will need to talk to operations about that. Due to office remodel floor plans have changed. All tech was set up according to the floor plan I received.
Office manager: The floor plan is correct I just dont like the way the desks are facing.
After that I just forwarded her emails to my boss and the operations manager and said politely moving desks is not my job.
Cut to a month later I am now cc in a email chain with my boss, ops boss our area manager and the region head from this woman saying tech continuously ignored her requests after remodel and never came out after she was having issue.",125,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF3FFB20>
318,An Important Switch,"I recently got a position as IT/Logistics Coordinator for a higher-end retail plaza. It's some weird overlap, but there isn't much of either side to be a full workload, so whatever. What's important here is that until recently my office served as both mail and server rooms. Should also mention that I have no degree or relevant certifications, just have done electronic repair for a couple years.

Our server rack was already a clustered mess due to lazy ""fixes"" over the years, but it didn't run in to issues very often. It's old and I have no power when it comes to the money side of things. But a few weeks ago, our head administrator decided they wanted to server moved to the other side of a wall and out of my office. I'm happy for the space, and it's allowed for some much needed upgrades.

Everything was fine for a couple days after the move, until one Wednesday morning we come in to our network being down. Server seemed to have rebooted itself around 7:45am and wasn't fully up and running yet. My boss and I do some digging and it looks like some automatic updates (that shouldn't be happening) are the cause. No problem. Make sure those are off and get on with our day. Then it happens the next day and the day after. No idea, can't figure it out. Call for some assistance from our sister company as they're the ones that actually did the move, but they're clueless, as well. It's Friday. Deal with it on Monday.

Rock up on Monday morning, and lo and behold, the network is up. No reboots in sight. There is now tape over a light switch, though.

Yep, the power for that entire room is controlled by a single switch that security was flipping every night. The backups were holding out until just before I clocked in the following morning. There aren't enough brain cells in the building.",61,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF3FFB80>
319,Technical issue. Escalating.,"I work remotely as a senior help desk tech for a huge medical company that's world-wide. I'm more-or-less, tier 3 support. I'm the guy they call when the on-site systems analyst can't figure it out. 

Today I received a ticket in my queue that was escalated twice. It stated that the user cannot launch an application, with error message attached. I decided to take a look since I was just waiting for some Synology backups to finish anyway. 

The ticket comes with a message from the end user that reads, ""I cannot connect to $applicaiton that requires Internet Explorer. When I'm accessing it with Internet Explorer, I am getting the message below."". Hey, at least the end user knows that this particular applications does, in fact, require IE to function.

The note from T1 help desk says ""Not sure what's going on. Escalating"" and the note from Tier 2 says, ""Technical issue. Escalating."" This is normal when you have an application-level issue that isn't fixed by a simple reinstall or something. But that ""message below"" read as follows:

*""In order to access this application, you must install the J2SE Plugin version 1.6.0\_27. To install this plugin, click here to download the oaj2se.exe executable. Once the download is complete, double-click the oaj2se.exe file to install the plugin. You will be prompted to restart your browser when the installation is complete.""*

I copied this text word for word and sent it back back to tier 2 with the URL included.   
About 30 minutes later I get a message, ""That worked. Thanks.""

Yeah, if only there was some indication of what to do in this particular situation, right? I found out a little bit after this that the end-user has an A+ certification.",174,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF3FFBE0>
320,Customer complaint about Network Speed,"I work from a MSP and just a few days ago the big-shot director (BSD) of one of the companies we look after calls in with a complaint about the speed of the network in the office. So after a short conversation I discover BSD is undertaking the most fucky method of working I've ever come across in my few years in tech support.

A bit of background:

* BSD has a PC in the office
* Due to Covid Guidance/Rules BSD has been working from home for the best part of two years
* As they've been working from home BSD usually connects to their company using a VPN, then using RDP to connect to their PC at work and works off that

So these days BSD comes into the office a bit more, every couple of days perhaps. As BSD's been out of the office for quite a while staff within the office have requisitioned BSD's monitor for other uses, so BSD literally just has a tower PC.

This is where we come to the fuckiness:

1. When coming into the office BSD connects to OUR (we're in the same building as BSD's company) guest WiFi network with theirMacbook
2. They then connect via VPN to their own office Network (this is the office BSD is sat in, which not only has a guest WiFi network but their own dedicated company WiFi)
3. Now they're connected to the VPN via our network, they RDP to their tower PC which sits underneath the desk BSD has their Macbook sat on

We only find out about this BS because BSD complains that while working in the office the connection is really bad. NO SHIT",43,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF3FFC40>
321,Farah Alex Ivan Laura (FAIL) - just another password reset nightmare,"Edit: for everyone yelling about the NATO phonetics, I'll remind you of two things:
1. This call centre caters to consumers. The super non-technically inclined. Your grandma. That weird co-worker who can't make the number 1 on the keyboard into an exclamation point. They are even more confused by the NATO phonetics than without. 
2. This service is not in English, where the NATO phonetics make even less sense. 



Greetings fellow tech support gremlins!
So this happened today not to me but my co-worker, it was your run-of-the-mill lost Mac user password issue that got called in by an average Joe user.



Our tech support is phone calls only - no chats no emails and definitely no one coming in to help you in person. This is relevant because, as anyone who has given customer service through the phone knows, first off - you can't see what the person calling is doing. Secondly, it can be difficult to tell through the phone if a customer said a letter S or F, T or P, etc.



To combat this, when something needs to be spelled out exactly, we use designations instead of letters to spell out say, serials, order numbers, command line commands, and so on. So instead of ""W"", you say ""whiskey"" or any word starting with W so you and the customer knows which letter they need to spell. This is especially necessary if you're supporting a customer with poor language skills in the language the support is in.



So example@eg.com on the phone would be said out loud as 


Evan Xavier Adam Matt Perry Laura Evan at Evan Gabriel dot com



Now that we know all this - an elder gentleman calls in and explains that they have forgotten their Mac user password. When the usual routes to reset it fail, with MacOS you can help guide the customer into recovery mode and open up Terminal. If you input the command ""resetpassword"" into Terminal and press Enter, you'll be able to reset your Mac user password from there.



So my colleague had verbally, without seeing what's happening, guided this old man into recovery mode, gotten Terminal open, and guided customer to write ""resetpassword"" into Terminal.


English was not this customer's language. No biggie! My buddy spelled out the letters for the customer, as you do on the phone. It was as follows:



Roger Evan Sam Evan Tim Perry Adam Sam Sam William (with a ""double u"") Odie Roger David --> so, resetpassword with all lower case letters and typed together. *('with a w' because ""w"" is not a common letter in our language.)*



The typing took the customer exceptionally long. He's old - it happens. Finally he was done, and hit Enter. 


The reset did not work. Nothing happened. My colleague was scratching his head - he asked what and how did he type the command into Terminal from the customer. After some back and forth and struggle, it finally clicked. The old man had written, literally



rogerevansamevantimperryadamsamsamwilliamwithadoubleuodierogerdavid



My buddy needed a longer smoke break after that one.",48,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF3FFCA0>
322,I can't connect to the Printer!,"I work for a company that provides Managed Print Services.

Let me preface this with I am actually not one of our printer techs, but I am the first person most people talk to when they call in for tech issues. I do my best to resolve some of the simpler issues to leave the more difficult ones to the experts.

Setting up new computers to print is one I try handle for them. 

One of our customers is a local Community House. Covid has wreaked havoc on them and we have had to relocate their device to various premised at times, each time needing to configure it to a new wireless network.  They are lovely people, and there is one lady I deal with a lot, Betty (not real name). Normally she is pretty switched on. This day was not one of those days.

&#x200B;

\*\*phone rings on my direct line, not the main office line\*\*

I sort of recognised the number

me: Hello, and welcome to \[MPS company\], this is cheebung, how may I help you.

Betty: Oh hello cheebung, glad I caught you. I just got a new laptop, and I cant get it connected to the Printer.

Me: No worries, Betty. How about I remote in and see what we can do?

Betty: I was hoping you would say that.

we initiate a TeamViewer session and I go to the manufacturers website and download the correct print driver. Run the installer.

Hmmmm. cant find the printer.

Check the IP address of the printer from our records, and compare to last call as it may have changed. Try to manually connect via IP, no good, try ping the IP, no good.

Me: is the printer switched on Betty?

Betty: Yes. it's always on.

Now, when we installed this printer, we used an aftermarket WiFi extender to give the device connectivity as it was a third of the price of the OEM one. We have had problems where the extender loses connectivity to the main router. normally a reboot fixes this. (note: we stopped buying these for this very reason and buy the OEM ones now)

Me: Betty, on the back of our device is a little Wifi Box, I need you to switch it off and back on. It looks like the connection has dropped.

Betty: Really? it worked this morning on the old computer.

Me: It normally does the trick.

Betty: Okay, I'll have to drive back there then.

I stop in my tracks.

Me: Ummmmmm, where are you?

Betty: Home.

Me: Well there's your problem! you need to be AT the Community House to print.

I just assumed she was onsite at the time. Didnt even think to ask any different. (Assumption is the mother of all fuck-ups)

Betty: But it's wireless, and my new laptop is wireless. Shouldnt it work?

Me: No, it will only work when both the printer and laptop are on the SAME network.

I could almost hear the gears churning in her mind.

Me: How about you give me a call when you are next onsite.

Betty calls me 30 mins later and guess what, she could print! She apologises for her brain fade, and says she wont bother me again unless she is really sure she has an issue. 

I re-assure her that she can call me any time, and I'll try help her as much as I can.",22,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF3FFD00>
323,"""I need you to connect me to Google Chrome""","Hello once again all,

Today I have for you another story of true stupidity, that I still think back to and wonder ""this guy had to be messing with me.""

The characters of the story are as follows;

* Me: The hero of this anime and palmer of face.
* User: Probably voted most likely to forget to breathe in high school.

This story happens well into my shift, and on this day the call volume was very light which was to be expected with the holiday, at the time, coming up. While I was relaxing, the phone happens to ring. I go though my usual script, get his employee ID and ask him what the problem is. Thing is, I don't think I was ready for the conversation that would ensue.

Now before I go into the details of the call I want to preface with the fact that an update came out company wide that changed the home page for all devices. You'll learn why that's important later.

Anyway on with the call;

&#x200B;

>User: So I need you to connect me to Microsoft Internet Explorer or Google Chrome.  
>  
>Me: \**confused*\* I'm sorry what?  
>  
>User: So I need you to connect me to Microsoft Internet Explorer or Google Chrome.  
>  
>Me: Alright, I'm going to need to remote into your computer I'm not following here.

I get the necessary information to remote into his computer and have him show me the issue. He then proceeds to open Google Chrome.

&#x200B;

>User: See this is what I'm talking about it's not opening Google Chrome at all.

He's talking about the web page that I mentioned got changed earlier.

&#x200B;

>Me: Sir this is Google Chrome, I'm not sure what you're talking about.  
>  
>User: It used to open to Google Chrome not his.

I finally understand what the users issue is.

&#x200B;

>Me: Yes sir, so the homepage changed after an update pushed out by IT. You're in Google Chrome now. If you want to go to a site you would just type the site in using the bar at the top.

The user takes a minute to process what I told him. But the next thing out of his mouth is what had me questioning the call.

&#x200B;

>User: So I can type a URL into the address bar to go any site that I need to?  
>  
>Me: \**confused*\* yes.  
>  
>User: Alright thanks for your help!

&#x200B;

He then disconnects the call leaving me in a state of confusion. I still think it was a user who was bored and decided to mess with the help desk but I'll never know.

I hope you all enjoy the story.",227,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF3FFD60>
324,You have to turn it on...,"Long time reader of all these brilliant tales and thought I'd throw mine in the mix

I work for a software company which deals with a large suite of products for office work, sometimes external consultants are hired by our customers to help set things up, it happens all the time and on the whole they're very knowledgeable and great to work with.

The scene:

I receive a ticket in my queue that an automatically generated email that is triggered when a user performs action x is not working - FIX THIS ISSUE NOW!

After logging in and poking around I see nothing wrong with the set up of this email trigger except it's not turned on... it couldn't be so simple I thought. 

I decide this consultant must have turned it off so no emails are sent to annoy him if it does work or he is making changes and disabled it while doing so, it's a test system after all.

The call:

So I make the call. The guy answers and is instantly cold, tells me the product is garbage and it doesn't work. I'm polite and just wanted to call to ask if I can enable the feature and check it out. He tells me I can do whatever I want but he wants a developer to be on the call as it is broken! I enable it, perform action x, annnnnd it works...

He demands to know who had turned it off, demands this and that, finishing with a ""You're shit at your job and add the 'solution' to your ticket""

After the call I checked the logs and he disabled it (logs are a bit annoying to get so I did after the call)

The outcome:

Our team is pretty small and we have the customers who are regular ticket senders, and this guy was one of them but was my first time dealing with. So I let my manager know and she says no worries. The consultant gave me some terrible feedback and my manager deemed it necessary to call them. I wish I got to hear that call but she summed it up with ""I told him sometimes it's hard to admit that it's as simple as turning it on and maybe he should review his work before sending another ticket"" and apparently this wasn't appreciated and hung up.

I also recorded that call... and my manager has it saved for his next flare up.

Edit: spelt flare as flair",24,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF3FFDC0>
325,Network Printers Need to be Plugged into the Network to Print,"Alternate Title: Stop hitting s#!t with forklifts

I work in IT at a vaguely Med/Pharma related company. We have an IT department of 4. Currently, I'm the only one on-site while the other 3 are WFH because of the rona. We have 2 buildings with full warehouses/production areas. Most of the office staff (including me) are located at the one main building.

My first week, we got a request from someone who [decided to save my number](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/s126yz/dont_call_my_personal_number_on_vacation/) that she didn't think one of the printers was working. Of course, said printer is in the other building. It was nice out so I didn't mind walking the half mile over there. When I found the printer, the ethernet was unplugged from the back of it. I plugged it back in and verified with our SeniorIT guy that the IP was right and everything was working. Gucci.

A month later, a different user, FiredWareHouseGuy (He has another story later, between this story and his firing) sent in a ticket that the same printer wasn't working. I head over. This time it wasn't just unplugged, the RJ45 connector was totally destroyed. Guess who didn't plan ahead and came without any spare cables. I head back to the IT office and grab a replacement cable, go back to the printer. Huh. Weird. The printer itself actually doesn't allow for the clip to do anything. That might explain why it was unplugged the first time, and how it could've gotten broken this time. I tried both ends of the cable in both the wall and the printer to confirm this. The clips click into the wall, do nothing on the printer. What a stupid design.

A couple weeks later, FWHG puts in another ticket that it had been working before but wasn't now. At this point I'm irked and I tell SeniorIT that it was unplugged the last 2 times. He laughs and responds to FWHG's ticket to make sure it's plugged in. Crickets for a full day. Next day SeniorIT apologizes to me and asks if I can go over and check that it's plugged in. I go. It wasn't. I plugged it back in.

Not long later, another ticket from FWHG. Printer's not working. I'm ready to strangle someone. I head over there, veins full of fury, and find that the entire desk (desktop, monitor, printer) has been moved about 30 feet over to the next column in the warehouse. They plugged everything into the ethernet ports that had been installed by our network contractor. Those guys punched it into the patch panel but left it one step short of actually plugging it into the switch in the same IDF cabinet. Naturally. So I grab the scissor lift, (our IDFs are at the ceiling) patch the port, verify connectivity, and tell SeniorIT all this. He responds with something vague about ""problems with forklifts"" so I check FWHG's ticket history.

5 months before I started, a ticket request for installation of those new network ports. Boss (only one who can approve expenditures) answers asking why they need it since the network contractors we use kind of suck and it's expensive to run unnecessary cables. FWHG answers ""It's become a safety issue with the desk in its current location. EHS Manager said it needs to be moved.""

I asked around and got the gossip. The forklift operators kept running into the desk, knocking the ethernet loose from the back of the printer. Eventually, someone hit a person who was using the computer, at which point it was finally decided that moving the desk was a good idea. A lower level supervisor had quit recently because he hated his boss, FWHG. We think he was the one who would plug the printer back in when he needed to use it.",52,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF3FFE20>
326,How to get customers fired easily (only by getting insulted by angry clients),"Another story from my techSupport Job in Retail. Not really proud of this but I think it might help People with similar issues.

It is less the Issue itself than the way people spoke to me.

This is the Cast:

HentaiSenpai230797 as Me

CW - CustomersWife - The Wife of the Store Manager

C - Customer - Manager of the Store

Dave - My Colleague (Name Changed to keep him anonymous)

SV - Our Supervisor (I don't like him)

TSV - Technician Supervisor (The coolest guy in the company I ever met)

  
This was on a Friday evening before Christmas eve 2020.

  
Was in a late-shift with Dave in Homeoffice when my phone rang.

Me: ""Welcome to TS, this is HentaiSenpai speaking.""

CW: ""Good evening Sir, I am calling from <a city far away>. There is a serious Error on my Electronic Cash Terminal. Temper Error.""

This means the Device is DEAD

Me: ""I am very sorry M'am, the mentioned device is broken and needs replace. I will open a Ticket and send a technician to you to replace this.""

CW: ""When will the Tech come?""

Me: ""Well, they only work in very urgent cases on Saturday. Since you have 10 more Check-Outs with E-Cash Devices I don't think this is that urgent? So I think on Monday.""

CW: ""Yeah, I think this is okay.""

  


She hangs up, I send the request to our Technicians

""Please replace E-Cash Terminal TYPE 1337 on POS 3 For store YYXXXX""

  


20 Minutes later the phone rang again. It was Dave: ""Someone wants to speak to you."" The forwarded the Call. A very upset and dark voice literally shouted at me.

C: ""How are you talking to my wife you son of a B\*\*\*\*?!""

Me: ""I don't understand? Whats the matter?"" \*Double Checking if the Call-Recorder is recording which was accepted by the customer before\*

C: ""Remembering the broken E-Cash Terminal? That was my wife! Why didn't you solved the issue?""

Me: ""How? I am living on the other side of the country and the device has to be replaced as I explained to your wife.""

C: ""And why can this be replaced not before Monday?""

Me: \*Knowing this will lead into trouble\* ""Because our Techs are only available for very urgent cases on Saturdays. This is not this urgent your wife told me."" 

In the Background you can hear her agreeing to me!

C:""This is BS! I cannot use this POS! I only have 10 working Checkouts!""

Me: ""You've got 9 more working Check-Outs than our store from your company. And we have Saturday before Christmas, too""

C:""I Expect you to contact a responsible Person for your Technicians! I want my new Terminal Tomorrow at 8AM!""  


&#x200B;

Customer hang up. Poor CW, has to deal with a very aggressive Husband.

I had a cigarette to calm down. During this I called TSV who fortunately took a longer Shift.

I told him about the Store and the call. He was laughing. ""I can offer him to send someone on Monday, 6AM.""

TSV also informed SV via Teams. (I don't like SV, but I already had to provide him this call since the customer is raging!)

Short after that we have been in a Teams Meeting. TSV, SV, Dave and me. I was calling the Customer.

  


C:""FINALLY! When is my Tech coming tomorrow?""

Me:""Monday 6AM, and this is not the normal service time for them."" 

C:""You litte piece of S\*\*\*. WHEN I SAY TOMORROW THEN I MEAN TOMORROW! I want to talk to your Manager!""

Customer started insulting me (Words I don't know the english word and even if I did, I don't want to mention them here), the Teams-Call was hearing him clearly. CW tried to calm hin down. I am sure I heard him slapping her face, shouting ""Shut up, I did not talk to you."" CW left the room crying silently.

SV was shaking his head.

Me: in a serious Voice ""Sir, kindly ask you to stop insulting me and slapping you wife! My Supervisor and the Technicians Supervisor are hearing you.""

C:""They should. Hope the terminate you for talking BS.""

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Meanwhile in Teams-Chat:

Dave: ""How should we handle this customer""

SV:""HentaiSenpai, end this call. He should get in touch with his Headquarter. If something's wrong I'll take the responsibility forthis. His Number was temporarily blocked in our Phone-Server""

TSV:""For this I make hin wait for after Christmas"" (Note: In Germany Christmas is only 2 Days after Christmas Eve.)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Me: ""I'm gonna end this call now. If you have any problems please get in touch with your headquarters""

C:""You Son of a female Dog! I make you company fire you!""

Me: \*Hangs up\*

&#x200B;

In the meantime I chain-smoked half my box of cigarettes. Dave and SV told me to take a break, and log-off the Call Dispatch System. It was less than an hour until the nightshift starts.

&#x200B;

Funfact:

In the Meantime the EC-Terminal for the only POS in our store stopped working. Since this is normally not my job I was asked to Set it up so we don't have to send a technician my 200 Soul village. The store had an Terminal in spare but was about 300 kilometers from our HQ away. I fixed it the next day, thinking about a head smoking guy complaining about ""only"" 10 working CheckOuts. I was smiling a bit.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Got an E-Mail on next working day. CW was apologizing for her husbands behavior. I feel so sorry for her. She told me about divorcing from his very aggressive Husband. WOW! 

TSV really shifted the replacement to the 27th December! SV sent the Call-Recordings and a 3 Page long complaint to the Customers HQ.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Got a call the same day from the Customers Headquarter. Apologizing for the behavior of C. The asked for my Address to send an apologize-Gift (100 Euro Gift-card and a 1 Year Premium Membership for their online Store).

&#x200B;

After Christmas C called one last time. He demanded to another colleague to be connected with me. One last time he apologized and said good-bye. He was fired by his HQ.

“Uhm, sir. We do state this on our website, if you check the following information…” 

“I read lots about your product before buying it, it did not say so when I bought it.” 

“Sir, our shop and information page explain this.”

“No it does not.” 

“May I ask where you purchased our Product?” 

“Oh I purchased it on some weird website….. Oh…” 



So yeah at least he realized his mistake and decided to contact his seller.",48,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF3FFEE0>
328,Asking about unable to remote in to work laptop,"Just a little background of me. I am a BPO\_IT ServiceDesk of a voice account and this story happened way before the pandemic hit the world. For remote desktop we and the users are using the standard RDA in windows computer.

A user called in cause she was unable to remote in to work desktop in the office causing an error. So I properly probed the user on what is happening and the error she is getting.

She has a company laptop that she is using for months now and suddenly the laptop was not able to connect to the internet, wifi network is connected but saying no internet connection and from her location there is no lan cable available for wired connection.

I was dumbstruck to finally realize what she was really trying to do here. So what she tried is she logged in to another office computer with proper connection and to remote in to her office laptop, which was currently offline, because it was offline. Since the laptop was offline was getting the error when trying to remote in to the laptop.

so I calmy explained to the caller that for the RDA to work both computer needs to be online and in our case also  to be connected to the company vpn. Don't know if she understood my explanation or just verbally nodded. So I assisted her through the phone in troubleshooting her laptop. In the end I created a ticket to their company local IT to reinstall the ethernet drivers.",3,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF3FFF40>
329,Just move the elevator somewhere more convenient,"Network cabling technician for an investment bank.

Early shift. Get a ticket handover from late shift, came from Network Operations: ""There's a switch with hostname X that's offline. Kindly verify power with visual check.""

Search the hostname in the database of network equipment in all the datacenters and IDFs, can't find the thing. Well that's odd.

Late shift guy calls in, ""I'm gonna be late; hungover. But if NetOps calls, the elevator is down.""

""The what?""

""The elevator. You know that ticket about the downed switch? It's a smart elevator, but the elevator is down.""

""So where is the switch?""

""On top of the elevator.""

""Ah, okay."" Don't wanna know how he found that out. Kick the ticket back to Network Operations. Elevator is offline and undergoing maintenance. Switch is in elevator, ergo switch is also offline.

Ticket is kicked back. Network Operations: ""Can you turn it back on?""

""To gain access to the switch I'd have to have an Otis technician move the elevator, and if they could do that, I wouldn't need to gain access to the switch.""

""Well, when can we expect the switch back on?""

""When Otis fixes the elevator, I'd imagine.""

""I don't understand. Switches are supposed to be powered separately on standard rack PDUs. This is inconvenient.""

I send pictures of an electrician and three elevator repairmen in an open elevator shaft, and a picture of the switch in question in a small metal box affixed to the top of the elevator. ""Where do you think we could put a standard rack PDU?""

""Well can you move it to someplace more standard, with the rest of the switches?""

""Can I move this switch that controls the elevator... away from the elevator?""

""Oh."" Network Operations then contacts Network Deployment. ""Is there any way we can turn this switch back on?""

I turn to the late shift guy, as this game of email tag has gone on all day. ""Now it's my turn to drink.""",263,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF3FFFA0>
330,Rogue Programmer,"Identifiers obscured to protect my own personal sitter-downer, thank you very much.

This was a few years into my time at a major medical research institution where I had the ""care and feeding"" of a custom built, mission-critical application in Lotus Notes (LN).  The app shepherded content and workflow for research plans from initial authoring, through approval, to termination.  Interestingly, I worked for the department that oversees/administers the research processes, rather than the IT department, because when the ResAdmin folks identified a need for it (in the interest of not producing approximately three tons of paperwork annually), the IT folks wanted nothing to do with the thing.  So, the ResAdmin folks contracted it out, then managed it internally.  All of that put me in an ... interesting position:  a single developer, working on a major system, both it and me out of direct IT oversight.  (There were two other apps, with attendant developers, in the same exact circumstances for the same exact reasons, but that's not this story.) 

Due to size limitations of DBs in the r5 (1999) version of LN we used, the app was comprised of a couple-few LN databases working together on servers which were in mirror replicated A/B clusters.  A was the main user-accessed one, and B caught the ball if A dropped it, with backups running from B, almost entirely eliminating user impact.  It worked pretty well.  By this time, I had a pretty good ""non-sysadmin"" grasp of how things worked on the server side, which turned out to be a handy when one morning it came to my attention that everything on the B side of one my DBs was simply gone.

This quickly became A Thing.

My initial report to my management and the LN Admin folks (who were great folks, but still unsure of me at this point) ignited a massive firestorm of calls, emails, updates, meetings, research, poking things with sticks, waving dead chickens over various pieces of equipment, wailing, and gnashing of teeth.  It wasn't a full catastrophe, because production was unaffected, we just had no redundancy or data backup on a very high-volume system.  More akin to noticing that the tide has suddenly gone *waaaaaay* out:  you're fine for the moment on the beach, but disaster is like, *totally* impending.

This circumstance continued several days before IT called a meeting of me, my supervisor, my second level report, my third level report, and several levels of the LN Admin folks (most of whom I never saw before or after).  The LN Admin folks were reporting what they'd been able to figure out so far, and trying to work out what to do next because they were stumped.  I later learned they were kinda drifting toward blaming the whole mess on the ""Rogue Programmer"" in ResAdmin (i.e., me), presumably the only reason I was even there. They were displaying various pieces of the application, DBs, servers etc. and eventually reached the settings that controlled replication between servers.  These settings determine what gets replicated when and where, to support things like carrying a small subset of data on a laptop when disconnected from the network (circa 2003-ish).  One setting defined how old a document could be and still be replicated.

I asked the question: ""Why is there an asterisk in the 'replicate after' field?""

That field, oddly enough, expects to have a date in it or nothing at all.  It should be blank in our case, because Regulations (the Federal kind) required keeping everything forever.  It turns out that for LN '\*' \~ 'next Thursday', so it dutifully did not replicate anything older than that, and diligently removed all such from the replication target DB – just as it was designed to do.

The best part?  Rogue Programmers have zero access to edit these particular settings; such access being reserved to the experts over in IT.

This was neither the first nor last time I had to figure out issues that I couldn't reach (or indeed see), and explain to the 'experts' in IT how to fix things, but it *was* the only time it happened with the actual LN Admin folks.  As I said, great folks, for the most part.

It was also the only time I heard of them describing me as a Rogue Programmer, though it was enjoyably common in ResAdmin for quite a while.

331,The One With The Script Reader and The Witch,"This tale takes place many moons ago, during my college years. I was not *official* tech support (at that time, at least) but rather, de facto tech support, by the merit of being the only student in my circle who genuinely understood those new fangled computer thingies. (I'd been that person ever since grade school, for reference.)

Cast:

Me: yours truly

Teacher: an interesting woman who fancies herself an honest-to-god witch

Old Guy: (ahem) ""real"" tech support

One of my teachers was unusually charismatic. She somehow managed to collect up a circle of students around her who would happily flock to her home when they were not taking actual classes, for various events ranging from off-the-books educational experiences with guest lecturers to topless pool parties. And no: the school neither knew about nor approved of these latter activities. So okay… maybe ""charismatic"" doesn't come close to adequately describing her. In addition, she also liked to tell people that she was a witch with actual magic powers. This last detail is -- shockingly -- actually vaguely pertinent to the story.

I was one of the students within her circle of influence, so one day she asked me if I could come over to help her with a problem getting her dial-up internet working again. I asked her what was wrong, and she told me that she got mad at the computer, and zapped the modem. To illustrate for me, she did this whole, ""I'm a witch!"" thing with a very convincing dramady performance, with the hands out stretched and the fingers all pointed at the computer and the vaguely evil cackle -- which she did disturbingly well -- and the… well, you get the idea. I intentioned to never argue with her about her supposed ""powers"" but I did happily agree to see if I could find the problem.

I showed up, and it turned out that she used the single most popular dial-up provider in all of America -- at the time -- to help her get Online. (Yes... that one.) She then told me that she really just wanted me to talk to tech support for her, since she has no clue what they were talking about when they told her to do stuff. We made one attempt to dial-in (unsuccessfully, of course) so that I would know what was going on, and then we called up their support line, and I explained the problem to them.

This is where we met the Old Guy. He was on the other end of the line, and he seemed like a nice elderly gentleman. He listened to what we had to say and then there was a protracted pause as he slowly and methodically typed into his computer on the other end. It was pretty clear that he was typing, as I could hear the muffled keystrokes, so I waited patiently. Finally he came back to us, and in his very prominent southern accent, he started out with, ""Alright... Alright! Now, you just sit back and listen carefully, because I'm an *expert* in these matters, and I'll get you alllllllll fixed up before long. Now, step one...""

At which point, he started reading from his screen. That's right folks, our much ballyhooed ""expert"" was an early iteration of what all too many low-tier tech support technicians end up being coerced into, these days: He was a script reader with an internal database of questions and answers which he had simply queried. The steps he read from were ultra basic and clearly pretty universal, but I dutifully followed along. We navigated through various settings dialogs, and at some point we came to a particular setting where he said, ""Make sure that this is toggled on..."" and it wasn't. I read the setting and realized that this was almost guaranteed to be exactly what was causing Teacher’s issue, so I clicked the save button and quickly backed out of all the rest of the dialog box madness.

I then pulled up the login screen, preparing the software for dial-up, but not wanting to be disrespectful to the Old Guy, I waited patiently for him to finish the rest of his spiel and catch up with me. I then thanked him for his time and (ahem) expertise, and told him that we would call back if it didn’t work. (""OHHHH, it'll work, don’t you worry!"")

Needless to say, it worked just fine, and she was able to get back online.

TLDR: Witch casts curse on her computer modem. Computer wizard casts counter spell -- with a little bit of help from a wizened old script reader in tech support. Computer wizard rolls a natural 20, and wins the battle with nary a scratch. Witch cavorts in her backyard pool in celebration... which is *not* a pretty sight to see.",15,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF4400A0>
332,User ignores me and then gets upset when I say there's a scheduling problem.,"Got a ticket a few days ago. Super simple request. Hook up an old printer, and install some current printers in computers. The printer names were not given, and the users that need the printers installed are not given. No biggie. I'm used to having to gather info. Here's the email chain.

Hi *user*

Do you know the names of the printers that we want connected to these user’s PCs?

Thanks!

-me

She responded with... 



We want to add the following printers to (computer name 1) and (computer name 2):

 

(printer name 1) and (printer name 2)

 

We also have an extra printer in the back lab we would like to get set up to those same computers.

*user*


So far so good. I know the printers we need and the computers that need them. However, she didn't give me any contact info for the users. I figure the best way to fix this would be to just email clickable links so she can forward it to anyone who needs the printer installed. My reply was... 

Okay, so for the first two 

(clickable link for printer 1)

If you forward this email to the users on those computers, they can simply click the link above and it will install the printer automatically.

For some reason the naming for the (printer 2) is weird and might actually be called (printer 2 actual name), so we may need to try this link. 

(Pritner 2 clickable link) 

As for the extra printer in the back, I’m guessing it’s not set up as a networked printer?

Thanks!

-me


Now here's where it starts to fall apart. She ignores the entire section about the clickable links and focuses on the old printer. Her reply was... 


The one in the back is not set up.  The (location) one is specifically for the label printer.


So she just says it's not set up. Cool. We have a somewhat short back and forth about it.

Me: Is it a brand new printer? Does anyone currently use it?

Her: It is not new but we want to use it.  It’s not currently set up.

Me: Was it purchased through IT? Can you maybe send me a picture of it?

Her: It’s an old printer (serial number)

Me: Hmmm I can’t find any info for that serial in our asset database, but I still may be able to set it up. Where specifically are you? Are you at the (main office)?

Her: Yes we are in (main office) . (directions for her part of the office).

Me: I’ll drop by shortly after lunch if that’s okay.

Her: That should work


So after lunch I stop by her area and she isn't there. One of the other employees show me the old printer. It's a 10+ year old printer that was decommissioned years ago. Just for kicks I see if there's a compatible network jack nearby and there isn't. I go back to my desk, check some documentation, and learn that we actually can't re-add this printer to our print server. Or rather, in order to add it, we would need an approval from our comitte. (it's complicated, don't worry too much about it, we have a printing committee to minimize paper waste and environmental impact) so, I send her this email (that she doesn't see until the next day.


Hey *user*, do you guys have a regular printer down there? We actually can’t hook up this old printer is there is a regular printer down there unless we get approval from the print smart committee.


She proceeds to not reply for a couple days, so I send this.


Hi *user*, 

Any updates on this?

-me


So after two more days she replies with...

Don’t worry about hooking up the old printer.  The ones back lab computers are not working with the (printer name) though.

 
*user*


I thought by now we had resolved the installation problems. I sent her clickable links. So now I'm thinking that there's a more complicated problem. I follow up with...

Are they even installed on those computers? If they are, what happens when trying to print to them?

No response. A week passes. I'm getting a little frustrated that my several weeks old ticket for a super simple problem is still open, so I fuck up and send her this

Scheduling seems to be a problem to getting this ticket resolved. Let’s take care of it with clickable links via email. You can forward this email to anyone that needs the printer installed. If that doesn’t work, have the user call me (my phone number) and I’ll assist in installing manually. Thank you!

 

(clickable link for printer 1)

(clickable link for printer 2)


Well let's just say I shouldn't have done that. 10 years in IT doesn't prepare you for this I guess. She replied (within MINUTES) with this.

I don’t feel there was ever a scheduling issue.  If you wanted to set up a time to come down we could have accommodated that but you did not.  You stopped by one day after lunch and then sent a few emails (see below) with some questions.

 

*user*


I'm a little annoyed by this. Technically she's right, I only dropped by once, but she didn't provide enough information for me to even see what the problem is. I replied with...

Is it possible to have users click on the link I sent, or is that not going to work? If it isn’t, when would be a good time to come downstairs today to resolve?

I figured maybe she was the type of user who just really wants someone desk side. But, surprising nobody, she never replied to this email. I forwarded the entire email chain to my boss so she would be aware in case this user wanted to complain about me, boss said I did nothing wrong and the user will likely not try to contact us anymore. If she does, I'll just get the problem fixed.

Tldr, user wanted help but ignored specific questions and emails and then made it seem like I wasn't communicating enough.",104,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF440100>
333,I don't have time to fix my problems!,"*Hello everyone, first post, please, be nice.* :)

Working at international airport you meet a lot of different people, even more working for L1 IT support - from check-in personnel and plane engineers to highest management. And because COVID happened, so our nightmare - VPNs and home offices.

Got a call from a user - My VPN is not working, generic error code ""Cannot connect to VPN, connection failed"". It worked in morning, now (lunch time) it's not. She also claimed, it's not the first time. I do a general user check and I look into ticket history - nothing, but looking at Active Directory the login is locked. Strange but happens, even more during home office. Unlocked, she connected, everything seemed fine.

15 minutes later, same user, same problem but new information -  she couldn't access internal files so she restarted her computer and surprise surprise, it locked her out again. First I suspected network issues, but the picture got clearer... as her attitude got worse and worse.

*IT - played by me, AU - Angry User*  
AU: So tell me, how should I work now?  
IT: Work as normal, your profile is unlocked. Only other thing I can do is delete your saved passwords, which may cause this locking. I can remote to you and do it, but it will take some time and may force you to log in to certain places again, which can slow you down. If you are busy now, you can call us again when your shift is ending so...  
AU: I have no shift end, I work 24/7, I am a spokesperson and need the connection all the time! So I don't know when to ""let you know"".  
IT: Well, when you have your current work done or...  
AU: My work is never done, but okay...

  
At this point, I am trying to explain what is happening, why it's happening and what I can do - keep unlocking which is faster, or remote in and try to fix it.

AU: I don't have time to fix these technical issues and it keeps me away from work! I have a meeting in an hour, I'm home at home office with COVID positive kid and I need to make him lunch... so I don't know, I don't have four arms!

I am loosing patience, I take the initiative and decide to just fix it to get rid of her. She is passive aggressive and I am happy to get an IP from her. When I'm finally connected there, she now tells me, that even Outlook was asking for her login details. Damn... That would be helpful 20 minutes ago.

Control panel - Credential Manager - wipe all that looks suspicious - PC reset, done in under 3 minutes. When I'm done and just double checking, she does 180 and starts to act ""normal"". Well, you can't fool me.

Moral of my story? Tell all that's been happening that is not standard, act human to people that wants to help you and we will do the best we can to fix your issue. Thanks for reading.

334,Don't Call my Personal Number on Vacation,"I work in IT at a Company that is vaguely in the Med/Pharma Industry.  We're only a department of 4. I was originally hired to be temporary coverage for paternity leave but they offered me a full-time position they were adding. At that point, I got a company-issued cell phone. Prior to this, I'd used my personal number for the few times I'd needed to make a call. Unfortunately, one of those people was...

&#x200B;

Technical Trainer. She used to be a Warehouse Supervisor but rumor is they couldn't fire her so when the other position came up, they welcomed it to get her out of their department. My first week, she called (instead of using our ticket system) to complain to my coworker (LazyIT) that one of the printers didn't have a label tag on it with the name. Most of the other ones did, but occasionally they fall off. Also she isn't sure it's working. LazyIT sent me to go figure it out because he does nothing that requires him to leave his desk. I had to find it by pinging methodically (our printer naming convention is pretty straight-forward so I knew it had to be one of a few numbers) and matching the IP listed on the printer's screen. We have a label maker but had run out of the print-roll and were waiting on the next shipment of office supplies so I called Technical Trainer to give her the name and let her know I'd make a label as soon as I could. She thanked me and that was that, or so I thought. Little did I know, she'd saved my phone number. Ugh.

&#x200B;

Flash forward a few months, I was in the weird limbo of ""my contract was extended because the  position doesn't open until the new year for budget reasons. Because I'm a temp, I'm not allowed to be on the employee directory even though I now have a company phone number."" Rules are dumb but I don't care enough to argue. It's tied to my AD account so people can look it up in Outlook. I had already booked a vacation that was after the end date on my contract. When my boss extended it, he gave me the time off without question, even though I don't get PTO. I set my out of office message on Outlook/Teams with my dates off and said to contact LazyIT or SeniorIT. I left my laptop & company phone at home. I'm hourly so no expectation of work on personal time. In Colorado, I hiked Quandary Peak with my sister. She runs marathons. I don't. Thought I was going to die. Anyway, unsurprisingly, there was poor cell service at 14,000+ ft. When we got back to the cabin, I collapsed onto the floor and plugged my phone in to charge. I saw the notification that I had a voicemail. I clicked on it.

&#x200B;

""Hi, this is Technical Trainer, I-""

&#x200B;

Deleted without listening to the rest of it. When I got back in town, I checked and had no emails or IMs from her. Checked her ticket history and there were no new entries. She didn't call LazyIT or SeniorIT so it couldn't have been that important. I mentioned all this to my boss. His response: ""I would block her number if it were me.""

I was working for [insert generic Fortune 50 company here]. Our help desk team fielded thousands of tickets a day that run the gamut of banality, including my very own time I accidentally got pear in my keyboard. But this day was different: a senior employee contacted the help desk team via the phone number to let them know his laptop was stolen from his hotel room on a business trip. He had a police report case number for reference and needed the help desk team to send him a new laptop. Pretty standard, the help desk gets at least one stolen laptop notification a week, though usually it’s a contractor stealing it from someone’s cube or a car break in, and the help desk has protocols to handle this. The first question they asked of course was whether he knew who stole it. His answer? (To keep this safe for work) a woman he’d paid for company. This obviously meant it had to be escalated to HR and then to me, and ultimately resulted in immediate termination. The lesson from this? If someone you’ve paid for overnight company steals your laptop in retaliation because you’ve protested her going rate and refused to pay, don’t tell your HR department.

337,Universal human trait,"About a week ago, my sister called me with an offer: ""I bought a macbook from my roommate's friend the other day, can you come help me set it up? I'll buy you dinner.""

Now I honestly don't have a whole lot of experience with macs, I've never owned one and only do basic troubleshooting for our mac users at work, but I hadn't seen this sister in a while due to covid and I'm also not one to turn down free food, so that evening after work I head over to her place. I get there and we chat for a bit, complain about our parents, the usual. Then she shows me her score: A 2017 MacBook Pro that she got from this guy for well under MSRP because ""he doesn't know anything about computers. I mean neither do I, but still."" It's a definite upgrade from her ancient MacBook Air that she somehow has been using for photo editing despite it's reluctance to do basically anything. I'm thinking that this'll be a quick and easy profile setup and Lightroom download, so I crack open her new toy and things get... interesting.

First problem: This macbook was sitting at about 12% battery and my sister was not given the charger, because the guy apparently lost it. Cool. I fish a USB-C cable out of my bag and plug it into an old iphone charging brick. This isn't able to charge the battery while the screen is on, but at least it buys me a little more time. Second problem: the macbook still has this guy's profile on it and it has a password that he didn't provide. The password hint was simply and succinctly:

*Universal human trait*

As the battery lowers to 11%, I have my sister call the guy to get the password, but he doesn't answer.

 ""Ok,"" I ask, ""what would this dude say is a universal human trait?""

""Well he wears crystals and is big into energy healing and chakras and shit, and also he fucks anything that moves""

...cool. I try the basics: *love*, *empathy*, *curiosity*, *companionship*, and many many more, all to no end. Maybe he's a pessimist? I try *fear*, *selfishness*, the seven deadly sins, nothing is working. All the while my sister is still unable to reach him. Maybe it's something more neutral? *Hunger*, *sleep*, *horny*, *uwu*. My last attempt is *shit*.

Nothing

I'm a bit bummed at this point. I'd had a pretty stressful ~~day~~ ~~week~~ ~~life~~ past little while and was really hoping for the simple solution with this. But, I'm the family IT girl for a reason, so as the battery drops to 10%, I head into the macOS recovery system. I see that the hard drive has about 8GB of free space anyway so I say fuck it, reformat the thing and reinstall the OS. The battery survives the reformat and I go to reinstall the OS, where it gives me the options of High Sierra and that's it. We make it to the setup page and I have my sister set up her profile. All seems to be going well save for the battery life, so we first move to download Lightroom. Only to be told that we need Catalina or later.

""Ok that should be easy"", I say.

I grab the installer for Catalina and run it. It chugs along for several minutes until slapping us in the face with ""Failed to verify or restore storage system (-69716)"". And then, the battery dies.

Frustrated and hungry, we decide to just let it ""charge"" as much as possible while we go to dinner.

On our way out the door, the guy she bought the macbook from texts her

""Hey sorry i was asleep. The password is *poop* lmao""

.

The next day we reconvened for a ""remote"" session, where through the power of text message I walked my sister through the disk repair utility, and eventually we got Catalina and Lightroom installed. She tells me that the next time she sees the guy she got this macbook from, she'll try not to kill him.",23,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF4402E0>

339,Did you try turning it on?,"Long-time lurker, first time caller here on the sub. This story isn’t about IT, but I think laser machines do count as technology. 

Between semesters at university, I worked in the machining and metal fabrication business. This story takes place when I was a laser machine operator. 

One summer, I was to teach a few people how to run the machine over a period of about 2 months, before I had to go back to uni. Most of them didn’t make the grade, but the star of our story, Blank, was something else. Not a bad guy, but just completely uninterested in what I was trying to teach. 

The reason I call him Blank is because when you tried to teach him something, he would stare at you blankly. And if you asked him a question, he would either say he “blanked” on the answer, or he wouldn’t even understand the question.

For example, to turn on the laser machine, you need to turn on the power regulator. There are 2 switches on the box; the first one is the ON/OFF switch which we need to turn to the ON position. The second is a switch to change the regulator from 3-phase output to single phase output. This second switch we do not touch, and there is a very clear warning to never change this switch. 

I have walked Blank and a few others through this process for a couple of days, so each day I get one of them to do the full process by themselves. 

Take a wild guess at which one Blank used to turn on the machine. 

If you guessed the single-phase/3-phase switch, you are a winner! 

---

The tale I want to specifically tell is one of the few times I made him operate the laser machine without any help from myself or any others I was teaching. Normally they would collaborate to set up the machine correctly, but I just wanted to test Blank’s abilities as he was clearly the worst of the group. 

At this stage, he was able to do the basics of turning on the machine and setting up a job to be cut. So the next step was for him to actually cut a job by himself.

I stand back and ask him to do everything. After a while, I finally hear the machine turn on, but I can’t hear any cutting. 

After about half an hour off faffing about, Blank finally comes to me and asks for help. I am about to ask him to walk me through his process when I see something obviously wrong.

Normally, there is a little red LED light the comes out of the laser head. This shows exactly where the laser is in relation to the sheet we are cutting. 

Using this LED, we do a process called framing. The laser will move over the sheet metal in a rectangular shape showing the maximum dimensions of the parts we are cutting.

This light is missing.

So clearly, Blank hasn’t even framed the job properly, if this light is missing at this stage of the process. So already I’m a bit nervous. 

Blank tells me he tried to cut the job, but no beam came out, which explains why there are no marks on the material I asked him to cut.

I ask him to turn on the LED light, but when he presses the button, it fails to illuminate. 

At this point I can clearly see why nothing happened, but I am trying to make this teaching lesson, so I ask him to see why the LED didn’t turn on. 

Blank still has no idea.

For his part, all he knows is that he set up the job, tried to cut it, but it didn’t cut. And the LED is off for some reason. 

Next to the LED button, there is a second button that we need to press called “Shutter”. Both buttons light up when active but are off by default.

You cannot turn on the LED without opening the Shutter. 

You cannot cut without opening the Shutter

And the Shutter button is off. 

No matter how hard I try and guide Blank to the correct solution, he always misses this critical point. 

A closed shutter means no LED and no cutting, but he just cannot see the issue at all.

Finally, I just give up and show him the Shutter button which is clearly off.

I know I can’t teach Blank anymore for the day, and just do the job myself. 

Fortunately for my sanity, Blank didn’t stick around at our company for too much longer after this.

As the summer drew to a close, I was able to train up one guy to operate the machine full time, and a second guy who would be working part time.

Blank left for greener pastures, with some modicum of success. So good for him, I guess.",12,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF4403A0>
340,I'm the 33rd technician here? No pressure then.,"Once again I've enjoyed a few beers and whilst perusing Reddit and reading TFTS awesomeness I felt drawn to regale y'all with another tale from my past.

For a few years I worked for a large telecom company in the US who delivered IPTV, internet, and voice over their circuits.  It was my bridge from retail to the real IT work I do today, and while I detested climbing poles, attics, and crawling under houses, I rather enjoyed the work. I have the innate skill of ""following the wire"", as with any wired circuit with an issue, no matter what tools you have at your disposal the real work was chasing it down and knowing where to look and what to look for.  I wasn't the top technician by numbers but I WAS the guy managers would call out to deal with escalations.

This job was one of those. A guy who'd had our service for a few years once again had intermittent issues. My favorite.  Unless it went out of service (OOS) while I was there, there was very little I could do besides inspect and test every segment of the wire path I had access to.  I told my manager as much, he said to just do the best I could.  Fine, whatever, hopefully waving my magic wand works today.

I call ahead, do my usual remote tests, of course everything looks perfect right now. Drive down, knock on the door, introduce myself. Tell him my manager sent me out specifically to deal with this problem. The guy laughed. ""Let me show you how many of y'all have been sent here to do precisely that."" He opens a composition book and shows me a list of technician names, IDs, dates, and times.  ""You mind signing in?""

I honestly laughed in absurdity.  Shaking my head, I write my own name, ID, today's date, and the time on my watch.  When I'm done I count, and there were 32 other names above mine, dating back over the last four years. ""Sir, unless I'm mistaken, you've had issues with our service ever since you've had it installed. Why the hell are you still with us?""

""Well, I LOVE the service when it works, which is most of the time. I'll never go back to cable. When it doesn't it is annoying, of course. Something is wrong somewhere, and I figure if I keep calling enough eventually someone will figure it out and fix it.""

My company was never going to recoup the money they've spent trying to fix this customer's service, even if he was subscribed without another call for the next fifteen years.  Nevertheless, I liked a challenge, so I decided to do my thing.  

What I found was the most immaculate install I had ever seen. A shielded CAT-5E cable was bonded in the customer's network interface device (NID) and run to their modem. All of their TV receivers were connected with perfectly crimped shielded ethernet cable, as were their desktop PCs. They only had one telephone, a multi-handset cordless base, which was plugged directly into the modem, bypassing any house wiring (okay in this case as they had a wireless alarm system that didn't even require a landline phone connection, a new thing back in those days). A beautiful buried shielded drop wire running from their NID to the pedestal in the alley, properly bonded at both ends. The pedestal was also new, with shiny terminals and new splices to the underground cable. I tested everything anyway. It all came back perfect.

Well, shit.  

All I could do was wait for it to screw up. I texted my manager and asked how much time I could have, because it was a perfect install and there was absolutely nothing I could correct. He told me I had the rest of the day. It was 3pm, that meant I would be expected to stay until midnight, or until the customer told me to leave. I relayed this to the customer, he laughed and said ""You can sleep on the couch if you want if this means my shit gets fixed."" Shit.

Luckily for me, I only had to wait about three hours until their service showed a disruption. I snapped to run a loop test (basically a frequency domain reflective (FDR) type test) originating from our equipment.  I had run the same test before to determine the electrical length of their loop, also to look for bad connections along the way.  It was perfectly flat all the way to their house.  I ran it again, and found what showed up as a bridge tap roughly 400 feet away from their house.  BINGO. Intermittent located.  Downside was, it was in the cable in the ground somewhere, and per the union contract that meant No Touchy for me.  I called my manager.. no answer. It was after 6. Called the on duty manager. ""There aren't any cable techs working this late. You'd have to put in a ticket for tomorrow.""  Of course tomorrow it'll be fine, I won't be able to convince the tech to measure and locate what I captured, and the job will get closed out ""No trouble found"", which is a death sentence for us techs who dared to call them out in the first place.  Well fuck that, I'm going to find it myself.

I tell the customer what I learned, and that I was going to walk down the cable line and see if I can locate the trouble spot.  ""Hey, I have one of those rolling wheels that measures distance, would that help you?"" Uh, fuck yeah it would! I didn't have access (though I did get it later) to the program that showed cable maps, but I knew roughly where the cable went and it's easy enough to put a tone generator on the cable and trace it manually. He went to dig it out of his garage, while I drove to the other end of the cable to disconnect it from the access multiplexer. I went back, got my wheel on a stick, put a tone generator on the end of his drop wire, and I started walking from the side of his house, to the alley, and then down to a street.

Once I was approaching 400 feet I came to a large pedestal on a corner of two streets.  This seemed like the likely location for the trouble.  I popped open the pedestal cover, and uncovered the worst rats nest of wire I had seen to date in my career. Had to have been 250 pairs erupting in a tangled mess, insulation cracked and bare wire showing everywhere. Christ, no wonder this guy had trouble, probably EVERYONE with service running through here had trouble! However, I'm only here to fix one pair, so I dive in with my toner wand looking for the chimes of my tone generator.

Several patient minutes and several shocks later (ringer voltage hurts y'all) I finally located their pair. I cut off the damaged segment, put it in my pocket, and spliced the pair back together.  Put everything back, walked back to the house, and showed the wire to the customer. ""Here's the trouble sir. It was intermittently making contact with other wires."" He grinned and said ""I hope you'll understand if I say I'll see it when I believe it."" I grinned back and said ""I wouldn't have it any other way. Here's my number, call me if it happens again.""  Drove back to the box, hooked his wires back up, got my tone generator back, hooked his end back up, did my end of job tests, and got the hell out of there.

I kept those wires as a trophy at my little desk at work. No one gave me any shit about it. I kept tabs on that account while I still worked there, looking at his line history every now and then, and he didn't have a single outage after that day. No phone calls. Victory was mine, we had a happy customer to boot, and I went to work to get access to the aforementioned cable maps that would make future jobs easier to work, should I find myself left hanging out to dry again.",174,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF440400>
341,You want Linux? Happy to oblige.,"School (which happens to be my alma mata) placed an order for five desktop computers in early December. Distributor punted the order off to the SI I work for. Had a quick meeting with the school, who informed us they are clearing out a small area in the library for use as a second print location and decided that it wasn't worth expanding Windows licenses or paying for a new printer in such a small room, so the computers will have Ubuntu 20.04 and Libreoffice installed and the printer is a very old one that they yanked out from some other department.

I was about to object when the manager quietly put his hand on my leg and gave me the ""we'll discuss this later"" look.  Once the meeting was over I unloaded into him: my school has assignment templates that use heavy formatting guaranteed to break in Libreoffice (experienced them firsthand), that old printer's drivers were published during the Ubuntu 16.xx and Debian 8 era with no guarantee to work on newer versions and the central watchdog which formats the computers and reimages a clean copy of the OS every Friday evening has no Linux version. When classes resume in 2022, hell will break lose, so why put ourselves in this situation? His response was for me to do as they want and let them dig their own grave. So I did just that, made sure CUPS, the proprietary printer driver and Libreoffice were installed, packed up the desktops and sent them on their way.

Forgot all about the matter until my manager called me into his office last Thursday to inform me that the school's IT department got swamped with enough complaints about broken assignment formatting and printing issues that they closed off the new room and decided to reimage the computers with Windows and Office, but only after confirming with my manager that we will still honour the service contract. Sure we will, and perhaps next time the school board will know better than to trust some upstarts about jumping onto an alternative OS just to save a few coins on Windows and Office licenses without doing their homework.",211,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF440460>
342,Comprehension as an afterthought,"We got a ticket from the warehouse that was essentially ""we are trying to process a manifest but the system says the order isn't released for shipping"".

I checked and the order had been deleted.  It was gone. The warehouse guy had called the shipping system SME shorty after he logged the ticket which was at the same time I discovered the order was gone.  Fortunately I was able to jump into the call and save the SME from doing any redundant research.  Turns out that customer service had informed the warehouse **the day before** that the order was going to be cancelled.

So the warehouse guy had -

1. Failed to take the appropriate action when CS told them the customer had cancelled the order.
2. Failed to do the most basic research into the status of the order based on a plain language error the manifest system had returned.  

Fortunately our boss is getting as sick and tired of holding their hand as we are and doesn't squawk when we CC bosses on the polite ""do your job better"" responses to this type of ""it never should have been a ticket"" ticket.",12,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF4404C0>
343,You Never Know,"Initially I wanted to complain about Teams getting my users confused when I ask for Teamviewer, but I've decided to write a story I've been avoiding for awhile, mostly because I've found it hard to convey the proper emotions.

This is a story about an office in the middle of nowhere. I've had more consistent contact with this office than anywhere else in the company, having done over 40 tickets for them. There are 2 secretaries, and one has always been better at the job than the other. She's head strong, remembers how to do a shift+restart, does so before she calls in with technical issues and has never needed me to repeat an instruction. She is one of the few users whose name I choose to remember rather than being forced through bad experiences.

*ring ring*

Me: Hell Desk, this is Absinthe. How may I help you?

Dorothy: It doesn't work.

Me: What doesn't work?

Dorothy: The stuff I'm trying to do.

Me: May I have your username and PIN

**User Verified**

Me: Dorothy! It's been a hot second, how have you been?

Dorothy: The thing isn't working, I need it to work, please!

Me: Okay, just give me a moment and I'll try to see what's going on...

*Thankfully SCCM works in these offices and I avoid another fiasco of Teamviewer that drags these stories out to even greater length. What I see is the user attempting to save a PDF from Edge by right-clicking where the prompt would appear in IE.*

(Back story to that, our website where a lot of forms and contracts are stored is made of chewing gum and dog spit, so, for the last six months or so PDFs can only be saved directly from Edge and not in IE and Chrome, at least not without significant work arounds.)

*I click on Contract.pdf (13) and hit Save as.*

Dorothy: How did you do that?

Me: Dorothy, I hit save.

Dorothy: That's not what Sec2 does?! Why is it different?

*At this point Dorothy's breathing gets a lot heaver, close to hyperventilating as her voice begins to waver.*

Me: Hey, we've got this, let's just... take a breath, In... and Out... I know you've got this, we hashed this out a few months ago. Click where it says *Contract.pdf (13).* Good, now click Save As.

Dorothy: I don't know what we're doing, what's going on? Why doesn't this look like Sec2's work? Make it look like Sec2's work!

Me:... Am I talking to Sec2? This feels more like a Sec2 call than a Dorothy call.

Note: Absolutely f\*cked up here from a service standpoint, but when I get to know my users I get to know them, and across 40 tickets I have rapport with both Dorothy and Sec2. Dorothy and I make fun of Sec2 for not knowing how the ghosts in the machine work their magic. Sec2 and I make fun of Dorothy for always being rigid with the rules and having a bit of a stick up her @$$ and arguing with me when I change their workflow to counteract a glitch.

*Dorothy starts bawling into the phone. What words I can make out are self deprecating remarks about how stupid she feels and how everything is wrong. After a few minutes I tell her that I'll talk to Sec2 and figure out what's going on, that seems to calm her down somewhat. I ask her to transfer me and the call drops. When I call back into the office it sends me to Sec2.*

Sec2: Office in the middle of nowhere, this is Sec2 how may I direct your call?

Me: Sec2, this is Absinthe with the Help Desk, is everything okay? Dorothy seems really... really off.

Sec2: Oh, this is her first day back in the office after a while, poor thing had a stroke.

Me: She had a stroke and she's coming to work?

Sec2: She's gotta support her therapy costs.

(Another note: I've had 2 uncles that have suffered strokes, Masters in their field reduced to absolute husks. Literally 5 years of therapy before coherent words and thoughts were put together. It's been 15 years since and they can hold conversations now, but it's very clear that these are not the men I once knew. That's my colored bias on strokes, so it's absolutely shocking to me that she's even functional.)

Me: That's absolutely awful, I don't- I'm just going to compartmentalize that. She seems to be having issues with saving documents and wants to do it the way you are, can you show me?

*Sec2 shows me what she's doing, which is a much more complex way of saving the contract PDFs through IE. Though the thing that clicks for me is when the download prompt appears in the bottom-middle of her screen and she chooses her save destination. Dorothy has been copying Sec2 verbatim and the disconnect was because the file prompts were in the bottom left in her Edge program.*

Me: Thanks for showing me that Sec2, I get what the problem is now can you transfer me back to Dorothy?

  
**Call failed**  
**Call Back**

Sec2: Office in the mi-

Me: Sec2, what happened?

Sec2: *Dorothy, D-dorothy! When the light turns green pick up the phone, okay honey*? Poor thing.

**Call transferred**

Dorothy: Office in The Middle of Nowhere, this is Dorothy.

Me: Dorothy, good news, I've figured out what's different, and if it's okay with you, I would really like to get you back on the old way of saving files. Will you allow me to try?

Dorothy: Hon, I'm not sure what you're talking about, should I transfer you to Sec2?

Me: Dorothy, it's absinthe with the Help Desk, you needed some help making stuff look like Sec2's?

Dorothy: O-oh! okay, thanks hon.

*I attempted to get Dorothy back on track, with my 5 step workaround for Edge rather than the 9 step workaround for Internet Explorer. Thinking that simpler would be easier on her. We went over every step, multiple times, I inflated the mouse to show her exactly what I was doing, but in the end it was just too much. She needed to watch Sec2 do it and then follow directly after, so I guess part of her personality stayed intact, in the worst of ways.*

Me: Okay, So, we just have to right click here, and hit Save As. Nice. Okay Dorothy, now it's your turn, completely on your own, you've got this.

*The cursors shakes on her screen, attempting to go through the motions we just did without my prompting, but it stops dead with with a sob.*

Dorothy: What's wrong with me? Why- why can't I do it? This- this isn't me! Why am I stupid? stupid **stupid** STUPID **STUPID!**

Me: Dorothy, **DOROTHY.** You're not stupid, you're not, you literally have a brain injury. You're functional, you're human, you're just not all together yet, it's only been 3 months. **Three,** and you're back to work. That's superhuman in my eyes Dorothy, awful, but superhuman. Let's just get it set up like Sec2, I'm sorry for pushing so hard.

I haven't heard from Dorothy in awhile, I'm hoping that the company didn't just cut her off, but I have my doubts.

This is easily one of my most heartbreaking calls and it shouldn't have happened.





Edit: As Several of you have suggested I faced my fears and looked through our ticketing system and Dorothy was let go about a month after this incident in February of last year. 

I hope she is doing well, I have no way to contact her unfortunately. 

For a little bit of Levity when I was going to give Sec2 a name as well it turns out the name that popped into mind for anonymity sake was actually her name, so good on me for using Sec2 instead.",68,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF440520>

I worked as an IT Consultant for 25 years, never had a PM that was worth a dime.  

A few years back I was on a project working at a casino. My PM was terrible. We butted heads constantly and he never assigned me work because he just didn't understand my value and never took the time to look at what my skills were.  I tried repeatedly to educate him.  We were in a fixed price contract, so the faster we got done the more profitable the job was for our employer.  We had to make changes to 20k AD Contacts from Singapore and another 20k contacts from Macau.  PM priced it out as needing 3 people for 4 months or 4 people for 3 months.  I am a scripting expert and had it completed in 20 minutes.

345,A Total CF,"Public school IT here. This morning I get an email from my boss. The email is from a principal whining about how they aren't on the first wave of smartboard replacements. The boards are being replaced with cleartouch panels. Not my problem. I don't make those decisions, but also in the email it  states that they have 13 rooms with non working smartboards and or projectors. I'm quite puzzled by this because I have never been made aware of these issues. I email the principal and ask why these issues were never reported. She states it's because a principal from another school told her that everyone was getting panels soon. It's like a bunch of gossiping high school kids. Which, as a lot of gossip does, contains wrong info. I ask her for a list of the 13 rooms. I start going through them. Now, at this particular school they have smartboards with projectors in some rooms and interactive epsons in others. Well, the big gripe from these people is nothing is interactive. This is where it gets fun for the reader or infuriating for me. 

The school over the summer had painting done. The painters and maintenance unhooked everything and placed it on the stage in the cafeteria. It's important to note that this school district has the worst communication in modern history. I was originally told the painting was cancelled. Then two weeks later I arrive at the school to see everything taken apart. The district changed their mind. I was never informed. This means I wasn't in on the dismantling of the equipment. They paint the school over the summer. I ask the office people when will the painting be done. They say they'll let me know when it's done. As you can guess they didn't. The principal instead had everyone install all of their own stuff. Here's the kicker. They also decided that everyone would change rooms. That's fine.  IF YOU PUT THE COMPUTERS BACK IN THEIR ORIGINAL SPOTS. Nope. She told them to put a sticky note on their PC. Then take their PC to their new room. Thus, if you took your PC out of a room with a smartboard and put it into your new room that has an interactive projector it won't work because it doesn't have the software or sometimes the proper cabling and vice versa. So, Monday I have a bunch of work to do.

346,We traced the user and they're remoted in from inside the house!,"So we have a Microsoft Remote Desktop environment complete with RDGW, RDWeb, RDCB, and six (6) RDSH servers.  There are very few users who would need access to this because most of our employees have laptops with VPN access to the company network.  The few who don't (maybe they left their laptop at the office) they use our RDP environment to access one of the RDSH servers for a desktop session.

However, there are some users who need to use this to access a workstation at their office or a specific server.  To do this, they use the ""Remote Desktop"" tab or use an RDP client to connect to the RDGW, then to the workstation/server of their choice.


User: I work from home and I can't remote into my computer.

Me: Okay, can you show me the error.

User shows error message says resource can't be found.

Me: Okay, maybe your workstation is off.  I'm in the office, so let me know where your PC is at and I'll take a look.

User: What do you mean?  I have it here.

Me: So you're trying to remote into yourself?

User: No!  I have a work laptop (which has VPN to our office network) and I remote in on my desktop.

Me: *Confused....*  Okay... let me get this straight... you have a work laptop with VPN to our network?

User:  Yes.

Me:  Why are you trying to remote in?  Can't you use your laptop if you have it with you?

User:  I mean I can, but I want to use my gaming Desktop to work.

Me:  *light bulb moment*  So... uh... your work laptop and your PERSONAL desktop is in the same house but different room, and you want to REMOTE into your work laptop from your PERSONAL desktop?

User:  The laptop is right next to my gaming desktop.  I just don't have the space for two workstations.


Okay, I'm not going to argue with him - I'm just here to make the user happy...at least for now.  I'll be letting my manager know about this user though and let my manager deal with them.  Instead, I sent him a RDP file that's configured to connect to his work laptop LOCALLY without going OUT to the internet to our RDGW server ONLY to come BACK to access his laptop IN THE SAME ROOM!

Apparently having VPN access on his laptop also allowed our RDGW to reach his laptop, which is technically on our network.  I'll also be talking to our network team to block RDGW access to our VPN subnet going forward.

This just reminds me of the horror film trope: ""we traced the call and it's coming from inside the house!""


TLDR:
This user's RDP path:
Personal Desktop (home) ----> RDGW (company HQ) -----> RDCB (company HQ) -----> RDSH (company HQ) -----> Work laptop with VPN (home).

Was working for a while, but something ""went wrong"" (understandable since that's a complicated path).  My fix?

Personal Desktop (home) -----> Work laptop with VPN (home).


I could leave it there, but our policy doesn't allow laptops with VPN access to accept RDP connections.  The closest policy that would allow this is if it's a desktop workstation located in the office (which you can't bring home), we're allowed to give RDP access on that workstation to just that single user.  Even this is an OLD use-case since we've transitioned almost everyone to laptops with VPN.",49,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF440640>
347,The day I prevented a house fire,"I sometimes cover for my co workers on onsite school support. It was one such day when an 8th grade girl showed up at the help desk with a problem. “My charger isn’t working” she said and handed her student laptop to me. “Where is your charger?” I asked. Her eyes glasses over as she looked up from her phone “uhhh I don’t have it”. I asked her to locate it and come back. 

Fast forward several hours later. The student returns with her charger. “Where is your laptop?” I ask. I gaze into her eyes, there is no one home. “Uhhh I don’t have it” she mumbles. I send her away and she miraculously returns a few minutes later with both items. 

I take the charger, plug it in, and “BZZZT!” Sparks start flying. I yelped and yanked the flaming contraption out of the outlet. “Are you trying to kill me?” I joked. The young lady looked at me like she was staring through me, the wall, and out into space. She said nothing. “Do you realize that the wire into your ac adapter is completely cut?” I asked. “Uuhhh well it works sometimes” she muttered. 

Never mind, I thought. I located a spare cord, plugged it into her adapter, and that’s when I noticed that it wasn’t even from the right manufacturer! “Oh that must be my sister’s” remarked the student. Ignoring the fact that her sister (also a student) has the exact same model laptop I simply nodded my head and sent her on her way. 

And that, dear reader, is how I prevented a house fire.",37,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF4406A0>

I really Enjoy this job! And I've got a bigger Task yesterday to do on every Workstation in all locations.  


I have 2 Locations on my way home. One was already done. The second where only 4 ""Computers"". So I decided to leave my main location earlier, visit Location B, Solve the Task and go home.  
Arriving at Location B, My jaw dropped to the floor. Right next to the Entry door, the Network Stuff like Switch, Router, Patchbox etc flew (Yes, It was flying!!!) around the wall on their cables. The first room was occupied and had the ""Do not Disturb"" Sign hanging. So I searched for other Computers and.... GOTCHA! 2 Devices in one room on the first floor... so the second PC was booting... slowly... Grab a coffee and try the next one. A beige Box which seemed having a Floppy Drive BUT Windows 10... Well.   


It had a Blackscreen, I was only able to open Taskmanager. This machine was overloaded! Suddenly, BSOD, Beige Grandpa dead...! (RIP Beige Grandpa, 1990 BC - 2022)  


Meanwhile the long sleeping PC came up and I was FINALLY.... Well! Nice try. Also here the Operating System was not working. Most programs were missing. I made this PC running partially.  


PC Number 4 seemed being already on. It was glowing green but. ALSO DEAD! (RIP poor guy: 2009 - 2021) - Found a note. CPU Dead  


So, 4 Colleagues in an Office and maybe ONE working PC. When I tried to contact my supervisor, even the flying Internet was not Working. On every Printer a message: ""Please replace Toner!"" And of course, Nobody cares! But demands Documentations on Fridays.  


So I might have got a new Task for Monday. Bringing Location B back to life. Looks like I have to replace EVERY Pc there with a Working one, rewire the Network, Get Toner for 4 different printers.",22,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF440700>
349,How to make a senior manager roll his eyes and cringe at the same moment.,"Backstory: Back in 1998-1999 I worked for a company that had a contract to do tech support for a dial-up internet provider, which you probably can guess. This contact stated we had to have an average call time of 8 minutes which is super hard to do because walking people who literally just put their computer together and now wanted on this new thing called the internet. I had a few calls that I struggled to help them with and took 20-30 mins at times to fix.

Cast

Me

Senior manager (aka my boss’s boss boss) Nice guy and the first time I ever talked to him.

Story: One day a senior manager came over “Hey do you know you have been on this call for over an hour?” My reply “Yes sorry I had to teach this user how to double click icons.” 

The manager rolled his eyes and cringed after a minute for him to recover from this knowledge and a look of pity. “Are you almost done with the call?” I replied, “Yes I am wrapping up I will hopefully be done in the next 2-3 min.”

Manager “Good I will see to it this call is removed from your average stats. As I don’t think it's fair to count this call against your stats.” I replied, “Thank you for doing that.” 

The manager walks away shaking his head.",46,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF440760>
350,Project Manager refuses to accept he hasn’t done his job… even when proven wrong,"Evening all… everyone has liked my previous posts, so here is another one from a time I was lumped with a hopeless project manager that was quote: Too expensive to end the contract early with. Apparently he had a solid contract for 12 months, if they ended it early he not only got paid the full 12 months but also some extra stuff. I know… I didn’t have a say in his hiring.

The one thing I had going was that I was the Acting Director and I technically outruled him. The downside I was the only Sys Admin as well so at times I had to do things for him because his skills sucked.

This was in a school many years ago, we wanted to allow for multiple device work in the room that would allow for Mac or Windows devices to plug in or wireless stream their devices. Despite him being the project manager he was a classic sit on ass and send emails guy. He didn’t really do anything.

When dealing with the AV company I was the one who designed the box, layout and designed the network. We were using Apple TV’s, Miracast devices, and Crestron Controllers. Because of this we needed 5 network ports in one location of each room. He buildings were all full brick rooms and running network cables would have been expensive. I already had 1 port in each place, so we decided to put a 8 port HP Managed Switch in each room.

Despite the Project Manager being asked to design the documentation for the installation company I had to do it… apparently he couldn’t handle IP addresses in a spread sheet. So I built it all up. What each devices IP was going to be including the projectors, and everything else. I then provide the spreadsheet to him. He told me it was not aligned as he wanted and I needed to fix that… I didn’t have time and said the data is there… if you want it in a neater format you can change the fonts or colours yourself. He wasn’t happy I wasn’t doing it but didn’t push it.

Sixteen rooms were done in one holiday period and to begin with only the projects worked via directed connected cables. The Project Manager during this time never left his desk and when I asked or updates he would reply “Yep all on task.” After a week of this answer and during another meeting near one of the rooms that according to the timeline should be near done was no where near I asked the company. They said they hadn’t seen the Project Manager at all, and are emailing in issues.

I got the shits*, told him he had to do daily checks of their work and also to ensure that he is keeping on top of them. He wasn’t happy but didn’t really have any way of complaining about me. He did it, though I could tell he wasn’t happy with the daily walks, he was not a thin man.

* In Australia this can me angry and cranky... not just that you have Diarrhea.

Our switches were delayed, arriving so I couldn’t set them up before install, and the AV company were given them without config and installed. So a few weeks later after limited functionality I then went through and configured all the switches ones night. Config was as designed and everything seemed good and I went home.

The next day I came to work and was meet with angry staff from the Sixteen rooms that had nothing working. I apologies and jumped right onto it. I found the issues in minutes… and apologies for not testing more and would have them working ASAP.

I jumped into one room and checked the settings, they had meant to be in the range of 172.16.110.x, however when I started looking at devices I saw that they were actually 172.16.10.x. Which while not a used VLAN was not the range the switch ports had been configured for. To be honest I didn’t look into it heavily, as the Acting Director of IT I had way too much on my plate, my assumption without looking into it was that when the switches were not configured they were just letting anything past through. 

Though once I set up the switches and configured default gateways and VLANs it blocked all traffic, happy to be proven wrong here. But the facts remains and was tested after the fact, once VLANs were set it blocked the traffic.

I called a meeting with the AV Company and the Project Manager to figure out what had happened. At the same time my Helpdesk Team were running around changing settings so that at least the rooms would work with direct connections, manually changing the switch settings on 2 ports, projector and Crestron so they would go back to the weird communication method.

In the meeting with the AV Company and the PM, I asked why the right details hadn’t been set and the AV Company was unsure as they had followed the very formatted excel list and had done what was asked. I checked their print out and it was not what I had sent him… the PM said it was what I had sent, but in a more readable format as I had just sent a plain table.

I got my list and the PM/AV Companies list and the PM had changed it from what I had sent… the IP change had happened by the PM. He tried to blame my spreadsheet not being in the format he wanted and I should have done it. I apologies to the AV Company and asked them to please fix it and bill me the time difference. The AV Company said that is fine, but asked if they could get my version of the spreadsheet since it was easier to read and understand.

I organised a meeting with the Executive and PM and we went over the issue. At first the PM tried to have a go at me stating my actions in the meeting have ruined any chances of him getting future work from that AV Company, I said I am sorry I pointed out his mistake. One of the Executive laughed and he got cranky. The full weight of the issue was placed on him and not me (of course)… and he was told that they were lucky they couldn’t do it but they wanted to charge him the additional hours to fix the mistake.

Thankfully a couple of months later his contract ended, he did ask if it would get renewed and I said no way in hell. My advise was that we didn’t need a PM, that money would be better spent on teachers. He wasn’t happy… the Executive even saw my stance and didn’t even ask me to farewell him.

Thanks for reading… sorry it was so long and cut off mid way.",103,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF4407C0>
351,"""Let me talk to the president""","Got a fun one!

3-second backstory: I work with the software on fancy-ass treadmills(guess which ones, winner gets nothing at all) and the memberships for said fancy treadmills(or sometimes bikes/ellipticals/rowers)

Anyways, lady calls in. She's apparently been ""back and forth for hours"" with our team, which is already a red flag cos she's got four cases, count them *four* recorded times she's been in contact with us OR the parts-and-service sister department.

So she's had this issue, done just about everything, but the last time she did squat was a month or two ago. I start going through the troubleshooting steps because I don't trust 2+ month old tickets that only say ""did factory reset, waiting to see if it works"". So she decides that she's not even going to consider working with me, that she'd rather throw a hissy fit 'cos we won't replace her ""$20""(actually it's 50-75% of the cost of the $1k+ machine) built-in tablet(and by the way, the issue almost definitely wouldn't be fixed with a new console) and demand to talk to, and I quote, ""everyone"". she demanded the president of the company's email, the second in command's, everyone. Now, I don't really bother knowing anyone's email who I don't directly worth with or who I don't have a reason to have their email, so I have like, two people's emails(well, two who have any authority that I don't have) and I'm not about to go digging for emails I'm not going to need, especially when I don't even know if I'm allowed to see them, let alone give them out . . . anyways, she accused me of lying -- and I quote ""I'm not naive. Give me the email of the president and I expect to be called by them no later than 10 AM Eastern Time tomorrow morning"".

I probably did a no-no by just honestly ending the call right after that . . . but honestly, I don't really care, she was a jerk.",30,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF440820>
352,Let's NOT contact the desk and then wonder why nothing is happening.,"I need to get this off my chest because it's been happening a lot now after the holidays.


I am a manager at a service desk which provides l1/l2 support. I have this one particular client that seems to have decided that raising their issue with the highest level of management they can find, instead of actually calling my team for help is the way to go. The phrase ""just get it done"" has reared its ugly face a few times as well. 


So anyway, an executive had his password expire. They decided that calling the desk is not necessary, and instead went to their CTO (?). The CTO then proceeded to call our CEO(??), our CEO then sent the request further down the management chain, until it reached me after like 2 more levels. I then promptly proceeded to remind them that we need a call from the user so we can confirm the validity of the request and essentially told them to bugger off. 


End result? It took about 2 hours between the time the user reported their issue to their CTO and when a member of my team actually became aware that this issue exists. It then took a 5 minute phone call from the user to the desk to solve their issue. 


Also I may have to have a meeting with the CTO/CEO on why we didn't ""just get it done"" so on an unrelated note: If anyone is looking for a mediocre tech with irrelevant management experience, please DM me.",89,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF440880>
353,That’s not how it got damaged sir…,"The era: Early 2000’s (I think ‘01 or ‘02)

The cast: Me (OP) - A field technician working for a major wireless network provider doing field repairs on customer cell phones under warranty. 

Angry Customer (We’ll call him Bob) - Owner of a Nokia 3310, a pickup truck, and serious anger issues. 

The setting: A retail service center. 

I was working as a field technician for what we will call a “major” cellular services provider. This was of course well before data on phones were common, and this particular story involves one of the most indestructible devices known to mankind. A Nokia 3310 Bar Phone. 

I typically didn’t work in the retail location and primarily only dealt with business customers on-site. I was asked to cover the shift of a colleague while she went on vacation for a week. 

My very first day there, I was approached by Bob. Bob was a large man, 6’4” ish and a solid 300 lbs (yeah I’m American - go standard measurements!). Bob came screeching into the parking lot in his 1982 ChevroForDodge AirHauler, leapt down from its lifted frame, and came storming into the store. 

Now I’m a technician, so I don’t generally work with the customers - they have customer service agents in the store who deal with the customer, and then involve the technician if repairs are needed. I stay hidden in the back and do my thing. But Bob was a hard guy to miss. 

As I watch the customer service agent approach the man, he starts screaming and berating the agent that his phone had fallen from the nightstand and had shattered and that it was a defective device and f*%^ you and you guys always try to rip me off and on and on. 

Folks… this was not a cracked screen. This thing had been run over by a vehicle (I’m guessing Bob’s infamous AirHauler outside) or smashed with a hammer. I have heard reports this brick of a phone withstanding falls of over 50 feet before bouncing off the pavement with nary a scratch. This phone had not “fallen from a nightstand”. 

Cue my entrance. The CSR didn’t even need to come ask for me; I was already waiting. I approach Bob with a brand new, fresh out of the box 3310. I power the device on, wait til it loads up, then proceed to throw it on the floor and stomp on it. No surprises, not a scratch. 

Bob had to eat crow and the cost of a new device as I refused to process it as a warranty claim stating the customer had clearly taken extreme action on the phone. 

The funny thing is, we had full discretion to process any claim under warranty - but Bob was an asshat, so Bob got what he deserved.",157,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF4408E0>
354,Mom vs Grandma Mentality,"It's been a while since I've done much desktop tech support. But that doesn't stop my family from asking me a million questions every holiday season. I hope this fits into the sub.

Most of this year, my mom had been lamenting about her internet not working at speed. She had bought a new router, had her ISP check everything on the outside of the house and they said ""The problem has to be in your home."" 

So queue the family IT person. I come visit for the holidays and get asked if I can ""take a a quick peek"" which is never quick. I don't have a laptop and my Mom's won't boot up. Her exact words are ""I don't know what's wrong. It just gives me a black screen. But, that's okay. I need my internet for my tablet and TV more."" So, I pull out my phone connect to her wireless and turn off my internet connection. Run speed test. Less than 1 mb.

Yup, somethings broken. I take a look at the router and this thing is brand new. No reason it shouldn't be running properly unless it's misconfigured. I ask her if there is another internet connection I can plug the router into and check to see if it the router or the cable. Nope. Just the single connection. I start to trace the cable back from the wall, down to the basement, out to the POE. Great. Please don't be this cable, it's easily 100 ft long, there are no obvious points of damage, plus it below zero outside. 

I ask to borrow an extension cable, I run outside to freeze my fingers off and plug straight into the cable coming to the house. Asking myself as I'm dancing around in the cold exactly how the heck do I get into these situations so much. Dang IT!  It boots happily and I check the speed. 120+ mbs. FUUUUUU

I end up having to drive into town - 45 mins one way. Buy the cable and all the parts needed - about 140 bucks - crawl around in her basement including her spider infested crawl space. Rerun the cable, adding a few splitters so next time I might not also have to freeze while doing all this. And get her back up and running. Took me about 4 hours to run this cable and pin it up haphazardly.

But Mom is happy! I saved her 400 dollars, which was the price quoted by her provider. Yay! However, no good dead goes unpunished. She asks if now that, that part is done can take her laptop home with me and see if I can get it to boot up? I say no problem as I know I'll be back in a few weeks to help her with some other things and to finished pinning that cable up properly.

&#x200B;

Get home and my step son who also wants to go into computers asks if he can take a look. I tell him it's not backed up, so don't be deleting stuff, otherwise have fun.

He texts me about 30 mins later. ""It's slow, but it boots now.""

Me: Awesome, how'd you fix it?

Step-son: It was caught on downloads, I just waited it out.  ... Can I try to make it boot up faster?

Me: /facepalm... that makes sense. Sure! 

&#x200B;

 1 hr after that Step-son is pleased with his work and says it's running smoothly again. He disabled some things at start up, ran anti-virus scanner on it, and noticed the drive was maxing out at boot so ran a defrag, dskck, etc. Now it's all better.

Text my Mom: I had Step-son take a look, he said it was stuck on downloads so he got you up-to-date and cleaned it up so it runs a bit smoother.  You're good to go.

Mom: Great! Give him 50 bucks for his help. I'll pay you back.

&#x200B;

What? Seriously? I spent 100 bucks, crawled around in you spider infested crawl space for 45 mins, and saved you 400 bucks, and all I got was a Thank you! But my step-son does a few clicks and he gets 50 bucks! GAAAWWWHH!

355,"May Day in Moscow, or A Parade of Red Flags","This was sparked by the recent post by u/Ancient_Ice where someone was using a production system to learn Unix. 

A friend of mine, hereafter called **F**, used to study in a smallish (under 500 students) business and technology institute in the mid-90s. There was one Sun box for the student emails, shells etc., running an ever less current version of SunOS 4.something. There was a nominal admin, but he was rather busy, so the box was rather sloppily maintained by random persons who were given the root password and minimal instruction.

For example, F's roommate had root on the box at one time. He used his power and might to try out some old Unix jokes in csh. (Oh yes, the old Sun boxes offered a choice of shells: you could have csh **or** tcsh. Or  s-shell, in this case; we'll get to this later.) 

The depth of the problems started to become apparent in the early 2000s when F tried to access his email from my home and got a **Connection refused** message. I had a fancy Internet connection for the time - a fast DSL connection with a static IP and my own domain. I had my own firewall, so I could tell what was being blocked and what wasn't. 

F then tried opening an SSH connection to another shell server in a different domain, and telnetting from there. That was a success.

Now, most of you are probably wondering about the telnet part. F had been asking for ssh to be installed on the Sun box, to no avail. After years of begging someone finally managed to install something called *s-shell* - I still have no idea what it is. If someone does, please enlighten us! (edit: there are a couple of 2010s or 2020s projects with the name of ""S shell"" - those are different, this is late 90s to about 2002.)

Side note: many, including my employer at the time, were initially cautious about adopting SSH because of its license terms. In my employer's case it took a direct quote from Tatu Ylönen, confirming that it was absolutely OK to use internally, and only integrating SSH in a commercial product would be an issue. 

Once F had gained access to his shell account, we started investigating. A lot of the system was world readable, including home directories. However, we headed over to /etc to see what was going on. 

Reading through hosts.deny, it looked like somebody had run a random number generator and put the output in the file. There was also, among others, the entire TLD where I had my own domain - hence the **Connection refused** error. (hosts.allow was either blank or missing, so it was only hosts.deny that was controlling access.) 

Now, hosts.allow and hosts.deny used to be perfectly valid ways to control access to services - but this was a hot steaming pile of garbage. There were seemingly random sets of one to four octets, plus all kinds of domain names, including some of the largest global TLDs. For example, if any octet of an IP address had the value 151 (decimal), it was denied. Any connection from anywhere resolving to \*.com was denied. 

The most likely explanation was that whenever anyone spotted anything suspicious, they simply blacklisted whatever address the activity seemed to be coming from, sometimes - well, quite often - with a wide margin. 

There were lots of issues. Some common commands segfaulted. I remember laughing at this so hard that I fell off my chair. 

The worst thing was that someone was collecting passwords. We found a badly hidden text file of what looked like cracked or sniffed passwords. From the looks of it the password collector had been running at least a year. And F recognised his own password from the file, so at least some of the passwords had to be current. 

All of our findings were duly reported to the real admin. F ended up explaining the problems on the phone to a wall of ""so what"" until he got to the password list. At that point the admin's reaction was ""oops"". The box was shut down a short while later and never restarted.",17,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF4409A0>
356,Entitle Clueless Man," Well, I'm back to tell another tale from my life working in tech support.

 Players

Entitle Guy will be- EG 

I will be- OP

One of my many jobs back in early 2005 was helpdesk for investment reps. I had to deal with cell phones, desk landline phones, desktops, company personalized software, printers, and Microsoft software. I covered the whole United States. The one area I hated to deal with was Alaska, it was just one guy who could have worked from home, but he wanted the company to pay for his own office and since he had an office, he needed to have a Personal Assistant (PA)/Receptionist. He acted entitled, always asking for things he didn’t need, any problems he had it was a priority one, and if you didn’t do what he liked. He called his manager, your manager, a director, whoever he can get to get what he wanted. For some odd reason he liked me, and someone on my team gave him my direct line. (Whoever did that, may their meal orders be always wrong and all their deliveries are late.) 

One day it was 30 minutes for me to leave, and my direct line rang. I picked up my phone and behold it EG.  

ME: Hello this is OP. 

EG: Thank God you are there, this is EG, none of my office phones are not working and I need you to fix them. 

Me: Hello EG, I know you are not to call my direct line you need to call the help desk line.  

EG: This is important, I need this fixed. I got things to take care of and need my phone to get them done. 

Me: OK, so where are you calling me from? 

EG: I’m calling you from my office! 

Me: So, what are you calling me on? 

EG: I’m calling on my office phone! 

Me: OK..... What? 

EG: It’s not that hard to understand, I’m at my office calling you to tell you I cannot send or receive phone calls. Now get off your butt, do that thing you do on your computer, and fix this... NOW! 

At this point I’m confused, trying to wrap my head around this call and realize EG might have finally blown a fuse. I bet you guys are wondering, “OP what do you do with this kind of situation. Well, I put EG on hold call the other techs on the floor to sit around and listen to this. Told them what was said and they all grabbed their chairs, popped popcorn, sat back, and see how this situation will unfold. 

Me putting on speakerphone: Sorry about that EB, I had to put you on hold, can you please explain to me again what is going on. 

EG: Why did you put me on hold? Do you know how important I am!  

Me: I know EG, I’m sorry that I had to put you on hold but I need to get my system ready to help you fix your issue. Can you please tell me? 

EG: Fine, but this is the last time, I got things to do today. I got to my office and was getting ready for the day, I picked up my office phone and there is no dial tone. So, I remember what you told me I checked the line to make sure my phone was plugged in the phone and wall. I unplugged it from the wall and plugged it back in, still no dial tons. At that point, I called you. 

Me: And you are calling me from the office phone in the office, I got that right. 

EG: Yes, what don’t you understand!  

Me: Well, if you are at the office, on the office phone and you say it is not working. Then how are you calling me? 

EG: What don’t understand, I am calling on my office phone! You are an idiot and I cannot believe you could ever fix my stuff. 

Me: EG, if both of your office phones are down, you cannot call in or out. How are you calling me?  

EG: …........... 

Me: EG are you there? 

EG: …. Well... UM... I’m calling you in my office on my office phone.  

Me: The phone on your desk? 

EG: NO! I’m calling you with the phone in my hand! 

Me: EG, did you get a cell phone finally? 

EG: …. Well, no I got a company phone, I’m going to buy a phone for business use, I got them to get me a phone.  

At this point, there are several clicks that happened in my head. 

1. He has no idea that cell phones and office phones are different. 
2. While talking to him I heard in the background construction sounds 

Me: EG, are you outside or a window open?  

EG: … Window open. 

Me: EG do me a favor, look outside is there some construction going on? 

EG: Yes 

Me: Look out there where the construction is going on.  

EG: I’m looking 

Me: Is there a hole in the ground with a bunch of guys standing around scratching their heads? 

EG: Yes? 

Me: Yell out to those guys and ask them if the phone line is cut? 

I hear EG is yelling up to those guys, then he came back on the phone. 

EG: The phone line has been cut, and the phones are down, they are trying to get it fixed as soon as possible. 

Me: Alright then EG there is nothing I can do then. Have a good day. 

EG: UM … Good-Bye? 

I hung up, logged off, packed up, and left for the night. Went home and poured a nice strong drink, and laughed. ",62,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF440A00>
357,Theme & Variations,"Back in the olden days, I was the only phone support tech for one of the ubiquitous PC clone houses that used to advertise in the computer magazines. We had sold 200 computers to a software company that I'll call 4-5-6 Company. The first one went directly to a VP of the company to test out while we built the rest of the order. The sales rep came to me in a full panic, telling me that the machine, which I had tested before it left the shop, wouldn't turn on. 

I called the VP who said there were no lights on the machine at all. I asked him to look at the back and see if  the power supply fan (the only fan in those days) was spinning. He told me to hang on, he had to turn the light on. Wouldn't you know it, he had plugged it into a switched outlet.

The sales rep bought me lunch for saving his commission.",45,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF440A60>
358,When an idiot tries to use a production server to learn Unix,"Backstory: I worked on a windows helpdesk for a large company the remote offices all used Unix servers to run their print and file server as well as their local application. 

Story: About 630AM customer calls me up one day “My printer isn’t working.” My reply “Sure let me check the printer queue and see what’s going on.” We had a login to pull up a menu system to clear queues and a couple of other functions. When trying to clear the queue it said I didn’t have permissions. I was given a command-line login to do the same thing. Again, it told me I didn’t have permission to clear the queue. 

I walked over to the Unix Admin who just walked in. I explained the issue and he was surprised at this error. He logins to this server using Root, for the non-Unix people this is like logging into Windows using Administrator. When the Unix Admin tries to clear the queue, “You do not have permissions!” I said, “Oh crap there are WAY BIGGER issues going on than print queue.” Unix Admin “Oh yea big time.” I replied, “I will put a ticket over to your queue in a min.”

In the investigation, it was found out someone on the application team used the root login to play around to learn Unix commands more, he did a CHMOD 777 -R from the root directory. This changes every file/folder to read, write and execute for user group and all. In other words, messing the entire server's folder permissions up so bad it cannot function. He didn’t want to buy an old computer and just put Linux on to learn but instead used a production server to learn off of. 

The application team was given a different login to use that day and root was only used by Unix admin after that. The idiot who caused all this was yelled at to an inch of his life and basically told if he made 1 more screw up he would be canned. We were all shocked he wasn’t fired.

359,I don't do backups but I don't want to loose any data!,"Another tale from my University sysadmin/tech support days.

In my department we had a fairly robust data protection environment.  We were mostly a Linux shop for faculty and students, but our admin folks were totally Windows, so we always ran a small NT4 or later AD domain so folks' production files were always on our cool high availability server.  Linux users mounted their home directories on the same appliance.   For laptops we offered advice only, mostly we closed our eyes and hoped no one would do anything too stupid.  Biggest problem were professors getting their laptops lost or stolen while traveling, we would just kick to our university security team to deal with.   

This story deals with another department, a small administrative and finance unit.   This was basically four people who used Windows and had no server type solution.  Everything was stored on their desktops like a personal pc at home.  The admin person had come from a networked/server environment and really wanted that level of data protection for her folks.  We set up an AD domain and gave them a slice of our file server and things were good.  Except for the finance guy.

Finance Guy kept 100% of his email/docs/spreadsheets, of which he had thousands, saved on his pc.  He had no interest in using the ""server solution"", didn't want to have to learn anything, also seemed to not trust us to keep his data safe.  As if his un backed up desktop was safe.  The problem was his boss had no interest in forcing him to do anything different.  Admin Lady could suggest, nag, beg, but Finance Guy was a law unto himself.   We did get him an external backup drive and hook it up for him but we never knew if he was really doing backups or not (he assured us he was).

Finally the day came when this office decided to refresh the desktop machines for this group.  For everyone except FG, it was easy, but since FG had special needs, I met with him to figure out how to handle his migration.  He was perfectly pleasant to deal with, he just didn't want to think about it too much.  I just needed to make it work, and make sure he Lost No Data.  

I'm sure there are lots of folks who have had similar experiences, in the end I ordered a machine with a spare hd bay, pulled the drive out of his original machine and set it up as the D drive.   Showed him how to find it and explained that there is NO WAY any of his files could missing unless he deleted them.  

As far as I know he's still in the same job, doing things the same way.",30,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF440B20>
360,Maybe They Weren't Lying After All,"One of my very first calls when I started working in tech support was a user claiming that they were locked out of their computer because their cat walked on top of their laptop.  At that point in my life I had never owned a cat, and while I was new to IT I had enough life experience to know how people lie to save their pride.  I unlocked the account, but the call stayed in my mind as it was my first experience with (what I assumed to be) a lie of that kind, and I found it funny.

Fast forward about ten years, I now have two cats and Microsoft is in its lovely campaign of 'upgrade your PC Windows 10, it's free!!'.  I had no intentions of doing so that early on, and I wasn't even sure if my laptop would have been able to support 10.  I'm puttering around on my laptop, and had to step away to help my wife with something.  When I came back, I see my cat walking all over my laptop, and it's on a very unfamiliar blue screen.  I removed said cat from said laptop, and in the space of ten seconds experienced horror and relief.  I realized that she had inadvertently started the Win10 upgrade, but the laptop needed one more confirmation to proceed, and I could still cancel out.

My mind immediately flashed back to that call from a decade earlier, and I felt a little remorse for thinking that caller to be a liar - but not too much because I had dealt with so many other liars since.

And now I take extra care to lock my laptop, since now we have even more cats at home today!",80,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF440B80>
361,8 Working minutes.. 8 working minutes,"\*\*Posted this in r/sysadmin and some people suggested it would be better here, hopefully some of you share the pain\*\* 

Got a ticket few weeks ago assigned to me at 8:04am on a Tuesday. look at the ticket, it was from the day before. User put in a ticket needing help with a USB device at 630 pm, After hours..

I look at the ticket and as I’m looking at it, it’s maybe 8:05, another tech messages me saying he has someone on the phone looking for who was working going to be on her ticket.

I take the call, she’s irate. She wants to know why someone hasn’t fixed the issue yet. Well, we’ve been open for now 6 mins, and you put the ticket in after hours, and it wasn’t a emergency request that warranted after hours support.

I connect to her pc, can’t find the device plugged in to device manager. I ask her to unplug the device, and plug it back in to see if it helped. She unplugged the dongle from the HDMI port and then into a usb, and it magically worked… she gave 8 working minutes to fix a problem she created..

362,THEY TOLD ME TO KEEP MY DOCUMENTS THERE!,"Was helping a staff member migrate from an old XPS to a new Latitude laptop... Made arrangements for them to drop off their XPS and grab a spare whilst we backed up their user profile and restored it to the new device.  Pretty simple and straightforward operation that we do multiple times per day / week without issue.

User met me outside our office and was flustered because she was ""SOOOOOOOO BUSY!!!"" and didn't have time to be dropping off her old laptop and use a spare temporarily.  

Then hit me with this ditty:

'Will my recycle bin and emails transfer over?""

I must have had a puzzled look on my face as I had never heard this request before.  ""I'm not quite sure... Why?"" I asked.

""Well, you see, I make ORIGINALS and then email the ORIGINALS to people, so files don't live on my computer... They live in the email I sent to people.  And any files I do have on my computer, I was told to keep in the recycle bin for safe-keeping.""

Trying to maintain my composure... I started to go over what the recycle bin ACTUALLY is and how it functions and how it's a terrible place to keep files... Especially ones that you rely on.  And then went into an abbreviated version of how our emails live in the cloud.  But who the heck am I to be lecturing Mrs. Recycle Bin about how basic things function in an operating system???  She creates ORIGINALS after all!!!

She immediately started to throw me attitude and kept on with the ""I'M SOOOOOOOO BUSY I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR ANY OF THIS"" routine.  I assured her that we'd backup her profile and get it transferred over to her new laptop shortly thereafter.

She grabbed the spare laptop and charger and stormed off to her next Zoom meeting.  I proceeded to chuck her old XPS onto a workbench where it sat for most of the day whilst I caught up on other tickets and phone calls and whatnot.  Later on that afternoon, I booted her old XPS and proceeded with our normal backup process... Didn't even take that long (was only 600MB or so).  Restored the profile onto her new Latitude, shut it down and it *totally slipped my mind* to email her with the update about her new device being ready for pickup.

Came in the next day and had a ton of missed calls and several voicemails from ""you-know-who""... IS MY NEW COMPUTER READY??? JUST CALLING TO SEE IF IT'S READY!!!  CALL ME BACK IMMEDIATELY!!!

Sent her an email, once I had finished my coffee, that her new laptop was ready for pickup and to please call before coming down to our office.  Not two seconds later RING RING RING she's lighting up my phone:

I HAVE A SUPER IMPORTANT ZOOM MEETING IN 20 MINUTES CAN I COME GET MY NEW LAPTOP?  

""Sure"" I answered.  

IS IT GOING TO TAKE FOREVER TO LOGIN?  

""Since you've never logged in to the new laptop before... It could take anywhere from 5-10-ish minutes, even with the profile restoration"". 

AHHHHH I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THIS!!!!  

""We could do this later in the day"" I suggested.  

NOOOOO I'M SOOOOOO BUSY I DON'T HAVE TIME!!! 

""Maybe tomorrow?"" I asked.

She hung up on me after that. LOL.  Well what do you know... Who's beating on the office door not two minutes later... MRS. RECYCLE BIN!!!

I collect her new laptop and charger and open the door... She literally grabbed the stuff out of my hands and stormed off again... Didn't even want me to help setup OneDrive or Outlook or anything. Left the spare laptop on the ground.  All-around great person, I've got to admit.

What's scary about all of this is that she's a director or manager of some pretty important stuff in our company and pulls down a decent salary to go along with all that annnnnddddd keeps her files in the recycle bin.  Oh by the way... Did you know that she's super busy and doesn't have time for this and makes originals?

UPDATE: Thank you all for the upvotes and what-not!  I'm glad my misery could entertain so many!  There's no shortage of ""dumb stuff"" where I work... So we'll likely meet again shortly!  😁",155,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF440C40>
363,It is always the fault of the person that fixes the problem,"My wife and I are both educators working for our county's public school system. However, I was an IT guy for 35 years, and am often my extended family's go-to resource for technical support. 

Tonight, my wife wanted to add an Alternate Resource to her virtual class' Zoom meeting. Rather than ask for help (she's very aware of her Doctorate and much greater tenure, and salary, as an educator in our system than I, so feels she shouldn't need my help), she spent a lot of time trying things in Zoom without success. When she finally mentioned the problem she was having, I asked her to enter the person's email address (e.g., dorothy.road@ourschoolsystem.tld) in the Alternate Host field and not the name (Dorothy Road). That didn't work. 

I guessed that the person had changed her name at some time, and Zoom only had her old name listed, but our mail system has both (one's an alias, I assume). I asked my wife to type just her first name in the To field of an email. Voilà- there were two entries, with the same photo - Dorothy Road and Dorothy Jones. My wife insisted that they had to be two different people until I pointed out the identical photos.

Entering dorothy.jones@ourschoolsystem.tld as the Zoom Alternate Host, pressing return, and then Save, worked. Elapsed time: 3 minutes. Yay? No. Apparently, it is my fault that she wasted an hour trying various things without success, made worse that I seemed to know what the problem is immediately (it was just a good guess based on experience). 

Sigh.

TLDR: ""User"" is annoyed that ""tech. support"" couldn't solve her problem before she asked for help.",26,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF440CA0>
364,I thought I was done with her.....,"We had a clinical supervisor for years at my work... computers were not her thing.  Any change in a system,  required months of repeating and handholding.  Which made me, the admin/onsite it goddess spend many hours guiding her to do the same tasks pretty much every day. 

She decided to retire this past June (THANK GOD since we were rolling out a new database for case notes) and I thought my problems were behind me.... nope... we brought her back to do supervision for our practicum students. 

Today she had her first virtual supervision.  We use a web based platform like zoom, but more secure, and when appointments are set up for new people (like her personal email), you get an email asking you to set your password.  

Today, at the time of the appointment,  she calls me in a panic asking me what her password is.... 

????? 

I tell her she set her password... I don't have it. She then tells me ""BUT YOU HAVE ALL THE PASSWORDS! WE HAVE TO GIVE THEM TO YOU!!!""

I told her that I have all passwords for the WORK email things, I don't have personal passwords.  If she can't remember what she set the password to, she will need to re-set it.

366,"Users lie, they always lie, and never does it make any sense","For better or worse, I'm not actually in a tech support role. Just a measly new addition to the dev team, mostly poking around with frontend design. But with everyone out of office for the holidays, someone had to man the dreaded custumer support inbox last week - and the powers that be decided that even without any relevant training, I would suffice.

I figured that'd be fine. I generally know what our tools do, and in the worst case scenario, I may even find it in me to skim through a user manual. So it's just me and this inbox for two days - what could possibly go wrong?

People. People and input fields, that's what.

Bright and early on day one, we get a ticket saying that the date filters are broken: the client wants to see user entries from database for November, but our tool is showing them results for October.

I try to reproduce the error on a test database, everything is fine. But when I try the same on their data, it really is all for the wrong month. I stare at the output table for a few moments, it stares back at me. Neither of us budge as I go down the mental list of what the hell could the problem be, and I'm ever so slightly freaking out because if our date filter is somehow broken right before peak reporting time at the end of year when *everyone* wants to see their data, that would not be good. But then I see it: the date column.

Or rather, a string of lies pretending to be the date column.

I check the output display settings and the actual date column is still set to hidden, as is the default. I change it and boom, would you look at that: all entries are suddenly from the right month. But then what's the impostor date doing there? Where did that come from? And actually, why is it just a text variable?

Of course, I think. Of course, they would ask their users to add a date of their own to their entries when that's already automatically generated. And of course, they would store it as text as cherry on top.

I replied to the ticket with an overly detailed screenshot explaining how to filter by the actual date of entry, and gently nudged them to maybe consider *not* asking users for factual inputs and expecting them to be correct.",36,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF440DC0>
367,I cleaned files off my computer and now it won’t boot.,"Backstory: This took place early 2000’s with Windows 98 still commonplace. I worked on a Windows help desk, and we would get all kinds of calls when people did stupid stuff to their computers.

Story: One day I answer the phone “Hello help desk.” Customer “Hello I needed to make more room on my hard drive and I cleaned some files off my computer but now it won’t boot, and I cannot figure out why.”

I cringing as I know this will not be a quick fix. “How did you clean these files off your computer?” The customer replies “I did a file all files anything over 5MB and deleted them all.” 

Yes, you read that right she deleted all files over 5MB in size. 

I replied “Well sorry to inform you but you have just turned your work computer into a paperweight. You made more room on your hard drive by deleting windows and every program on your computer.” I explain the next steps and inform her someone from our tier 2 will be contacting her shortly.

I walk over to our Tier 2 group and tell him “Hey I need you to rubber-stamp this through to get the users workstation reimaged.” Co-worker “You know we can not do that without troubleshooting the issue.” I hand him a printout of my ticket, “Are you sure you want to troubleshoot this?” After reading my ticket co-worker “Never mind approved!!”",69,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF440E20>

369,When legacy equipment goes bad,"Happy new year everyone.   
Yesterday it was monday the 3rd and I was happy to start the new year full of optimism and still high on holiday cheer! We've got a new colleague who's going to be replacing the one who stepped in front of a train last year, so all things are looking up.

Until the network at one of our biggest locations crapped itself. The usual happens, calls start coming in through Topdesk, chats and phone calls, the WiFi and wired network at our regular site has become incredibly unstable. 

It looks a lot like something we'd experienced at the end of November at another sattelite location where the internet service became unreliable because we were structurally using more bandwith then the modem could handle. 

My colleague starts his troubleshooting on site, and does the usual lvl 1 stuff, modems get reset, firewalls as well and for a little while it seems to work. Services are restored and we all breathe a sigh of relief. 

But alas, that relief is short-lived, pretty soon the calls resume, clearly rebooting all that stuff did not help. Now we've got an external party who manages our infrastructure and in these cases most of our job is liasing between the users and NCC. But they also operate a standard helpdesk for the other services they offer.

The fun bit about this is that one of our users from the manager level called this helpdesk and told them about the problems and this helpdesk guy told him that he had to ""call his ISP to get this resolved"". So yeah, great service on their part...*not.* 

So, I take the new hire there so he can get his access keys & stuff from HR while I do some more troubleshooting and get in touch with NCC. Thankfully I know the magic lingo and quicly get past the helpdesk jockeys and start talking to NCC, who start diagnosing. We do another firewall reboot, but the connection remains unstable. But it's not entirely fruitless, the NCC guy can see packets dropping between the firewall and the main switch! So it's not the ISP but the switch that's faulty. He asks me to reboot the switch, and when I do that, everything goes to hell. The switch reboots, but all the blinkenlights stay on completely and the network, what was left of it slows to a *crawl*. (Well there goes my evening).

The guy from NCC tells me he wants to send over an engineer and it'll take two hours for the guy to get there. By the time he tells me it's already 14.30 so I go around the building and let everyone know, the internet won't be coming back today. 

The field engineer arrives spot on time (good man) and starts work. It gets too technical for me to follow, but he tells me that it looks like the switch isn't broken, but that one of the ports has been looped. and that the Spanning Tree Protocol isn't running on our switches. Now this is kinda weird. It's Jan 3rd. We haven't had people doing anything with the workstations, the last time we had any changes was well before christmas, so if anything got hooked up incorrectly, we should have found out before the holidays. He's the expert though, so I start going through the reconfigured offices to see what comes up, but what comes up is nothing. Everything's hooked up the way it's supposed to be. So the troubleshooting continues.

The engineer gets in contact with one of their third line experts, who remotes in to the engineer's laptop which is hooked up to the switch, and they start doing their thing with network traffic and eventually find the port that's generating a boatload of traffic.

They trace the cable and unplug it, wham! Problem fixed! The network breathes to life almost immediatley. So it's definately a bridge loop. But not in one of the remodeled offices. How strange. Well I start looking for the port that's been unplugged and three floors up I find a little old switch lying on the floor in a small room where there's 2 network sockets in the wall, 2 Chromebox setups and a networked printer.  And for some reason, a spare UTP cable, that's plugged in to te witch, guided through a cable gutter underneath the desk, and going right back to the second network socket in the wall.

If only I had a hammer on me, it would have been cathartic.

Instead I unplugged that damn switch, plugged in the printer and one of the chromeboxes, and went back down to thank the engineer for his time. No idea how that ancient thing got there, but I'm glad to be rid of it.",36,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF440EE0>
370,We have had an incident with a USB stick,"**This story pertains to an incident which happened at a high school in the early 2000s. I was on work experience and shadowing the tech support**

**Context of the Story:**

This high school is located in an impoverished area, where the majority of families are in receipt of some form of social security, welfare or food stamps. The school itself didn't have a fantastic budget, so was for the most part still using chalk boards, 20 year old textbooks etc. In regards to computing, the school had no more than around 25 PC's (running Windows 95), which were for use by staff only. Therefore, a good portion of the school population (~1200 pupils) had never used a computer before. There was an old tech support guy who had been there since the late 80s who had been trying to establish some form of computer literacy class for several years to no success.


Fortunately, the school was awarded a very generous grant by the local government to 'modernise'. This resulted in over the summer vacation, the school purchasing ~150 brand new PC's with Windows XP installed, and the full suite of Word, Publisher & Powerpoint. Each teaching room had also been installed with interactive white boards with projectors, and a room had been converted into a computer room, to run the computer literacy classes which the old tech support guy had wanted. Unfortunately he was extraordinarily upset, as a new tech guy (~20 year old) had been taken on to replace him, and had been in charge of the procurement of the new PC's, their installation, and the ongoing tech support. Old tech guy had been assigned to become a full time tutor for computer literacy (for both the children and fellow staff). To be fair he did enjoy this job, but absolutely hated the new tech guy.


**Story:**


One afternoon, the new tech guy received a call from the old tech guy stating *'we have had an incident with a USB stick, can you come down please'*. We arrived at the computer room a few minutes later to see nothing short of minor destruction. The computer room featured a 'nest' of computers on a donut shaped table (round with a large hole in the middle) in the middle of the room. In the middle of this 'nest' was a mess of kettle leads (for the monitors & PC), ethernet cables, & wires for various peripherals. At least, that is how it had been left before this 'incident'. What welcomed us was all 6 of the tower PC's plus their CRT monitors had all fallen into the the whole at the middle of the 'nest'. 


Apparently what had transpired, an over-eager student had tried plugging their USB stick into a USB slot at the front of the PC, and had managed to push it off the back of the desk. When this PC fell off the back of the table into the centre of the 'nest' the weight of this tower dragged the CRT monitor with it. The combined weight of these hitting the web of wires in the centre of this 'nest' had led to a chain reaction where the rest of the PC's & monitors were all pulled into the hole in the middle. Not to mention a few of the keyboards and mice had also been dragged in.


The old tech came across to the new tech smiling like the cheshire cat from Alice in Wonderland, asking that the new tech fix the problem. We spent the next hour untangling the mess of wires, and extracting the PC's & monitors from the middle of the 'nest' (some genius had screwed the desks to the floor). Eventually the final inventory of damage was as follows:

* Three CRT monitors had become irreparably damaged 
* Five HD's were damaged beyond economic repair
* Two of the power ports required replacing
* Three of the tower frames needed repairing
* One graphics card had shattered, along with damage to the motherboard
* One keyboard was damaged beyond repair
* One mouse needed (of all things) a replacement ball (I have no idea why)


**Would you believe it, but the USB stick survived the destruction!**

I stayed with the new tech until the end of the shift, at which I went home (after all, I wasn't being paid). I arrived 9am the next morning to discover that he had spent the entire night replacing the hardware (had cannibalised from other PC's around the building), and reinstalling the OS + the various softwares required. This was the experience that led to me not choosing a career in tech support. A week of experience had been enough. But I wanted to share nonetheless!",38,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF440F40>

372,"""How was I able to reset my password then?""","Here I go with another one. Every workplace has that 1 perso  who forgets their password after a week or two of vacation. God help me.

I get a Teams message from a user stating that she is not able to login. Here I am assuming VPN, so I figured, ""okay I can reset her AD password and she can get into VPN and cache it to the laptop later"". No...

She forgot her password to log into her work laptop. Mind you that we are working remotely and the laptops are not connected to the domain unless they are connected to the company VPN. The following is what happened:

Me: Hey, so I went ahead and reset your password try logging in again.

User: Okay I see the Welcome screen spinning then it says incorrect password

Me: Oh! You're attempting to sign into the laptop itself. Gotcha. Let's go ahead and try the last known good password.

User: I will try again, but it keeps saying incorrect. I've been gone for two weeks.

Me: That sounds like a well rested vacation! 

User: It says the password is incorrect. I don't understand it shows the Welcome loading message then says Incorrect Password. Why does it do that?

Me: This happens when the laptop is trying to check the entered password against what it remembers.

Note: I put things in layman terms all the time, but this time it went no where.

User: Okay, but I tried the reset password as well and that did not work!

Me: Unfortunately, that will not work until we get to a later step. For now we have to try to sign into the laptop using the last known password

User: No, there was something else you did last time where I worked remotely and you reset my password and it worked.

Me: Yes, I do believe I assisted, but in that situation we had you sign into the laptop using your old credentials, sign into the VPN using the temp password, and you were able to change the password by doing CTRL+ALT+DEL, Change Password, remember?

User: No, that's not what happened. You changed it and I was able to log in right away.

I was getting ticked off at this point. We have a specific way of having users change their passwords while working remotely and she was telling me that's not how it happened. She kept asking me why it worked last time and it wasn't this time. I kept re-iterating that the laptop must be connected to the company network to check against your new account credentials. She wasn't having it, so I offered a solution until she could come into the office to have her log in to the laptop while connected to the company's network.

I can't stand when people can't take accuntability. You tell me you went on vacation for a week last time and it happened then..you forgot. Now you take a two week vacation and forget your password again. I'm trying to help, but you telling me that I did something differently when I am telling you that entering your cached password is Step 1 is very frustrating. 

/EndVent

Edit:
I had the user go into the office to have the laptop contact our domain and I made sure they disconnected from it and logged into their laptop to ensure the cached credentials were working. The user also said ""thank you for being patient with me"". It's the least I could do 😐",75,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF441040>

This particular client came to me in need of tech support, claiming she was unable to get her previous tech guy to answer her at all.  If only I had seen that as a red flag, but she sounded desperate on the phone and her business depended on it---she runs a bookstore on an island and IT shops/repair folks can certainly disappear for other reasons.  So, I agreed to help.

The first issue was that she couldn't arrive within normal store hours (9-5).  She'd show up at 4:59 and then camp out and chatter away for an hour.  No big deal, stuff like that I just add a bit extra on the final bill and explain that it's after hours.  The first job for her was painless---cloning two laptop drives over to solid state drives.  Easy.  She comes in to pick them up, hangs around talking for what felt like forever, and then returns to her island.

Now I tell most clients that my favorite thing is to never hear from them again---or at least for a long time, because that means I've done my job and that things are working as they should.  It had been about a month since the clones and I see that she is calling.

Keep in mind, for these conversations I am doing you all a **huge** favor and removing/abbreviating the long diatribes she would go into whenever it was her turn to speak.  I don't have the energy or the time to type out---nor the memory.

**ME**:  What can I do for you?

**BookStoreLady**:  My emails are gone!  All my important emails are gone----my vendor lists, my order summaries, the important contacts I use to keep the book store running! (insert 10 more minutes of talking about the same thing)

**ME**:  Ok, ok.  Bring the laptop by and we will have a look together.  The cloning process would not have deleted any em---

**BookStoreLady**:  I know!  They were there up until yesterday!  Now it's all gone!  I don't know what has happened!

**ME**:  Head on over and we will take a look.


She arrives, flustered, distraught, agitated.

I open up Outlook and then hand over the laptop so I can see what her process is.


**ME**:  Okay, so walk me through it---show me what is missing.

**BookStoreLady** (yelling):  MY EMAILS ARE WHAT ARE MISSING.  I NEED THESE EMA---

**ME**:  Lower your voice.  I'm not going to be yelled at when I'm trying to help you.  Please just walk me through it and show me your process.


She starts angry clicking through her emails while explaining her process of NOT SAVING CONTACTS but rather just keeping their emails and searching for their names and continuously replying to old emails.  I start to feel bad for the laptop with every ""angry click"" she makes, and then I remember the IT guy before me who ghosted this lady, and then the other people she mentioned---her website designer, ghosted her also.  I start to think about changing my name, moving my business location....disappearing...


**BookStoreLady**:  THERE!  See!  Nothing shows up!  That's the name of one of my biggest vendors but there's NO EMAIL!  All of them are *angry clicks* GONE!

**Me**:  Hmmm, all right---was there a folder you created that you used to store these emails?  Maybe a place you saved them or organized them?

**BookStoreLady**:  Yes!! Yes there is!  Here....

I watch with horror and dread as she moves the pointer to the motherfucking TRASH FOLDER and angry clicks on it.

**BookStoreLady**: I keep all my important emails in here.

**ME:**  Th-that's the trash folder?

I was honestly just not sure of anything anymore.

**ME:**  You...you can't keep important stuff in there...there's usually a time limit on how long stuff stays in there....before it gets automatically deleted.

**BookStoreLady:**  They've ALWAYS been there---WHY AREN'T THEY THERE ANYMORE?

**ME:**  I imagine they auto-deleted.  You...I'm sorry, you'll have to reach out to these people and get their contact information and I'll show you how to create contact lists and back them up so tha----

**BookStoreLady:**  I. WANT. MY. EMAILS. BACK.

Each word emphasized with an angry click on the outlook trash folder---empty, still.



**ME:**  Then you shouldn't have stored them in the trash folder---I'm sorry there's nothing I can do to retrieve this.



I'd love to say ""that was that"" and the lesson was learned.  She left, and I'd later help her migrate her domain email over to GMAIL, again...emphasizing the importance of saving contacts, and not moving important emails to the trash folder for ""safe keeping"" (her words).  But then, sure enough, the phone rings and it's her.  About 3 months had gone by.  Luckily, I'm onsite doing work and my policy is to typically not answer my phone when I'm onsite anywhere.  It goes to voicemail, which she kindly leaves a 10 minute ramble-thon of issues relating to her emails missing again....


By the time I get back to the office she has written an email.  She explained she had tried her old method of keeping the emails in the trash again, just for a day or so this time!  And sure enough they were gone!  She needed those!


I exhaled a long, sad, sigh and replied to the email---explaining that, again, the trash folder was not the place to store emails of importance.


Is it over?  Not really.


She would soon start SHOWING UP unannounced (still between 4:59 and 5pm) just as I would be walking out the door to demand help on things that were akin to throwing paper into a campfire and then wondering why it burned.


After the 3rd after hours surprise show up I made it clear I just couldn't help her anymore.  My advice wasn't being heeded, and there's nothing more I could offer her.  She'd still call every now and then and leave a long rambling voicemail.  When I switched to a different company, I migrated my phone contacts as well----and sure enough, about 2 weeks after the move my work phone rings and I see the incoming call contact name:  INSANE BOOKSTORE LADY.

I declined the call.",159,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF4410A0>
374,My Earbuds Don't Work :(,"As the resident programming/technology enthusiast my family, and sometimes the less tech savvy neighbors/acquaintances, come to me with whatever tech problem they may be having at the time, using me as some sort of rudimentary tech support, and today I was approached with yet another tech issue.

Our neighbor came to me asking for help since his new wired earbuds didn't work correctly, he wanted to listen to music on his phone but the phone still played music from the speakers. Naturally, this causes problems with others who may not share your musical taste, or just might not want to listen to your favorite song on repeat.

I ask my neighbor to show me the issue, and what he does is absolutely baffling: *He goes into the sound settings and plays the music through the ringtone selector* which then plays the music through the speakers... because it treats that specific output as a ringtone, and ringtones play through the speakers to make sure you can hear them and do not miss a call. The ringtone volume was maxed out while the media volume was set to 0.

I set the media volume to a reasonable level and open up youtube to play a random video to check my hypothesis and, as expected, the video plays through the earbuds, and the speakers don't let out even the slightest electrical hiss.

I install a music player app for easier access to audio files on the phone and hand the phone back, the issue is resolved and I am given undeserved praise for doing practically nothing.",68,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF441100>
375,A stubborn condescending caller,"Short back ground story:

I was working at a large BPO-IT service desk company for 4 years. During that 4 years we were a voice account, meaning we get calls to troubleshoot and as mush as possible to resolve the issue on the call, we can also remote in to the computer if need be. This happened before the pandemic of covid-19

Fortunately we only support employees of client company, so most of the caller are calm and collected. The company is considerate and also employs senior citizens and usually works at home, and depends on their role/job they will be using either personal or company provided computer.

&#x200B;

Main Story:  


Okay to add a little more info for the story, this is about being sent secure emails cause since the end user is not using a company computer and doesn't have yet a company email, they are being sent to her by secure email. 

FYI if not familiar with secure email. if one is sent to you you will have to log in to their company's secure email site to view or read the email.

Now on with the call. right off the bat the caller is already an irate caller. I was trying to deescalate the call so that she can properly explain on what her is issue is and why is already irate. The issue here is that when she is trying to log in to the company's secure email site/page she keeps getting the message ""Session Expired, please log out and back in to get/refresh session""

From the error I seem to know some causes of that but just to make sure I ask ""how were you opening the site"" and she answered me as if is should know the answer ""where else from the computer"". from the tone and how she answered I know this caller is stubborn and some time does trust IT support and seems making it hard on purpose. So I calm myself down and rephrase my question ""I mean like how are you opening the site ? like is it saved on the computer or a link from an email"" and still in a irritated tone ""it saved in the computer""

From much probing from her. The issue is that she bookmarked the login session of the secure email and keeps using the link to view her received secure mails but (don't know if all company secure email sites does this) the login session last for like a few hours after that will say that's expired and you need to access the home page and either login again manually or reset your password.

I tried to explain to the caller the issue and how to fix the issue in a permanent way but she said shouting at me ""I am not tech savvy, so i don't want to login and enter my username and password every single time I just want to just click and get logged in immediately without all that login and password crap"" I tried explain in a way more basic way that the session expires every few hours cause of security reasons but she would not accept any other way than the way she wanted.

So I gave up explaining after like 3-5 times. and just assisted the user in getting her password reset (all the while sighing as if this is the company is making it hard for her like every time as her to type liker her email or password before typing you will hear 1 big deep sigh) and getting her logged in. I deleted the bookmark and replacing it with a new one. She did say thank you before hanging up

In my company every Friday we get all the surveys our callers filled out and submitted. From the caller mentioned above she gave a negative survey cause I didn't fix her issue and it occurred again have to call call us back again and specifically said that I was no help.

On good side of this the call went into QA and got perfect scores for both ticket documentation and call flow.",44,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF441160>
376,A Feel-good Family Tech Support Tale,"Seeing some other feel-good stories inspired me to post this one from just this past week. Have been reading your stories furiously since joining Reddit last year, but this is my first post in this subreddit. TLDR at the bottom:

My fiancee and I traveled to the Midwest (USA) to see her parents. Due to COVID-19 we have not seen them in just over 2 years. Since extended family Christmas was cancelled due to Omicron, and both her parents and the two of us being fully vaccinated, we felt comfortable going to her hometown to spend Christmas with them.

My in-laws are getting ready to put their house on the market and had some home repairs to take care of, so I made sure to bring my power drill out to help out (I'm the son of a handyman so I've learned several things since I was a child). While finishing up one repair, my MIL mentions that my brother in law's laptop has stopped working and asked if I can take a look at it. I happily agree and get to work on it. They assumed the laptop was a lost cause, but I was up to the challenge.

Immediately I figure out it has to be the battery because the computer is having issues fully booting up, even when plugged in. My laptop was having the same issue earlier in the year. Unfortunately for me, my laptop is completely soldered in so I had to drop the $$$ to get the battery replaced, but my BIL's battery is removable, so I was able to order one at the local electronics store. Then I messed around and realized that both the hard drive and memory could be upgraded, so I figured as a Christmas present, I would upgrade everything and give his laptop more life.

I go pick up the parts the following day, make the switches to battery and memory, add the SSD (and move the HDD to the DVD/CD drive), and voila! Computer is working like a beaut! I proceed to clone the HDD and copy everything over to the SSD. I follow a video online and seems like it did it properly (that was the first time I'd cloned a drive). I wipe the HDD and restart. Oh no. I get the dreaded blue screen. I fiddle around for another hour and realized I done goofed. I go to bed with plans of getting a USB the following morning at the store so I can reinstall Windows.

In what has to be a lucky accident, when I cloned the HDD I created a partition in the SSD, I left half a gig unclaimed/unused. I used that to create a new partition to reinstall Windows and got the computer up and running without hassle. I also managed to save my BIL's files (last time he had used the laptop, also 2+ years ago, he was applying to jobs so this laptop had his only copy of his resume) due to the partition, so despite my earlier goof ups, nothing was lost. My BIL was very appreciative that I took the effort to fix his laptop, he gave me a coin from his collection (a silver dollar from the 1800s). Unbeknownst to him, I also love collecting coins, so he and I now have a common hobby to connect over. While this was a favor for family, I'm glad my goof up didn't cause anyone any lost files. I also will endeavor to learn more about cloning hard drives before I get to work on upgrading my fiancee's laptop so I don't repeat my mistakes.

TL:DR- in laws ask me to take a look at brother in law's laptop. I upgrade it and goof up while cloning drives. Fortunately, I was able to fix my mistake and return to my brother in law a laptop that was assumed to be a lost cause, working in better shape than before and without losing a single file!

EDIT: thanks for the awards and tips! Those will really come in handy for the future. You're an excellent group of people and I'm happy to be part of this community.",29,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF4411C0>
377,Production Database Backup,"Many a decade ago, whilst working for a software house, a client came a little unstuck with their database backups.
 
On the client’s server were a number of databases, they normally were named in a specific pattern, like {software name}\_SOFTWARE or {software name}\_{client acronym} for their production data, and we’d typically advise them to have at least 2 other copies, that were named something like {software name}\_{client acronym}\_UAT and \_TST. Now we could only advise, and could not enforce, on their suggested backup cycles/policy.
 
We received a frantic call from the client one day, they’d had some server problems and had started up a new server and restored the backup onto it, but their production database was missing. So, we obtained their backup media (a DAT) and reviewed it ourselves, plus multiple previous days and scheduled monthly tapes. Each one was the same - our software, plus the test and UAT database but not their production database (side note: UAT was a copy of production that was about 3 months old, but we had this process they would run that would prune and mangle all PII so was effectively useless). Whilst some serious s**t was about to hit the fan at this customer, a saviour presented themselves - in the form of a marketing bod who had just returned from an industry conference and had requested a backup of the production database prior to going.
  
So with a 3 day old backup they were able to recover their system, and make any missed changes manually. Someone in their IT department got the boot - apparently with the production database also being backed up onto the DAT it went onto 2 tapes, so they decided to remove one of the databases to put bring it back to fit on 1 DAT.
 
Unsurprisingly backup processes at that client were changed and they implemented a new strategy whereby they also restored the production database on to the back server frequently.
 
That was an intense few days on the support desk.
 
TL;DR client back excludes production database, single copy taken by chance is only/latest version.

Edit 1: corrected the escaping of the underscores in database names and some of the grammar.",46,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF441220>
378,A lot of wires,"I set up a laptop for an exec who said that's a lot of wires for a wireless computer. She said the laptop wouldn't connect when she was home. Turns out she didn't have wifi at home, just assuming the laptop should wirelessly connect to the existing network and printer automatically.  I tried to explain she needed a wifi router and wireless mouse, keyboard, and likely would connect the printer to the home network for wireless access. I even set up a docking station. She says I'm so technical that she doesn't understand a word I'm saying and still doesn't see why her ""wireless laptop"" has to ""have wires"". I finally convinced her the wifi was an upgrade to her internet service. Someone else set her up when she got wifi setup by the cable company but she still says they ""fixed her laptop"". When someone says you are so ""technical"" they can't understand you, it means they just won't listen to a word you are saying. Next I had to try and explain why opening a document attached to an email and editing it didn't mean the sender could see the updates.",40,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF441280>
379,A favour for a family friend,"It's late 2019, SARS-CoV-2 was making minor headlines on page 15 as ""Wuhan Respiratory Syndrome"". Feels like a lifetime ago.

With that historicity in mind, we can visit another historicity. The first is the client, a family friend's mother. She's very roughly a local Betty White, she's older than most of the town and an absolute joy to talk to. I get buzzed into the sheltered housing facility by her son, who's retired himself.

Everything's quiet, the occasional whirr of an electric wheelchair, a faint smell of dogfood (someone did once explain that to me, but I've long since forgot) and, finally, ""Mother, this is the man I mentioned. He'll fix it all.""

If you ever deal with the geriatric, you will know two things:

1. Everything happened yesterday, recently, or just a few years ago, up to and including both world wars and the Apollo Programme
2. You're going nowhere without a story

I take the seat offered to me, and begin my ""So, what's the problem?""

In the style of the generation wiser than my own, she spoke to us both at the same time and in the same breath.

""A few years go, Gerry here bought me a computer to replace my electric typewriter. Didn't you Gerry? I love writing, stories, poems, accounts and it's so handy to have digital text files instead of binder after binder. Gerry helped me type in all the binders.""

""Over five thousand sheets.""

""It kept me busy. It's good to revisit your older work with fresh eyes. Now if you'd be a polite host and get our guest a nice drink, I'll show him what's bothering me.""

A tea later and I'm being shown error after error. Invalid page faults, general protection faults. The OS styling was old. Windows 98-ish or so, I thought. Then the big blue screen popped up, and kept popping up. At this point, we rebooted or got stuck in the cycle of ""Fatal Exception 0E"" - 0E is an invalid page fault. A page was referenced, but not found anywhere. Driver memory mapping, buggy software, Windows 9x being crap at memory management, etc.

I may have muttered ""Wow this is old"" and the son, Gerry, had said:

""It's more than a few years. Don't let the flat screen deceive you, that replaced the original old-TV style monitor. I bought it from Rumbelows in what must have been 1996 or so.""

Rumbelows had gone under in 1995 and hadn't ever turned a profit, but some stores continued trading in a new name, which was variously ignored by the customers as they continued selling the same thing.

""Okay"" I said ""Can I see the computer itself?"" You don't move an old person's furniture without asking. That's how you lose a hand or worse.

The PC was nestled between a curtain and the back of the bureau its I/O hardware adorned. The black and red logo practicing aposematism, ESCOM, stared back at me.

I was merely a callow youth when Escom crashed and burned, a friend's dad had an Escom Pentium 90 which played a Star Wars game we all loved. I'm now an entry-level greybeard and this machine pre-dated my career. The ""Intel Inside"" sticker was red, not blue.

I had a quick inventory of the hardware. PCI video card, S3 Trio based with empty PLCC sockets for more RAM, two dissimilar 72-pin SIMMs, so it had clearly been upgraded at some point. CPU was under a small black anodised aluminium heatsink with a little 40 mm fan on top of it. Socket 5 or Socket 7.

With enough determination, this was possibly repairable, but there was no way I could source enough parts to do fault finding on it. Probably bad RAM. Maybe a weakening PSU. I didn't care enough for something so old.

My theory was that it was bought with half the RAM it had, probably 4 MB, and upgraded. The motherboard had the memory bus at 32 bits, not the 64 bits later Pentiums used, so SIMMs didn't need to be in identical pairs.

The spec was probably sold with Windows 3.x or just DOS on it, then a Windows 95 upgrade later bore out the need for more RAM.

The old dear saw me poking around inside it and sat beside me.

""Is it just too old? I know a thing or two about being too old!""

Words are spoken very carefully. The computer had reached the end of its life, but these were not the correct words to use.

""As some of the parts get older they degrade, kind of wearing out. That's happened here. Ten, fifteen, years or so ago I might have had stock of some of them, or been able to get something in here working. This is a 1994 model, it's 25 years old. I don't have any parts and I can't get any.""

""Of course it is dear! Gerry bought it for my retirement a few years ago. What really concerns me are my files. Are they there?""

Plugging the HDD into a USB multi-port (SATA + 40 pin ATA + 44 pin ATA) and a mains to molex-4 for power got it up and running on my Windows 10 laptop. Which was entirely happy about the FAT16 400 MB HDD, showing it as a USB drive like any other. A tiny and glacially slow one, but a USB drive like any other.

The time an ancient HDD is most likely to fail is the time it's disturbed from its eternal resting place, so  I made copies, just in case.

All the files were there, meticulously ordered WordPerfect files. This was non-negotiable. The final state MUST include WordPerfect 7. You don't ask a 90 year old to learn something new when she's been doing the same thing, and meeting all her needs, for ""the last few years"", when those few years pre-date your entire career. Saying ""Why not try MS Word"" would have gone down like a bad case of coronavirus was about to.

So we replaced the machine with a NUC and a new monitor, because a corner CFL of the existing monitor had died.

WordPerfect 7 - which we had CDs for - does not work on Windows 10. Hell, it's debatable as to whether it worked on Windows 95. A quick search found people struggling to make it work on XP.

I phone a much more experienced greybeard.

""I have a problem. I need WordPerfect 7 working on something modern.""

""Let me let you into some history. MS Office changes its UI every so often for no identifiable reason. WordPerfect does not. Find a copy of WordPerfect Office X5 somewhere. The UI hasn't changed since the dawn of time. X5 worked at least in Vista, so you've a good chance of getting it going on ten. They did some changes in X6 which annoyed a lot of the old timers, that's a last resort.""

The requisite WordPerfect Office X5 was obtained, and loaded onto the NUC. It took some persuading to make it work, and maybe X6 or X7 would have been a better idea - WordPefect is very far outside my sphere of competency, but make it work I did.

I found a tool to migrate QuickCorrects from an old format to a new one, and copied over her custom keystrokes, but she interrupted me on that one.

""Oh young man, you've done enough for me. I know how to set up WordPerfect. I used it for years and years in the legal profession.""

Her fingers merrily danced over the keyboard, striking various ctrl and alt modifiers (and using the right ctrl key, a clear sign of a transcended power).

""Gerry! It's fixed! Look!"" She loads up an utterly professional Christmas events programme. ""I'll get it finished and to the printers in time!""

The joy on the matriarch's face was infectious, and within moments we were all laughing. They paid me about triple my usual rate, wouldn't listen to my protests.

""At her kind of age, happiness is all you have left"", explained Gerry. ""What's money if you're not happy?""",63,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF4412E0>
380,My stepdad accidentally killed an SSD,"Today, I gave to my little brother a shiny new NVME drive for his PC, because the existing drive in his PC holds about enough for one Windows install, Steam, and a handful of text adventures. I handed him the NVME drive and my stepdad, who is a pretty savvy computer user, happily accepts it and says he'll pop it in for him. Crucially, he seems a little confused about the form factor, but I assure him there should be a slot for it, and that it's an easy process. After all, he taught me things about computers when I was a kid, and my stepbrother's young, switched on and happening. This is in safe hands.

About an hour later, I get the call I was dreading. He says it won't boot.

Now, I'm somewhat skeptical about this, seeing as the BIOS wouldn't try to boot from an empty drive, but I don't have to ask, because he immediately clarifies with ""I put it in the cable and it's not working.""

Yes, folks. He put it in THAT cable.

I immediately realise that he has, in fact, plugged the NVME drive directly into a spare SATA power, and the boot failure was due to the power supply tripping. I then ask him to photograph the motherboard, so that I can identify the board and find where the M.2 slot should be. Sure enough, it's under the GPU, and after 15 minutes of surgery, he's got it back up and running.

 Except Windows doesn't recognise the drive. The BIOS doesn't recognise the drive. There is no drive to recognise. It's fried.

Thankfully, it wasn't that expensive, so I can get a replacement fairly easily, but yikes. RIP NVME drive, 2021-2022.",145,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF441340>
381,No one checked the basics...,"I had my own tech onsite support company for home and small business users for 15 years. Basically like the big blue store, before they went nationwide. I got a call from an older client who could not maintain a solid internet connection. It would go on and off repeatedly throughout the day. 

I always traveled with extra parts, network cards, power supplies, graphics cards, etc. She tells me she had the cable company out 2 of 3 times and they replaced the modem each time. She took it to a nearby shop that said it must be the hard drive and replaced the hd and reinstalled the OS.

Now, I always listen to previous things done, but also take the approach of... Start at the beginning, check the simple things, most likely to be the cause of the problem. 

Her network would go on/off every 30-45 secs. I checked her internet with my laptop and it was stable for much longer with good speed. After powering on her desktop and observing the network adapter in the control panel and device manager. I could see it (the network port) disappear and reinstall every 30-45 secs. From this I deduced network card could be failing or a bad slot in the MB (no onboard Ethernet).

Tried a new slot and a new card, same symptoms. I also suspected the power supply, but tried the other 2 things first. I installed a new power supply and her old network card. Power up and the problem was solved. Less than an hour (stayed for the full hour minimum to check her AV, bloatware, etc) and the cost of a new PS, she was good to go.

No one else had bothered to observe the actual problem and jumped to a conclusion and didn't even test to make sure their solution fixed the problem. I could forgive the cable tech, they usually don't and are told not to change out parts. 

The other company though, to just blindly replace the hard drive and reinstall the OS, and not run a full test after.

Neither tech had checked that it was fixed as it was a repeatable and short time frame for the problem to repeat.

Rule out the simple stuff that is also quickly checked, first.

Edit: I remembered (this was several years and thousands of tech calls ago), I also always carried a portable power supply tester. It measured voltage on each connection. This confirmed the power supply as the problem. That was also standard procedure and why I would always carry 1 or 2 ATX power supplies with me in my ""go kit"".",13,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF4413A0>

Fortunately we only support employees of client company, so most but not all of the caller are calm and collected. Some employees on that company use their personal computer and uses the company citrix portal.

Main Story:

The caller is a new hire of the client company and using her pesonal mac for work lets call her IL(ingrateful lady) and me as OP

OP: Hi thank you for calling \*\*\*\*\* service desk I am OPagent and can I have the following details

IL: sure no problem  


after verifying her details and confirming she is an employee of the company the probing starts

&#x200B;

IL: okay I am new hire and having trouble with the onboarding steps here.

OP: ok I help you on that, no problem. so what step are you having trouble with ?

IL: I don't know I haven't started with any of the steps yet.

OP: oh okay. then do you have the paper or pamphlet with the  instructions on it  
IL: Yes, I have it but I didn't open it yet.

\*from this point on I know I have a very long call

OP: okay then please open the instructions and I will guide you to the process.

IL: okay

\* so I assisted user in the following issues:

1. installing Citrix workspace since using a personal Mac
2. personally configured to open citrix apps using workspace
3. guided in registering an account for the citrix site
4. assisted user in resetting her password for the company account
5. taught how to log in to the citrix site
6. also taught on how to open the apps and direct her to her training (onboarding)

OP: ok seems to be ok now \[recapped on what happened on the call\], the is there anything else I can help before we disconnect

IL: yeah one more thing I have another monitor hooked up, can you make the Virtual desktop open/expand on both screens.

\* usually that is out of our scope since this is a personal computer and by policy we are not really allowed to control or make changes to the computer for safety and security

\*also note that up until that time I haven't touched or used a mac computer, I am a techy guy but used only windows, so the settings and versions for like new for me 

but since the call was already like an hour and my AHT(Average Handling Time) for that day is done for, might was try to do it. I was able to extend the other monitor but wasn't able to extend the vdi to the other screen, was able only to full screen on either monitor. I know how to use dual monitors cause using one during that time also with company vdi

So I apologized since unable to do it and tried to explain that since using a personal computer it may not be compatible to extend to dual monitors

IL: but my co-worker has the same setup as me and was able to do it and you can't ?

OP: then if you can, please contact her and and get the ticket no. so I can like replicate the steps he/she did.

IL: I don't have any contact with that co-worker. I just know we have the same setup and you guys was able to solve this issue

\*so from that statement she doesn't have proof of the resolution she JUST KNOWS it us who resolved it for her co-worker and refusing to call her co-work to either help me or self service her own problem

note this the line below is the exact words she used 

IL: we have been on this call for more than an hour and you did ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to help me, I mean nothing at all. why did I even bother to call you guys if you can't with anything. bye

\*hangs up\*

what's more infuriating is that during that call I heard no tone of happiness or appreciation even before saying her last issue. then she have the balls to  give a negative survey,",11,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF441400>
383,"""Why can't I install the app on my computer ?""","Short back ground story:

I was working at a large BPO-IT service desk company for 4 years. During that 4 years we were a voice account, meaning we get calls to troubleshoot and as mush as possible to resolve the issue on the call, we can also remote in to the computer if need be. This happened before the pandemic of covid-19

Fortunately we only support employees of client company, so most of the caller are calm and collected. The company is considerate and also employs senior citizens and usually works at home, and depends on their role/job they will be using either personal or company provided computer. If using a personal computer their is logging in to their citrix site.

Main story:

The caller is a nice old lady, as old people go that they are very ignorant around computers and I am very understanding about that. The caller is a new hire and was (don't know why the company does this) sent onboarding steps for new joiner but no instructions on how to set up the required apps to the computer to open citrix apps and was advised to call IT service desk, which is us.

As I was handling the call and asking questions to isolate the issue to help her properly. Unfortunately since she was very illiterate about computers was unable to answer most on my questions or probing, the only thing I got was she was using a personal computer. So the last choice I had is remote in to personally see by RDA on what is the issue.

I was shocked when I was finally was able to remote in, just to remind you this happened  before covid hit, so this was around late 2019. Her computer is very old, she said on earlier the computer as old but I didn't expect this old, I expected she was using like win 7 or vista. The computer was running Win 95 and for citrix the computer needed the application Citrix receiver/workspace to open app from the site. I asked one of the support team(which I was familiar and friends with) on what is the lowest or minimum OS for the cirtix workspace, they said the lowest should be win 7(any version). He was shocked and laughed when I said the caller is still using Win 95,

After the shock and inquiry from the support team I was composing in my mind on what to say to her to not irate or insult her. So I explained in a very basic way on why the citrix receiver will not install and advised to reach out to like her son/daughter or her neighbor on helping her upgrade her to a more modern computer, so she can work on it.

note:

I was very lucky the lady was very nice and understanding. Please don't judge me  too harshly on this cause I am from a Philippines and so far the oldest OS I know on a personal computer  is Win 7 and those were not gamers or not have much income, so I never expected someone is still using Win 95.",82,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF441460>
384,My son is a programmer,"I was asked to lob this tale over to here.

 

My kids wanted me to start sharing some of my stories from some of my old jobs on this Reddit page. Here is the background, 2003 I graduated from college with a BS degree in Telecom/Network Management. So …. I know a little bit about networking, computers, and other things in the computer world to be dangerous or helpful depending on the day. After graduating from college, the Computer/Networking job market all but dried up for a while. I had to take temp jobs where I can get them. Till I finally landed a field tech job, working as a full-time employee. I worked on, current at that time, major computer companies’ desktops, laptops, and servers. I had to get an A+, and each computer companies’ certification for all their system, so I can fix them. This means in about 2 months I knew a few things more on hardware and software on the computer system and Micro... well you know. While working at this company I became good at my job. I mean really good; I was number 2 Field Tech in the whole company in United State and number 1 in the Midwest.

Here is where my story begins, I was getting started with my workday. Going through all of the scheduled jobs for the day, finding delivered parts for each ticket. When my manager called me into his office. I walked into his office thinking I might have done something wrong. Nope, it was a phone meeting with one of the clients talking about the customer that has been giving them problems, they have sent her a two-replacement desktop and still, she is having issues getting on to the internet. She is blaming the computer and the provider because this all worked before, she had to get a new computer and DSL line, and she was wanting her dial-up and old computer back but is stuck with the new stuff. Back in this time DSL (Before cable modems) was still a big thing and dial-up is all but dead. (RIP Dial-up, you had served us well.) I agreed to do this since I know computers and network, and the client was happy with my work, and wanted me to do this call for them. When it was done, they wanted a full report on what I did to fix the problem or not fix the problem. 

The meeting was done and my manager had me follow him to grab the parts that they sent to get this issue resolved. I was thinking maybe a motherboard, RAM, and networking card. Nope, I got a motherboard, power supply, processor chip, RAM, extended video card, cooling fan, networking card, Hard drive, floppy drive, CD ROM drive, and CDs to install an Operating System and drivers. Minus the desktop case I have a complete computer. 

Now the fun part, I had to inventory all of the parts, and then I decided to call the customer, que scarry music here. 

 From now on the customer shall be named Karen. The following conversation of what she said, I might be missing or adding something, it was a long time ago, but this was the jest of it. Me calling Karen:

Karen: Hello

Me: Good morning my name OP, I am with you, insert the client company’s name here. I have a ticket here to fix your...

Karen: About, gosh darn time!

(Sorry trying to be clean for the kids, it wasn’t gosh darn. It was more an f sounding word and another D-word.)

Me: Kindly replying, ...yes... I see here you want me there this afternoon...

Karen: NO! I said I would like you to hear after 1 pm. I have other appointments I have to take care of, my time is important!

Me: Again, slowly forming words to be kind and polite. OK, I will set up a time about 1:30 pm today at, insert Karen’s address. I will call you before I head to your house, and when I am close to your home. 

Karen: Better get this fixed, none of you so call techs have gotten it right so far. \*Hangs up\*

OH JOY! This is going to be a fun afternoon. Now one of my best skills is being able to put up with customers of all kinds. I believe in killing them with kindness, and imagining them being squashed by a boulder, anvil, falling plain, WWII bomb, hit by a train, and much more cartoony violence... Mother raised me on Looney Toons if you can tell. But I will never be mean to the customer, so I thought, there is a limit to a person's niceness. 

Me 20 minutes about to leave to Customer’s house. Get an answering machine. “Hello this is Op, I am about to leave to head to your home, insert Karen’s address. So, I am about 3 blocks from her house, it is about 5 min to 1:30, and I call her again. Karen answer:

Karen: Where are you! You are going to be late. I was going to call your company to ask where you are at. I’ve been waiting all day.

(People, I’m not even late. I called her made the appointment time, then called her to let her know I was on my way.)

Me: Calmly, and nicely... I left you a message on your answering machine about 20 min ago saying that I was on my way, and now I am letting you am about to pull into your driveway. 

Karen: Fine! Just get in here and fix this darn thing, also the phone company is here working on the DSL maybe between you two I might get something working. I doubt it.

Me: OK, I just parked my car and gathering my stuff now. Goodbye \*Hang up\* 

Can I mention here that she was all sorts of fun, she cursed like a sailor, acted like she was top dog, and looked down on me like I was scum and she smelled like she can brew her own liquor from her breath. Again, OH JOY!!!!! She begins to tell me how her son “the programmer” said she needed in order to keep up with the current time on the internet, because she was hosting a heart and gin card game site, and talking on other forums and how her old computer couldn’t handle it. She ended up getting her Entryway. (It is not the real name of the computer or Company. You might know who I am talking about. All hail the black and white cow of technology!)

As walked into her office I see the two computers that were sent before, that didn’t work next to the wall by the door covered in dust. I asked why she had not sent them back to the company, and that your honor, is where I took the wrong turn from sanity lane and ended in crazy Ville. 

Karen: I know their game, they send me a broken computer, I call and complain that it is broken, they tell me, they are going to send me a new one but they want me to send them back the old one first, and that is when the close-up shop take my money and I am left high and dry! No money and no Computer, plus I am not going to spend my money on shipping those pieces of crap.

And that my friends, is when I decided to step out to my car...because I forgot; wink, wink; my special tool to help check the computer internet processing. (There is no real tool like that, ha ha. My battle for this moment was RUN AWAY, RUN AWAY!) I went out there to call my manager to confirm all this. He confirmed that she is indeed holding those desktops for ransom till her she gets a working one. At this point, I should break this down to you. 

1. The company always sends the new PC to them first.
2. The box that they send the replacement computer to comes with a shipping label for you to ship back the broken one, so you never have to pay for shipping.
3. They had, at that time, a good reputation, plus they were all over TV, Billboard, and Radio. 
4. There was no way they were going to steal her money and close up shop.

I go back in and I said I forgot the tool, but I think I still fix the issue. I look at the telecom guys and they gave me a look. GET OUT, GET OUT NOW while you still can. These poor guys, one was at one side of the house where the DSL came in the other was in the room with me checking the line coming in and they are finding nothing. Karen is telling them they cannot leave till this is sorted out and she has talked to their manager and is staying. So, there I was in the house of insanity, I had no choice but to go in and look at this beast. (I mean the computer, not Karen. I was thinking it though) I stepped up to the computer, one of the Telecom guys is watching me. It boots to the desktop screen; I look and sure enough no connection. I check the back where your plugin for the network and there are no lights flashing for internet connectivity. HMM... I then go into settings to network and dial-up connection and there, boys and girls, I see it. LAN not showing any connection as though it was turned off. First thought this can't be right, this should be like this right clicked and there was my answer. I asked Karen “When you got this computer did you do anything to the setting?”

Karen: NO! I don’t know anything about those things?

Me: Did your son help you set this up?

Karen: No! he lives in another town and is 2 hours from here.

(Why am I not surprised)

Me: Well, I found the problem then, the LAN has been disabled.

To tell the people who don’t know if you disable the LAN on your computer, you are basically stopping your computer from accessing the network/internet. The only way of doing this is by going into the setting to the network folder right-click on LAN and click disable. I now know something is up. 

Here is where the real, real, real fun begins. The Telecom guys upon hearing this asked me if I  was sure. I had him come over and showed him. I right-click and re-enabled the LAN and BEHOLD, like the clouds parting the sky to show the sun, I give you the internet. That is when Karen started to yell at me.

Karen: You are a stupid person; you don’t know what you are talking about! Since I have DSL, I don’t need the LAN. My son, the programmer, told me so, he went to college and has a degree. You should be ashamed of yourself, not knowing this stuff works.

That was when I turned down my nice polite self and told her the following.

Listen here, I have a degree in Networking, several certifications that YOUR son, “the programmer,” does not have. (I should have asked why she kept telling me her son was a programmer? ) I have pride in what I do, I am one of the best in my company, this is why I am here. Now you are fixed, these two guys are going to join me and leave. The telecom guys told me they couldn’t yet. Since she wasted their time, and the problem was not on their end, they were authorized to charge her for the time they worked on the DSL line. I was told they have been coming here back and forth for two days, a total of 10 hours. I know that is not cheap, several thousands of dollars if I remember right. She is going to be charged for their time. Her face went white and started to studdered a little. 

Do you think this was the end...NOPE! We have not yet heard the cry of the wild of Karen. “I WANT TO TALK TO YOUR MANAGER!” .... Boys and Girls, I got the wild Karen cry. As soon as I got both desktops packed up ready to leave the house and to my car. Karen cries out to me; “I’m going to call your manager, and tell him how you didn’t help me. That you don’t know what you are doing and how my son knows more than you do.”

I looked straight at her gave her my company card, with the client’s number in the back, and said go ahead. I’m about to do a full report on this and let them know that you or your son “The Programmer” disabled the network connection and that is why the other two computers don’t work. Better yet how about I call them to set up a conference call with them right now, then I boot up the other two computers up and see if their network connection has been disabled as well. Then make a recommendation that they cancel any support for you since you have such a savvy son who fixes all of your computer need. Any which way I am done with this call and I am going to go home for the rest of the day. Before I left, I talk to the two Telecom techs gave them my number if their manager had any questions about what I have done. 

When I called the client and explained what I found, what she said, that they were going to scammer her out of her money and close up shop, and how she insulted all of us because her son “the programmer” knew more than us. They happily called her to inform her that her warranty is valid but they will not be sending any more desktop or onsite techs. Any and all issues will have to be shipped to them and they will get to it in the order in which it was received. In the tech department terms, this means: We will get to it when we want to and anything else that comes up no matter what it is will push you to repair to the back of the line till close to shipping backdate if you are lucky. 

I told my manager about this the next day, he just shook his head, said if she calls, he will get back to her in the order of the call was received.... maybe. Never did hear back from her. The other techs in the office heard about the ticket and every once in a while, I will get a call from them asking me since they have DSL should they disable the LAN?",133,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF4414C0>
385,A career in IT,"In the not so long ago, I left a very comfortable job, that while comfortable, was at a dead end, I was a desktop guy, and I was never going to get off the desktop team, and off of On Call. Ever. On Call was 3 weeks on, 7 weeks off. I was some kind of hybrid desktop/Junior sys admin type guy. I was spec’ing out enterprise hardware and then building images for them, Laptops, Desktops, All in One Machines, with 13 diff total images, plus automating out Bulk password resets, account type maintenance AD stuff /w powershell 

So in the age before the Great Resignation, before the Vid, I dolled up my resume and I went looking for greener pastures, and I found it. First sys admin Title bump, Pay bump, no on Call. Happily Ever After, or so I had thought

In hindsight my entire interview process was one giant series of Red Flag, after I applied online, they emailed me and wanted me to interview the next day, I actually called in Sick to work to go that interview, after I interviewed at 11, they called me back by 1 with an offer, paperwork by 4. Signed sealed delivered. They told me that they were rushed this because the CIO and Infrastructure manager were both going on Vacation on in 7 weeks and they needed me to backfill both positions. They wanted me to give one weeks notice, but because of the On Call situation at my previous gig, I wasn’t going to go out like that. I gave 3 weeks notice, and enjoyed saying goodbye to a great gig, but onward to greener pastures!

Even though its is spring, the greener pastures are not green. I had 3 weeks to crash course the infrastructure environment to backfill the Infrastructure manager before he went on Vacation to a place where he would not be available to even answer txt messages if I had an emergency to reach him. So, Citrix, backups, AV, Cloud, Exchange, patching,  the general environment, the whole shebang. And I did it, Then the CIO takes off the week after and I have to become the Telecom/Network guy (I am not a telecom/Network guy) So I have to crash course that in the next week, and I do that also, nothing broke and I didn’t have an epic chance for glory or failure, but I was stuff daily without a safety net and I wasn’t messing anything up 

Both the CIO and the Infrastructure come back and begin the most toxic, most browbeating, micromanaging environment to come into play. I’ve been there 1 month, and I need to make another 2 Months before I pass probation (Am Canadian) 2.5 Months for EI and I have some type of employee protection in place

IT up to this point had always been a fairly collaborative place for me, where idea’s get thrashed out on their merits and the strongest/most practical/ securest is adopted. So, I need to get a windows 10 rollout off the ground, But they’ve purchased 500 Dell Micro’s spec’d /w 4 gigs of RAM, i5s and have been modified to have a VGA port added at the factory, like why have we decided to do this? (OS, Sophos, outlook and chrome will eat >4 gigs, like these machines should be usable) Well I’m told I don’t know anything about hardware. Even though these guy hired me on among things I’ve done,  running a Capital Refresh Project where I upgraded almost a million dollars worth of equipment, equipment that I spec’d off of business uses btw

The CIO and the infrastructure manager, are some of the technically weak, sensitive about it, Techs I’ve ever come across. After that encounter, I stop volunteering my opinions, but it gets so much worse
 
I turn down their company iphone 6 for my pixel 2, because my pixel is better. I’m not on call, I don’t need a phone, I can check my emails on my phone, this shouldn’t be a deal at all, I don’t need a company phone. Well, that escalated to I have to take this company phone, and because the Pixel is not something that the company offers, should a user see my pixel, they will request one. Therefore, that iphone was to become my primary device, that I had to transfer my sim card into, without any kind of financial compensation. Even though I am not in a customer facing role, and I am again, not on call. 

Then, even though again. Not on call, I am “to be available” After hours should some sort of need arise. Again without any kind of compensation, which is illegal. But, if I push back, there just going to fire me, because I’m inside the probationary period, and have no rights. So they send me a txt after hours that I ignore because I’m out living my life. That I get chewed out about, because I’m “Not reliable”. However when a core switch fails and I have to map the existing data connections physically from the core switch to the non virtual servers, remove/replace the switch and restore the backup to it. I can do that. I’m reliable for that.

If I have a question about anything, I am not to take notes. However, once I am given the answer, I should somehow be required to retain all of this info, and I shouldn’t ask again for confirmation/clarification or ask that they just double check my work, because they’ve already told me. But, may the God of IT help me if I make a mistake/oversight such as a capitalization error on a SMTP email address. That’s a browbeating

I commit the unforgivable sin of composing internal e-mail communications with a “Hey” instead oh “Hi or Hello” and this is so embarrassing to my CIO, that going forward all of my email correspondence is now to be reviewed/approved. I am told that should I ever get a phone call I am to answer the phone going forward (my desk phone btw, that I don’t get phone calls on, with my  non user facing role) with “Good Morning/Afternoon, Islandlucky speaking, how may I help you?” 

I get a different after hour email another time from the infrastructure manager this time, while I’m out a living my life, again not on call. And again I don’t respond to it. Well, I get hauled into a meeting with the CIO and Infrastructure Manager, where again, not too takes notes, they tell me that again they tell me that “I’m not Dependable”  and that they “Don’t think you have a Career in IT” (which is the most toxic thing anyone has said to me to date. I have Microsoft certifications and 10 years of experience in this field. I’ve worked my way up from L1 Helpdesk)That afternoon they change my title/roll to L2 Helpdesk and they have want me to work with a DBA now about SQL Database upgardes/migrations (Again, not a DBA Guys, and also, if I’m not dependable, don’t make me run around database stuff)

And for the record, the infrastructure manager is Terrible, he scheduled a reboot once in the middle of the night that interrupted a dot net framework patch that had to be removed/re added to use a critical piece of billing software that had to be updated on Each Machine. But, lets look at Islandlucy’s emails to see if I used the proper Salutation. Oops messed up the Exchange server, no body’s getting any emails for a morning, 

It’s the summer now, I’ve reached out to recruiters to get me the hell out of this place, and I’m responding to any jobs that I’m most of the way qualified for just trying to get away from this place. But the IT Gods are making me suffer and the starts haven’t aligned, The day before my probationary period expires, 15 days before I qualify for Employment Insurance. They let me go. They replace me with 2 helpdesk positions to rollout the win 10 image I’ve made on the MDT server I’ve setup. 

A couple months later, one night I start getting SMS alerts sent to my SIM Card, back home in the pixel 2 where it belongs. The SMS alerts are from a server closet at that gig. But, I shouldn’t be getting these alerts as I am First of all, no longer at that company, and Secound of all, I *NEVER WAS ON ON CALL*

Been a couple years since then, When that summer ended, I got a different sys admin gig, I’ve been flipping from gig to get looking for my forever job (I’m up 20k from that nightmare job, same title, better benefits, if you aren’t happy at your current gigs my dudes, you should dust off the old resume and see whats out there) 

This morning, I’ve had some time on my hands, its quiet at the office, didn’t get to take any time off around the holidays, and I look that Company’s Linkedin up, to see whos still there. And lo and behold. Besides the fact that I still hate those idiots and I’m still salty about. They’re both not there anymore. The infrastructure Manager got retired early and the CIO himself got fired 18 months ago. And hasn’t found another gig yet. Looks like I wasn’t the only on that Didn’t have a career in IT.",17,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF441520>
386,Predecessor?! - Part 2: The introduction,"[Part 1: The hiring](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/rrfoie/predecessor_part_1_the_hiring/)

&#x200B;

So after what took place in part 1, we actually had a full day's worth of work ahead of us. It turned out that my predecessor was fired about 2 days before my 1st day. Usually that person would still be around to teach the new one, because our contracts in the holding say that you are still employed for the rest of the current month + 3 more months. So even if you substract his potentially remaining vacation days and overtime, he should still be around....unless the employer basically says that you don't need to show up while still paying you, which was the case here.

&#x200B;

Normally your first day pretty much ends after some introductions, getting your equipment, a tour through the all the halls, and you get shown where your office/cubicle is going to be. Not quite the case here. $boss and $external (the one from phone-call #2 in Part 1) were present. We were sitting in a conference room and they showed me a lot of information, pictures regarding the network, while I was setting up my equipment, as apparently my predecessor just factory-resetted the cell phone and laptop. Upon finishing the installation of the cell phone, it starts ringing.

&#x200B;

I saw that it was a cell phone number and just handed over the phone to $boss, as I felt like something was off here. $boss picked it up and talked for a bit.

>$Me: ""My laptop seems to be ready now. What's the wifi-password?""  
>  
>*$Me (in my head): ""Good save, dude! Good save!""*

We proceeded to finish up setting up the laptop and joining the domain. After going through every VM at my sites, more administrative preparations and of course more pictures to look at, we set out to go through the halls, so I can introduce myself. What followed was going through a maze of halls in 4 different buildings at the main site, entering each office and repeating the same introduction over and over again. After about the 3rd stop it became really hard to keep a genuine smile on my face while feeling like a broken record-player stuck on the same loop for at least another 50 stops.

The reaction I received varied. Some seemed enthusiastic to see a new face. Some were surprised and asked what happened with $predecessor....very awkward. Others just didn't seem like they cared and the last group seemed mad because they liked $predecessor. I mean they said it out loud like ""Oh no, I actually liked $predecessor!"".

The first day ended with us visiting the other 3 sites and repeating the introduction-loop. On day 2 we looked for all the places in the production halls where the switches are located, and I got introduced how the Ticket System works and where to find some documentation about my local network and global network. That's it. At the end of day 2 both left and on from there on I was on my own. So I had to learn how things work on the fly, as what we went through was nowhere near enough with a network of this size, and with hardware/software I haven't used before...which I was supposed to set up at one of the other sites the week after.

So on day 3 I sat down in my office and tried to come up with a plan. The server room and all (I don't know how to call those...rooms with no servers in them, but patch panels and switches) were a mess. Cable-management from hell, the ground is covered in boxes filled with random stuff that you can barely set foot into the rooms. I still didn't really know where to look if someone came to me with a problem that didn't just require a < 1-minute fix. After some thinking I decided I'd try to socialize with the others on site as fast as possible and find out (or at least get a feel) what transpired in the past with $predecessor. Because this would determine whether I would like to stay with the company or not. While socializing asking them if they have any issues/wishes I can help with. Colleagues who were older than me generally were pretty tight-lipped, but those around my age and younger were eager to share some information about $predecessor.

&#x200B;

My reaction to those stories varied from *WTF?!* to laughing maniacally. Since those stories were verified by multiple other colleagues, I was ruling out that some people could have been ""just salty"".

\#4: Rank means nothing if your ego is big enough

Some colleagues told me that he would repeatedly have arguments with $CIO. Disagreeing and defying his orders. And the reason he would do it is because he supposedly knew better than the rest. From what I can tell today his knowledge was somewhat higher than an average intern. Problems that I've solved since, that he deemed impossible to solve and told the colleagues to ""live with it"", were so easy to solve. And he supposedly tried for hours on some of them. I hadn't encountered all of those problems in the past, but after 20 secs of googling I found the answer to why in one case a person couldn't print mails from Outlook. I mean it is the first hit when you google ""can't print email from outlook"". I still cannot wrap my head around to why he had his job for 3 years and what he thought the consequences would be just flat out defying one of the top people in the whole multi-billion holding.

&#x200B;

\#5: Mirror mirror on the wall

For whatever reasons $predecessor left a letter from the police in his office. It was a speeding ticket, doing 160+ km/h (\~100 mph) where 120 km/h (\~75 mph) were allowed. So I finally saw a picture of him. Needless to say bad quality, but I thought I could use that to start off a conversation with a colleague.

\#6: No caption, just my favourite one

$predecessor asks $external what to do in order to get 4th production site connected with the data center.  So $predecessor has all the hardware needed (firewalls and switches) and this dates back to the point where 4th production site was just acquired and had to be set up. Besides a server cabinet the server room was empty in regards to ""furniture"".

>$predecessor: ""So how do I need to configure the firewalls?""  
>  
>$external: *Gives long explanation*  
>  
>$external: ""Any questions?""

>$predecessor: ""No.""

He connects to $predecessor's Laptop and starts checking the settings of the routers, firewalls and switches.

>$external: ""Well of course nothing is working. You haven't done anything that I told you to do. If you configure it like I said, it will work.""

Radio silence....

No words spoken....

Cursor is not moving....

Several minutes actually pass....

>$external: ""Do I need to repeat what I said days ago or when are you going to start doing the changes needed?""  
>  
>$predecessor: ""That was your stupid idea, so you do the changes! Why should I do what you said? You get paid a lot, now do something for that money! And I wont do anything in here until I get an table and a chair in here. Those are unacceptable working conditions in here!""

$external gave up and implemented those changes. Since then I've been to that server room. Still no table or chairs. Between us this has become one of the running gags whenever I have to go to that server room. No table and/or no chair = no work! The darn room next to it has both and you have a 5m cable then you can even sit at a table and do the work, if you keep the door open.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

There are several stories more, but I cannot remember all of them completely. This should be enough though to get the message across why $predecessor had to go. To this day I get several calls from places where he registered his company cell phone. I got text messages when his COVID-shot appointments were coming up, when he booked hotels, other doctor appointment reminders etc. He clearly didn't use it as he was supposed to.

So they needed to get rid of him and knew he wouldn't take it kindly nor would he teach me during our time together. So why lie about it? Two reasons. One is that would weaken their position during $$$ discussions. The other one is that if I happened to know someone in that company, I could tell them and they could tell so on and so on, until it might have reached $predecessor.

But why not openly say so during the first day(s)? I mentioned it in the comments of part 1. $boss didn't know how to say it. He comes across as very shy and unconfrontational. He probably wouldn't have known how to react if I had become somewhat aggressive with my attitude upon hearing his explanation.

All in all they got a pass from me and I'm still there. The reason why I thought about writing about $predecessor was my most recent find the server room that I finally managed to clean up a bit. Hidden under several layers of other boxes, I find the treasure. A box full with about 100-200 Commodore 64 disks. You know...the ~~big~~ medium ones, not the 3.5'' (Edit: Got corrected in the comment section. Didn't know 8'' disks existed). According to the texts on them, they date back to the year I was born in the early 80s. Coincidentally I actually still possess a Commodore 64 and as tempted as I was to take a peek, I settled with calling my IT-colleagues in HQ with my camera on and presenting them the gem. What if you could put all those disks in a big RAID? Would you get a whooping 2 MB of space? We will never know!

&#x200B;

This concludes the saga about $predecessor. Other stories I have in mind have to wait because of legal reasons (for probably another year). I hope you guys enjoyed and happy new year!",47,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF441580>
387,". . . But it's my SQL cluster, where are my backups?!?!?!","Back around 10 years ago, I worked for a lovely Managed Hosting company in their Backup department.  One of the amenities you received when leasing a server from us was a complimentary backup service with a 14 day data retention.  You were notified of this service and all the details surrounding it in a ticket which required a customer response in order to close.

Obviously, these were generic backups, and the ticket informed you what data was covered, as well as the fact that you could change what data was being backed up, when it was backed up, and how long your data was retained (retention time was the only real cost increase).


RT: Me

MCMI: Minor customer with major idiocy

AM: Account Manager for MCMI

A bit of background:

The customer has 4 servers with us. 3 are application servers with a massively and unnecessarily convoluted system resembling a Celtic knot.  The 4th has a custom application that houses their critical database which is referenced by all three app servers, with backups done automatically and dumped to the D drive in a specific directory.

Cue account creation and database server being spun up. Autogenerated ticket detailing backups is sent to MCMI.

MCMI responds to said ticket: ""Reconfigure backup to back up *ONLY* D:/db_backups.  REPEAT!!!  ONLY D:/db_backups.""

Admin handling the request configures backups per customer request, updates ticket with the changes and closes it.

Fast forward 6 years. 

Phone rings on a Friday afternoon. Middle of my work day as I work the midshift.

RT: ""Hello, thank you for calling Company, this is rax_tempus, how may I help you today?""

MCMI: ""Yes, I need some data restored to my db server.""

RT: ""Absolutely, just let me get you verified real quick!""

Verification process proceeds smoothly. Too smoothly. I should have known this was going be a SNAFU.

RT: ""Alright, MCMI, apologies for that delay, let's get your issue resolved. I will be creating ticket #blah for this request, can you provide the path of the data you require and the date it was backed up?""

MCMI: ""Yeah, I need my MS SQL backups from (date over 3 years ago).

RT: checks device    "". . . ""

RT: ""I'm sorry sir, but having checked the backup config on that device I'm showing that you only have a 14 day data retention.  Furthermore, you don't have the MS SQL backup agent installed. We are only backing up your flat file dumps in D:/db_backups.""

I quickly pull the configs for all 4 servers on this account as I inform him of this, seeing two have no backups at all while the 3rd has only default backups.  

MCMI: ""Uuuhhhh, fucking what? This better be some stupid joke. FIND MY BACKUPS!!!!""

I begin pulling ticket histories for the DB server as he continues to impugn my honor and competence.  Easy enough because there are literally only 20 in the device history, all for low disk space except for the auto generated tickets from server spin up and one All Services Lost Connection ticket 4 years ago.

RT: ""Sir, I have searched every ticket this device has ever generated, and there is only one that mentions backups in any way, and it's the one where YOU specifically tell us the only directory to be backed up. MS SQL is never even mentioned because this was a custom job.""

MCMI: ""Yeah, but four years ago we remade our entire environment! I need that data or one of our clients will sue us, so get your ass in gear and FIND MY BACKUPS!""

RT: "". . . sir, did you inform anyone here at Company of this? Like, say, your account manager?""

MCMI: ""Of course I did, moron. This is on your crap service!""

I pull every ticket the entire damned account has ever generated and speed skim through all 150ish of them. No mention of these massive changes.  But wait, there was that one ticket four years ago for all services lost connection . . . 

I bring that ticket back up, and the dates match up with their environment rebuild. The ticket was closed without comment by . . . yup. None other than MCMI.  Literally no other sign anything major had happened to any of their servers.  

I place MCMI on hold and call up the account manager.

RT: ""Hey AM, sorry to bother after hours, but I have MCMI from Idiot Inc on the line.""

The immediate sigh of resignation tells me all I need to know.  I explain the situation, and AM confirms: nary so much as a peep from Idiot Inc regarding a rebuild of their environment.

RT:""Hello, MCMI? I just spoke with AM, and she, along with your ticket history, confirms that Company was never informed of these changes. I'm afraid there's nothing further I can do to assist, so I will be closing out this ticket. I will, however, be creating ticket #blah to detail your need for the MS SQL backup agent we provide and will be escalating it directly to AM to follow up with you. Thank you and have a great day!""

I say this all at a speed that would have gotten appreciative cheers from a gaggle of auctioneers.

MCMI: ""FU-""click as I hang terminate the call.

My direct supervisor, who sits five feet away, sighs and asks for the account number, so he can get ready for the coming complaint call.

Ten minutes later, MCMI calls in and is transferred directly to my supervisor who ends up terminating the call after 45 seconds because MCMI won't stop screaming obscenities.

The next day AM has terminated the account with notes that if MCMI calls in that he is to be transferred to Legal immediately.

388,Saved a perfectly good printer from ID10T recylcing,"This happened a few months ago.  

Background.  I work for an MSP, and was onsite doing cleanup work after a switch replacement over the weekend.  I was just about to leave when one of my co-workers asked me to look at a printer issue they had been troubleshooting for the past few days.  They needed verification that the printer was completely dead so they could order a new one (they had spent at least 4 collective hours troubleshooting the printer remotely).  

So I mosey on over to the printer and ask the users to show me what's happening.  They send the print job, nothing prints out.  I look at the printer after the test print is sent, and it's waiting for a paper tray verification.  I hit ""OK"" to specify the paper size, then at least 50 documents start printing out!  The users are ecstatic, singing my praises as the savior of printers.  Notified my colleagues and they all had a good laugh, and they cancel the quote for the new printer they were about to order.",52,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF441640>
389,I didn't read past the first sentence of your reply so maybe you didn't understand and I should ask again.,"I got an email from one of our regional technicians.  He wanted to know how many pins a particular sensor was supposed to have.  It's an understandable question since it looks like one of the pins is missing.  

I replied that the sensor only used 3 wires and only needed 3 pins.  The 4th pin on the sensor is cut off at the factory because it doesn't do anything.  

I then get a reply 5 minutes later with a photo of the sensor asking me if the 4th pin was supposed to have been cut off.  

I did a ctrl+C ctrl+V of the relevant sentence I just sent and was rewarded with a cheerful reply thanking me.  

That will teach me to answere questions while on vacation.  I only answered because I had nothing better to do while I waited for dinner to finish cooking and this one looked like a fish in a barrel.",89,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF4416A0>
390,How I didn't catch a thief,"English is not my first language so feel free to ignore any errors, also this story is about 25 years old so I enhanced the forgotten details accordingly.  

Context: So I was in IT support for a government-related organisation and they are about to upgrade all desktop computers to Windows NT 4.0 workstation which was recently released, or about to be released. I was sent into the building with a box full of memory strips and instructed to make sure all desktop computers were equipped with a certain amount of RAM (my memory says 64 MB). As luck would have it they were highly standardised so all computers were of the same series and they had plenty of memory slots.  

I did ask whether I would need to make an inventory of what went where but I was assured that their asset management system would keep track of everything. Oh boy, it did keep track of everything, it was way advanced for the 1990s. At the end of the day my manager showed me their logs and it showed exactly which serial number memory strip ended up in which slot on which desktop PC. They were quite happy that I had thought of reusing as much as I could as the memory was really expensive back then. It took me a few days and all users were happy to get some extra coffee break while I upgraded their computers.  

On to the story itself which happened a few days after the upgrades. HDM: yours truly. FDM: Friendly Department Manager. CMU: Clueless Malicious User.  

FDM: HappyDutchMan, can you please go over to CMU and check their workstation as our system shows that half of their memory is missing as of yesterday lunch time.  

I go over to see CMU and the conversation goes about as follows:  

HDM: Hi CMU, remember me from a few days ago when I upgraded your memory?  

They immediately turn red and can only stutter now, never seen this person stutter before.  

CMU: Yyyess... ??  

HDM: Well, there seems to be an issue with your memory, our system reports that half of it is missing. This could of course be an error on our end so I am checking with you if you have noticed anything strange such as slow performance.  

CMU (Gasping for air and staring at me wide-eyed):  Nonono ... nonono no no I I I I don't know.... No no I didn't notice anything strange. No no no no... Why d d d do you ask?  

HDM Trying not to laugh: Well okay. No worries, it probably is something on our end then. If you do notice any problems just let us know, alright?  

CMU (Calming down a wee bit but still super alert and breathing heavily): Yyyess ... sure ... I will do.  

I go back to our control room and explain what happened to FDM. We have a good laugh. We don't have any camera's or anything so proving that CMU has stolen the memory would need police investigation at their place and so on.  

The next morning we check the asset management system and to our joy, the memory of this user is all back in place. They did change the order of the memory strips but this didn't matter. End of the story is that CMU probably shat their pants and had a rough night as they were one of the first people in the office the second day.",46,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF441700>
391,How I busted a devious scheme,"So, people seem to like to hear about my work with POS (yes it means both Point of sale and the other you're thinking about)
So here's another story. Once again it have been quite a few years since this happened, so the details are a bit iffy. I will just throw in some dramatization to fill out those gaps in my memory. 

Background, for those of you that didnt read the last post, I worked for a outsourced IT servicedesk and we were serving one of the bigger retail companies in our country. Because of that, we were handling the technical side of their cashier machines, hencefort known as POS, and its peripherals. 
At this point I've worked here for abit under a year and have done quite well for myself. 

One day I recieved a ticket, not through the normal queue. My teamleader came to me and needed me to take care of something. 
The IT director of the retail company had reached out to our company for some help going through some logs. 

IT director of Retail Company: DRC |
Store manager of this one store: SM |
Detective OP: OP |

(piecing together some emails/information/ticket text to make it into a conversation, not actual conversation) 
DRC: Hi, we need your help but we need you to be super descreet about it. You need to look through some logs for the past 2 weeks for all the transactions at store X. SM here will assist if you need anything. 

OP: Hi, hello, sure thing! But what exactly am I looking for? Could you please describe the problem? 

DRC: Remember, descretion is key. We don't want anyone finding out before we know more. 

OP: Yes ofcourse, so what the issue? 

SM: Someone is stealing from the store. I've seen some discrepencies in the POS and our results. We need to find out which POS and when it could have occured to catch the theif. 

DRC: We don't know if theres a theif yet, but yes we need you to look through the logs to see if its a technical error or if theres actually money missing. 

(background, we usually dont handle the money side of their troubles, but we do how ever handle the transactions to the cardcompany. Its the SM's job to look up discrepencies but they usually pawn it off to us cause some reason. Usually its some 10's of dollars ""missing"" due to technical errors with double registration or w/e) 

So I pull out all the info from the POS and transactions for the store at the given dates and start looking through the numbers. And what do I find, about $2.000 of discrepencies (I dont actually remember the number, it was enough to raise an eyebrow). 
So I dug deeper and after hours (was probably 2 minutes) of looking I find a pattern. Every other or third sale had a duplicate (think I even saw some triplets) 
(I'd see: $10.02, $5.54, $5.54, $18.89, $20.30, $30.40, $30.40 and so on) 
I've seen this at other stores aswell when there were discrepencies so I knew where to look. Eventlog for computer restart! And yes, at every time there was a double transaction there were a reboot nearby. 
So after gathering all of the information following conversation occured (again not a actual conversation and also these are a wild dramatization) 

OP: Hi everyone, please gather up for the best detective you have ever seen, yours truly, have found the culprit. It's your PoS POS! 
You see, every time the POS hangs your employees just restart the PoS. When this occures during a sale the POS still remember that theres a transaction, but it can't be resumed, instead it just sends it to the card company that reject it as a duplicate. 
So looking at the transactions on the POS it looks like theres money missing. 
The hard drive on this particular POS is dying, so it hangs alot more than usual, thats why the numbers are so high. 

(what I imagine their reply to be) 

DRC: Wow OP, you are truly the best detective

SM: You are so smart! 

(what their actual reply was) 

DRC: Oh, thanks, SM please place an order for a new drive. 

SM: Meeh

392,I never used something like a Computer before,"Hello again,Since my first Post came good, I decided to tell you another Story from my early Days in TechSupport. It is more Dialogue but I think this is important content

Again, POS Systems. I've got a call from EntitledCustomer (EC)

HS: ""Welcome to Company Customer Support, It's HentaiSenpai230797 speaking""  
EC: ""Hello there, this is EntitlesCustomer from EntitledRetailer speaking. I have an Issue with my POS number 4. It shows a red cross.""  


I knew this Issue. Means the POS lost connection. Normally you just restart it and it works again.  


HS: ""Could you please turn off the Computer and turn it on again?""  
EC: ""One Second please..."" \*You hear Flip-Switch\* ""Yeah it is off""  
HS: ""I heard a flip-Switch. What did you turn off?""  
EC: ""The small Black Box next to the Monitor""  
\*Facepalms\* She turned off the Receipt Printer  
HS: ""You turned off the Printer. I need you to turn off the POS Computer""  
EC: Walks through the Store. Going to the Store Manager. ""I need you to turn off the PC. POSSoftwareTechSupport told me to""  
\*Very Huge Facepalm\*

I shouted ""Stop"" so loud the could hear me twice. Once in the Phone and the other time around the half world. ""Not the Backoffice PC, the Computer at the POS!""

Back at the POS, EC turned off Monitor, Electronic Cash Terminal, the UPS, the printer (twice) and the conveyor Belt. From fail to Fail I was more and more annoyed.

EC: ""There is now one device which says Fujitsu""  
HS: ""This is the Computer! Please turn it off""  
EC: ""But I don't use that Computer! Our POS are no Computers. I never used a Computer in my whole life! I don't touch this""  
HS: ""Your POS is a Computer, same as the EC-Terminal, your Smartphone, the Box your customers get the Cigarette Tickets from"" (very common in this region. It's a Tablet with a printer where you get Tickets for Cigarettes, Razorblades and Anti-Baby Balloons. You pay at the Checkout and then Scan these Tickets in huge Vending Machines which throw them out)  
EC: ""This is BS! It is a POS and not a Computer! And my Smartphone is not a Computer either""

EC Hung up, 2 Hours later another Colleague from the Store called but was connected to my colleague. they did not restart the POS because it was a Computer... 2 Days later there was a complaint about me from EntitledCustomer for litterally ""Speaking BS and no will to fix the POS"" My Supervisor was already aware of this call. They showed me the Letter. We returned the complaint with another complaint about EntitledCustomer.

Dear EntitledRetailersHeadquater,

we return the Complaint back to you with the information, Mrs. EntitledCustomer refused to follow the Customer Services commands with the reason never touched a Computer in any ways.

393,Predecessor?! - Part 1: The hiring,"This story will take you along with me through one of my craziest adventures in this field. Usually I wouldn't include the process of getting the job into a story, but here it is necessary.

&#x200B;

As I was working for my previous employer, I had moved out of the city and into one of the most beautiful countrysides in this country, which caused me to drive 2.5 hours per day to get to work and back. Since it was right when the pandemic started, I thought this was the right timing to do the move as I could just work from home. Wrong! Boss wanted me to drive to work nontheless. I found that weird as I was the only employee raking in any profit for the small company. The rest was an intern, one in finance and that's it. So the support I provided to all our customers was our biggest income. Soooo I started looking for a job elsewhere because of this and other reasons.

&#x200B;

I changed my status in one of those websites, where you can get recruited, to ""looking for an opportunity"". After a day my inbox was getting swarmed and I started to sort through the vacancies. One job caught my eye in particular. IT-company of a multi-billion holding, production sites all over the world, looking for a sysadmin in this beautiful but remote countryside. So I declared my curiosity and we got to talk.

&#x200B;

During the first phone-call, I talked to the head of the IT-department. He told me the production sites in my area were getting bigger and bigger and could no longer be supported remotely from HQ which is a several hours drive away. He explained how this holding is structured, what we produce and how those things are later on processed/used by our customers, as we are also producing some kind of fabric among many many other things. He mentioned that every new worker can choose the brand of their company cell phone and laptop. The rest was normal chit-chat, getting a feeling of one another and we end the call agreeing to talk to each other again, but that time with one more person in the call.

&#x200B;

During the second call, the other person in the call was someone who set up all the infrastructure decades ago and is still providing external support to the holding. This call was divided into 2 parts. First part was him explaining the whole structure to me and how all of it is connected, redundancies, backups, company-guidelines for hardware/software and much more. The second part was a test of my knowledge and procedures as I was being given potential scenarios and what I think the causes of those would be and how I'd go about solving the issues. Both parts took over an hour. As exhausting as this was, they seemed pleased and wanted to see me in person.

&#x200B;

During that meeting there were 3 people present:

\- The CEO of the company (not of the holding!) where I would have my office at

\- The head of IT that I talked to during those 2 phone calls

\- The CIO of the holding and thus the boss of the head of IT

&#x200B;

Again the conversation went great, we started talking about certain off-topic subjects and it turned out the CIO is a big anime-nerd like I am (met my wife at an anime forum) and his wife is Japanese. After talking about $$$ and seemingly found a number we both agreed upon, we take a tour through the factory. For someone like me who had only worked at small businesses before, this was huge. Really really huge. The main site is 35,000m² or about 377000 square feet, and I was told that the other 3 sites in that vicinity that I would potentially also be in charge of, would raise that to about 130,000m² or about 1.4 million square feet. Those other 3 sites are about half an hour drive away from the main site. We returned to the conference room and had some parting words as both sides declared ongoing interest. They mentioned they would meet the only other person still in the race in 2 days and then make their decision.

&#x200B;

2 days later I get the call that they want me. I quit my job and signed the new contract. I had some weeks off inbetween my last day at the previous job and the start of the new one, so I could relax a bit, though I was clearly nervous. I used the time to decide which phone and laptop I want and sent that to my boss, but he somewhat evaded that topic, saying we can discuss that on my first day. Made me slightly suspicious.

&#x200B;

So it was time, my first day at that new job, filled up with coffee and anxiety, I appeared at the gates and am welcomed by my boss and we went to the company's HR department .

(Note: This is NOT my HR, as this HR only handles issues of their workers. As someone employed by the IT-company that provides support to all other companies inside the holding, my HR is actually at HQ.)

The head of HR gave me a cellphone, some papers I should sign that I received certain items and points at laptop-case, saying that those belonged to my predecessor....uhm....my what?!...what????

Before I could recover from this shock she had to take an important phone call. I looked over to my boss who wouldn't make any eye-contact, knowing how I must feel and he seemed extremely embarrassed about this situation. As I was sitting there, head of HR still on the phone, I was contemplating what I should do. Just leave without a comment?! Understandable, yes. Reasonable, no, as I still had to pay my bills. Voice my anger/disappointment? Again understandable, but not reasonable as what good would that have done? As my thoughts were getting more and more structured after the initial shock, I decided to say nothing. I didn't know why they lied to me, but nothing I could have done seemed like it would have improved the already embarrassing and tense atmosphere. I decided to look for a different job while giving them a chance to redeem themselves with a good explanation which I would be slowly but surely be pushing for.

394,"""All my changes are gone! I'm going to cry!""","I work for a small organization at the help desk. I just received a call. I kid you not just a few minutes ago about the changes made to a file not being saved.

I asked the user if they usually use the CTRL + S key command or click the ""Floppy Disk"" icon in Excel. They said they don't remember because the file would always ""auto-save"".

This got me thinking that they may be using OneDrive to save the file and I know the O365 apps can AutoSave to a designated location on OneDrive in real-time. That wasn't the case at all and the user was saving to a network folder, which shows it had not been modified since yesterday.

I tried to put it gently, but realistically that the file was not saved and that it was not possible to recover said changes. The user sounded sad and upset because they were sure that all the files that were worked on get saved automatically because all the new changes are there after re-opening the file.

I was kind of upset that the user didn't take accountability and tried to shift the blame to IT by saying that files were not autosaving after another member of our team helped with an unrelated issue.
The user then proceeded to let out a heavy sigh and I apologized. Welp. Next time use the Save option.",30,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF441880>
395,Check the paper in the tray,"Had a ticket opened up that all the paper is coming out of tray 2 and by passing tray 1.  Now this is a problem, because tray 2 is perforated paper meant for printing coupons and tray 1 is plan paper for printing everything else. And all the programs that print to the printer are set-up so that if you print the thing that requires the perforated paper, it automatically picks the right tray and vice versa. 

From the title you can probably guess the problem.  I check all the settings and nothing has changed, so I open tray 1 and look in it, someone has put perforated paper in tray 1.  So it wasn't bypassing the tray, it was printing from the tray, someone just put the wrong paper in it.",21,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF4418E0>

This dude had the patience of a saint because he kept calmly repeating the same thing over and over.   Eventually the call ended and I had to ask if who he was speaking to was a Doctor and what area he worked in.      He said yes and asked why?

397,"""I'm allergic to chemicals, you're going to buy me a new computer!""","This memory popped on my timeline this morning...

Used to run a computer repair shop.   One of the standard operating procedures, was of course to dust out the fans with compressed air.  

We also ran down the entire repair manifest with the customer at pickup time.  (This eliminated the ""well you never told me you...""  or ""Why is it $85, when all you had to do was..."")    So we tell her we tested all of the output voltages, dusted the system fans...   at which point she exploded.

""YOU DID WHAT?!  YOU USED CHEMICALS ON MY COMPUTER!""

No, m'am, we dusted out your computer.  ""WITH CHEMICALS?!""
No, m'am, we have an air compressor in the back, it has a moisture dryer on it, and is piped to all of the work benches.  It's just compressed air.    ""But it's a machine, so it puts chemicals into the air, and I'm ALLERGIC TO CHEMICALS"".

M'am, no, I assure you any traces of chemicals would have long dissipated if that were even possible.

""YOU'RE GOING TO BUY ME A NEW COMPUTER!  THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS.  NO ONE TOLD YOU TO SPRAY CHEMICALS ON MY COMPUTER"".

M'am let me get this straight, you want us to buy you a new computer, of which the parts are MADE IN CHINA, with all SORTS OF CHEMICALS used in the manufacturing process to give to you?

Well, she huffed and puffed and stormed out.

398,"Spoiler alert, computers require electricity to function","This is the first time I’ve ever written up something like this on Reddit, so apologies if it is a little rough around the edges. 

I work in IT at a school district, in a team that consists of just two people, including me. As you can imagine, having such a small team covering multiple campuses can make things pretty hectic. Add some rather unpleasant people to the mix, and things can be pretty stressful for us.    
   
One particular week, I was given the task of going to every classroom in the district (labs included) and setting up the PCs that have been pulled out due to the floors being cleaned. Unfortunately, we were not the ones who pulled out the desks and PCs, so a lot of the setup and cable managed desktops turned into jumbled messes thrown back onto their desks. From people having their desks put into awful locations multiple feet away from network jacks and power, and tangled cables that will forever haunt my nightmares, I definitely had my work cut out for me. But, I managed to get the job done. Cables may not have been expertly managed with cable ties and whatnot, but all the PCs I set back up were double checked by myself to ensure they turned on and operated properly.  

Most people were perfectly fine with how I set their PCs back up. Of course though, there is always that one person that you can’t please. That one person who hates the IT department with a passion. That particular individual, was far from happy with their new setup. They decided to issue a complaint in which they claimed their cables were all over the place, their speakers were no longer functioning, and now their PC no longer powers on. I knew there was no way any of this was possible from my end, as I thoroughly checked each PC I worked on, but I decided to be the nice IT guy and check it out.   
   
Luckily, they were not in their classroom, so I was able to investigate with no interruptions. The first thing I noticed was they had completely moved both the computer AND the desk to the other side of the room. That checks off the first complaint, as the cable disaster was caused by her moving the PC herself instead of calling us. Next I moved onto seeing if the PC powered on, which it did not. Intrigued, I checked the power cable, which was *not even plugged into the power strip*. I wish I was making this up. Either that was done on purpose, or they don’t realize computers need electricity to function. After being plugged into power, the PC booted up, with everything working, including the speakers. I reported my findings and left the building. Since then, we luckily have not been bothered by this individual.   
   
I’ll never understand why people act like this, but hey, it keeps us employed :D",68,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF441A00>
399,something you rarely want to hear from a service provider of any kind,"Another tale from my days as a sysadmin/tech support person for a University.

The building we occupied was slated to be completely renovated, top to bottom.  It was originally built in the late 1960s so we were pretty jazzed to begin this project.

Since I was the head of the systems and tech support group, I got called in early to meet with the various planning folks and the outside architects to come up with the networking and power requirements.

The University had various standards for what was provided for each room based on some formula, plus the appropriate building codes.   A faculty office was so many square feet, had so many power outlets, and so many network drops, should have a window.  A staff office was smaller, might not have a window, and so on.  A laboratory had this or that depending on the type, conference room had a projector or flat panel monitor, or whatever.

From the get-go I stressed that as a ""computer intensive"" department, we would need more power outlet and more network drops than the standard.  Which meant we would also need more switches, so the data/communications room might have to be larger also.  

The architectural company had sent two people to attend the meetings, an older guy and younger woman.  Both were very professional but as the meeting went on I got the impression the younger person didn't understand what our special requirements would involve.  The older guy didn't say much, mostly he was taking notes on his laptop.

By the end of the first meeting, which lasted three hours I think, we were wrapping things up and I had the sinking feeling that I was going to have to justify our special needs several times more.   The University planning folks were clearly concerned about fitting this project into the budget they had been given, and I was making waves right at the start.

There was a funny incident as we were walking out of the conference room.  The young lady, who was very enthusiastic, gave me a smile and remarked on how exciting this project was.   ""We've never done a project like this before!""

I kind of did a double take, forced myself not to laugh, and said something like, ""you might not want to spread that piece of information around too much"".

She looked at me with a puzzled look on her face, then realized what I meant and gave me a sheepish grin.  

In the end the project was completed with a minimum of headaches, but it was a long haul.",55,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF441A60>
400,"The dreaded ""can you fix my xyz"" by family members","It finally happened. I was quite lucky, only having to install Sims every other month on my wife's laptop ('wife: stupid admin popup again, why can't I have admin rights? me: because you can't even next-next-finish a simple installer. wife: dagger stare'). My career is not related to tech support at all, but like every self-respecting geek who grew up in the nineties, I'm handy around most tech, which I was able to hide from my family so far.

Fast forward to today, I'm chilling in my beanbag, quietly cursing the sadists behind Advent of Code while my mom and wife are talking and trying to keep my daughter both alive and entertained (not an easy job). My mom notices that I have a ""new"" laptop I'm using, and asks if I got it for Christmas. Quite  an innocent question, then my wife starts bragging that it's her old laptop I saved from the junk pile with a simple battery replacement. My mom suddenly goes into a tirade how shitty her current (personal) laptop is, it's slow, overheats and runs a self-diagnostic on every boot with some warning. She even took it to the IT guys at her work (remember, personal hardware) and they were so rude, they refused to help her, she only spilled some coffee on/in it, it's not THAT sticky and covered in nail polish mixed with cigarette ash. After this bombardment she looks at me expectantly 'You can fix it for me, right???'.

I started to weigh my options there.

a; I can go over and try to save that poor machine. Probably filled with all kind of nasty, battery dying, dust mixed with sugar clinging to everything.

b; tell her to stop bothering the IT guys at work, go to a repair place, who will probably refuse service or rip her off.

c; with a sigh I looked for a win10 installation media in my drawers, plugged it into the ""brand new"" laptop I'm using and asked her to bathe her granddaughter while the installation finishes. Now I am listening to Cortana's stupid questions while promising myself that this time I WILL create a fresh image with all necessary software installed or at least a chocolatey deployment script (probably won't happen, like the past n times).

Merry Christmas Mom, and thank you (secretly) as I now have a good excuse for my wife why I need a new gaming laptop :)

&#x200B;

Bonus story: there was a stupid mahjonng game my mom loved waaay back, it was a trial version with 30 days. Uninstalling and reinstalling didn't work obviously, however I quickly figured out if I delete all registry entries related to the game the counter will restart. A couple years later I went to university and unsurprisingly my phone rang in about two weeks in, it was my mom 'Mahjonng is not working.' I tried to give as simple instructions as possible. 'Open start menu - click on run - type in regedit then press enter - once the registry editor is open press F3, type in ""pgmj"" in the search field, press enter, delete the entry, repeat until there are no more entries.' Mom said she got it, hangs up. Phone rings again 5 minutes later 'I deleted regedit.exe but the game still isn't working. Can you fix it?' Told her to look for ""HOMM3.exe"" on my PC and we will talk about mahjongg when I go home for Christmas. She haven't played mahjongg since then but regularly beats me in all of the Heroes games. Sometimes even in Civ... Perks of being a semi-retired widow with way too much time on her hands I guess?",78,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF29D670>
401,4 Not Workin Cash Registers,"This happened about 6 months ago. I had early shift in First Level Support. We produced software for Cash registers.  


I wasn't finished with my first coffee the phone ran. A very upset client called!  


Client: All my Cash registers are dead! And one is beeping!  
Me: The PCs cannot beep if they are down. It must be something else beeping. Maybe a security System?  
Client: Well, there are saying APC. Only one is on, but shows ""Low Battery""  


Since UPSses were not our responsibility I informed the customer, that he has to open a Ticket on his IT-Department.  


Client: But I cannot reach out for them. My phone is dead, the Back-office PC is dead, I only have my cellphone!  


I asked the customer to check his breakers. After about 10 Seconds the client said ""Well, the Lights finally turned on! And the Cash registers are also booting up.""  
I ended the call, noted down the Ticket.  
Not knowing, I'm gonna go crazy with this Job soon. Turned out the Circuit breakers popped another 10 times before the store nearly caught fire! Luckily no failure on our side. (Short ciruit in a Splitter-Box)

402,Retailer wants admin access to the POS machine,"Abit of background. This happened more than few years ago when I was still at phone support. We served one of the bigger company that owned a particular high end mall in our city. This includes their Windows XP, and yes win7 had been out for ages, machines they ran for their POS.

Roughly paraphrased (heck it have been a few years), translated (for your benefit) and dramatized (also for your benefit). 
BC = blond clerk
OP = super experianced support person of 3 months. 

OP: Hello this is Tech Support, you're talking to OP. 

BC: Hi, this is BC from store such and such. I need you to do some techy stuff and grant me admin access. I can't run this USB cause it keeps asking for password. 

OP: Im sorry, did you say USB? What are you trying to run? I assume you mean at the back office computer?

BC: It's a bank USB and no I'm at the POS.

OP: I'm not quite following, what kind of USB was it? Where did you get it?

BC: Listen, I have a gentleman here waiting I dont have time for this, just do your thing and fix the access. It's a big sale and he's in a hurry.

OP: I understand, but per company policy we need to ask these questions for administrative access. So please just explain what it is you're trying to do and why.

(at this point I've connected to the POS to check whats up, it was the old fashioned login to grant admin popup and a drive open with an icon litteraly just named Bank.exe)

BC: (i could hear her sigh) look, this gentleman is a diplomat from china just bought $40k (or something) worth of jewellery. He need us to open this bank program to authorize the transfer to our POS. When I try to do that it keeps asking for administrator login.

(I was gasping by shock at the stupidity and my colleagues already put on the speaker on my phone) 
OP: Ok, thank you. Unfortunatly this program is not in the preauthorized list of applications we're allowed to install.
(theres no such list, no apps is ever to be installed or run on POS thats not in the default image)
So I'll have to send this for approvement.

BC: We can't wait for that, I'm going to miss a huge sale and I'll make sure they know you are the cause! Just give me the access!

OP: Sorry, I need to follow policy, but I'll make sure to go directly to the IT director of the company to get this fasttracked.

Got some more rants and we finally hung up.
I did send a email to the IT director with all of the details.

This girl, which was probably around 25, not only ran the program on the POS but then called to demand admin access....
Looked her up in the system a few months later, her account terminated xD (usually they inactivate most accounts to make it easier to rehire/seasonal work)",147,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF441C70>
403,I will never find it again,"Hey, everyone. I hope you all are doing all right.

So, I’m not much of a talker. Sometimes It feels like I'm a spy: I don't post, I don't comment, I don't upvote… I just watch. Anyways, I figured if I ever was gonna say something somewhere, it must be on this sub. What follows isn’t an epic story, in fact, it may seem a little silly to you, but what would be of this sub without the silly things users do? So, here it goes.

First of all, a little background: i work as an IT at a school for students aged 4 through 18. You know, the usual: help the users with their tasks, solve problems with windows, applications, printers. One of these days, one of my coworkers (coworker1) was sitting next to me, looking for something on youtube. She had to leave the computer for a few minutes. While she was gone, another coworker sat at the computer to do another task. When coworker1 came back, she saw someone had used the computer and closed the page she left open. She started to complain:

– coworker1: somebody closed google chrome. How am I gonna find that same page again? It was exactly what I needed, It was perfect. Now I will never find it again.

– me: let me tell you about something called browser history. You see, google chrome keeps track of every page we open. So it’s easy to find the same page again.

I then proceeded to hit Control + H on her keyboard and said:

– me: There it is, all the pages visited on this computer.

Without even trying, she kept saying:

– coworker1: It’s not here. I will never find it again.

Then I gave a closer look and saw that just three pages were visited that day: google search for youtube, youtube homepage and whatever was the title of the video she opened. Then I clicked on the page with the video title, and would you look at that, exactly the video she was looking for.

– coworker1: thanks, othiagogomes. you really are a lifesaver.

Forget the lack of knowledge or experience or whatever. What baffles me the most is that even when you give them everything they need, even a thing as simple as the browser history, they still won’t be able to do it.

You know the saddest part? I am sure she learned nothing. If faced with the same “problem” again in the near future, she won’t know what to do. Let’s just hope I am nearby. That’s my job, afterall.",35,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF441E80>
404,The day it rained indoors on a sunny day.,"Forgive my formatting I have no excuse I am trash.

Since y'all liked my last post I thought I'd include one from my early ~~hell~~ help desk at *insert big name retail company*

TLDR: a house fire and some photos made it rain indoors on a sunny day.

Cast:

Me: Me (help desk whipping boy)

CX: Customer

CW: coworker who knew his own limits and was a hoot.

I was ~~unfortunately~~ actually on the floor selling products when this cx came in stating his pc was acting strange and wasn't running right when using Microsoft word. My cw took it in made the ticket and was explained it could take some time to diagnose the problem and we'd reach out to him with the issue and cost for fix if could be done.

Once I was done ~~selling my soul~~ helping my customer I started working on the few computers we had in the back when I saw the ticket I figured I'd do a reset of windows 10 on the computer and reinstall office (he had an older version with a permeant license before the days of 365) so I was copying all the needed codes and I did a back up (technically we are supposed to charge for these but ~~screw corporate~~ I wanted to help the customer!

Well while doing the back up I noticed there wasn't really a whole lot some tax documents, work files and pictures of their kid and them so I just did an old copy paste to a usb rather than a full clone mid back up his hard drive failed.

Well crap at least I have some of the back up right? Wrong.

A little panicked I hooked up his hard drive to our work desktop with a sata to usb tool and after much finagling I was able to get into the drive to run our clone/recovery tool to back up what ever files we could.

Couldn't get much but got most of the photos and a few files.

So I called him explained what happened and he wanted to keep the laptop so we swapped in a replacement hdd we actually had one spare we were gonna chunk (had just done inventory and rather than correct the totals my boss preferred the ol chunk and hope LP never noticed. Needless to say chunk usually meant techs took turns taking extra merch home from pens to ssds so long as they were less than 100$ anything was fair game after inventory. It just so happened this hdd was gonna go home with cw but he didn't need it and this way we could probably still skirt by having to charge the cx.

So we replaced the hard drive reinstalled everything and put all his files into a folder labeled back up. We figured since it was a slow day behind the counter we wouldn't even charge him.

We gave him a call and when he got there I was explaining what we did and showing him the few files we found and mid sentence he breaks down crying and bear hugged me in the middle of the store. I'm not really a hug guy more of a pat on the back but I was so taken back I just kinda froze and when he released me, he explained that the photos of his son he thought were lost, he had passed away from cancer almost a year ago and after their house fire they lost all their physical photos and all of his stuff since they weren't very tech literate and couldn't find where they had saved them on the computer they had effectively lost anything of him.

He tried to pay us we refused and called the check out counter and told them his money was no good so he couldn't try to leave anything at the front for us either.

The weather forecast called for a sunny day but man it was raining behind that counter I swear.",41,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF784A60>
405,"I am the Lorax, and I speak for the trees","TL:DR We had a lady in AR who printed every email, web page, etc. and claimed it was due to her eyesight being bad. She was claiming some weird ADA accommodation and it actually had to hit Legal before she was finally disciplined. Keep reading for specifics.

Her workflow was horrific. Print document, edit it by hand, scan in edits and email to herself, print that AGAIN, and scan to email to the customer.She had filled every single drawer, cabinet, and work surface at her desk and even a few filing cabinets out on the floor with her printouts.

IT got involved because they were going through toner at an insane rate and she was basically treating this departmental printer like a personal printer. (One of her suggestions for an accommodation was to get her a personal printer, which only addressed one of the problems - lady was not very socially aware.) No joke we got a call from our printer contractor to inform us that we were exceeding our maintenance cycle by a lot. I personally hated every inch of it because of the sheer volume of paper she was wasting. Literal reams per week. More than the rest of her department and this is AR, who has to keep a lot of paper records.

IIRC her claim was that her eyes were bad and the screen caused eye strain, so under the ADA she was allowed accommodations. I suggested an e-ink reader of some sort, the boss kicked it to Legal, Legal pointed out she had not provided any documentation of a disability and that even if she had this didn't meet the definition of a ""reasonable accommodation"" by any stretch.

Unbeknownst to IT at the time, it was actually worse than we thought. Her desire to avoid using a screen had her enlisting other people in the department to file her reports, again using her hand-edited printouts, which of course generated more printouts once the reports were finalized.

Yes, there were several threats of a lawsuit from her. We're pretty laid back at our company so no one retaliated or took things too seriously but HR and Legal had to sit her down and explain how the ADA actually works. Ultimately we offered to accommodate her with special glasses, screen filters, even ordering special screens to reduce blue light, and she was adamant that she didn't want them and had to be allowed to print everything.

Boot came down. No unnecessary printing, period. She could either take the offered accommodations or not at her preference but printing was now a no-no. Her desk would need to be cleaned - we had to replace the overhead because the IKEA grade wood was warping under the weight.

It took three interventions by IT and many more from her manager before her printing got down to something resembling the rest of her department. Part of her disciplinary action was being moved to the desk farthest from the printer, which I found endlessly amusing.

Not sure if that's why she got fired but she was fired some time later.

Somewhat related, my dad worked with a guy who kept so much paper at his desk the Fire Marshall declared it a hazard during an inspection.",254,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF784AC0>

407,"A Symphony of Fail (Part 3, Finale)","Hello once more, everyone!  I hope you all have enjoyed everything so far.  For today, we'll get to the finale of this story :)  Here are the previous parts: [Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/rmasuq/a_symphony_of_fail_part_1/) [Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/rnmk82/a_symphony_of_fail_part_2/)

All of this is from the best of my memory along with some personal records, but ultimately it is how I remember things.  There certainly can be some inaccuracies.  Also, I don't give permission for anyone else to use this.

TL/DR: Read, or do not read.  There is no TL/DR.

Again, for context, I am not in IT; rather, I'm a GIS (Geographic Information Systems) professional.  This particular world is quite small, so I will do what I can to properly anonymize my tale.  However, for reference, I work for a municipality in the American South.  Here is my Dramatis Personae for Part 3:

* **$Me**: Please tell me you don't need a description of who this is.
* **$GreaterIT**: IT Director.  Good guy, horribly overworked, I try to do all I can to make his life a little easier.
* **$IncAnalyst**: The bane of my existence.
* **$IncLiaison**: Incompetent sales manager/liaison for the project.  Clueless but ultimately not lazy or mean-spirited.
* **$IncManager**: Incompetent project manager, both incompetent herself and also covering for her team's incompetence.
* **$TP**: Terrible Product.  Absolutely awful georeferencing product, inaccurate, incomplete, and faulty.  Deserved only to be flushed down the toilet (see what I did there? :D )
* **$Bystander**: Clueless analyst thrown into the middle of all this with no context.  He didn't last long, not his fault.
* **$AmazingAnalyst**: The complete opposite of **$IncAnalyst**.  The true hero of this saga, the one we all need but don't deserve.

And now - the finale!

After providing my giant book of all the GIS problems with **$System** to **$GreaterIT**, I didn't hear much anymore from the reps.  I suppose when all you say is ""*everything you're doing is bad, I want you to know this*"" and then send detailed reports showing just how bad everything is to their bosses, it has sort of a chilling effect.  No matter.  Completely deserved.

However, I did continue to check in with **$GreaterIT** from time to time.  I made him aware that I would continue to provide GIS review of the product whenever necessary, and if he needed explanations of anything, I would be available.  When I asked what the status of the project was, he eventually told me that the GIS components had been brought up during one of his meetings.  The company execs asked if all the issues I'd brought up had been handled, and **$IncAnalyst** said ""she'd done everything I'd asked for.""  Predictably, I was livid upon hearing this, but I wasn't particularly surprised.  I told **$GreaterIT** that the GIS issues were *not* resolved by any stretch; I had just been in the dispatch system that morning and confirmed it looked identical to the garbage I'd reviewed previously.  So in addition to all the other things that **$IncAnalyst** had done, she had now outright lied as well.  Thus completes her trifecta of horribleness - *Laziness*, *Incompetence*, and *Deceit*.

Anyways, months passed.  I wasn't involved much in the project anymore.  I assumed it would be abandoned eventually.  Then, rather suddenly, a global pandemic crept up and covered the land.  I was now working from home.  One day as I was attempting to construct some GIS features while my daughter was building Lego dinosaurs on my legs, I got an email from **$IncManager**.  The whole email was something like this:

>""Hey **$Me**, could you send some address features to **$Bystander**?  We need to reconfigure the GIS portions of **$System** and this will get him started.""

Huh.  Interesting.  Who was **$Bystander**?  If he was on the project instead of **$IncAnalyst**, then that was a step in the right direction.  Anyone, I felt, would be better than her.  However, if **$System** was going to continue to use **$TP** as the primary georeferencing component it would still have a lot of problems.  I still hadn't gotten a convincing accuracy assessment to that point.  Also, in the intervening time since I had last communicated on this project, I had learned a few more things.  One thing I'd learned about was a bunch of legal implications surrounding the use of our data.  And I discovered that if we were taking data that had been provided to us from an third party (say, by the jurisdiction my municipality was located within) and providing that in such a way that an external party could access it (such as, say, uploading it into **$TP**'s system), we would be in breach of our NDA.  Lawsuits and stuff.  Fun times.  So I wanted some clarifications on all of this.

I sent **$IncManager** a response asking for some clarification on how any data I sent to them would be used, and if there was potential for it to get to another party, requested that we work on a data usage agreement to stop that.  I told her that I would not send the data over until we'd rectified this.  I was also still waiting on a suitable accuracy assessment before I signed off on the GIS part of the product.  **$IncManager**'s response to me was something like this:

>""Great!  **$Bystander** will be waiting for your data.""

*WTF*?  Can you not read?  I must have slammed my fist on the desk, because my little girl said something like ""Daddy, don't hurt the computer, it hasn't been mean to you.""  Awww.  I gave her a hug.  That brought a smile to my face :)

Anyways, despite my daughter's ministrations, I was pissed off.  **$IncManager** did not read what I said at all.  I sent a follow up with probably the tersest language I'd used to that point saying that I hadn't agreed to provide any data, what I wanted to do was confirm how it was going to be used and suitably protect it.  And this said nothing of its accuracy.  I then asked for her to give me a call to explain.  She responded shortly thereafter with a ""Whoops, misread your email"" (code for: *Whoops, didn't read your email*) and said she'd call me the next day at a specific time.  I waited for her call the following day at the specified time, and she didn't call.  But she did call me the day after.

On that call, I was still pretty short with her at the beginning, but gradually the timber of the call changed.  I asked how our data was going to be used and how **$TP** would fit into all this, and **$IncManager** said that **$TP** had been thrown out.  Woohoo!  They were going instead with segmented instances of geospatial data provided by each individual jurisdiction (walled off where each jurisdiction couldn't be seen by the others).  Alright!  I then asked if **$IncAnalyst** would continue to be the project lead.  **$IncManager** said that **$IncAnalyst** was no longer associated with this project.  **$Bystander** would now be my main contact.  Sweet baby Jesus, did you just provide me with *THREE* miracles?  Thank you!

I finished that call feeling happier than I had in a long time.

I wound up speaking to **$Bystander** about a month later.  It was clear that he had been thrown into the project with little (or no) onboarding, and he really didn't know what had happened here.  He didn't seem incompetent, just thrown into the situation without any context.  I spoke to him about what the new project design was going to be with **$System**.  Based on what he said, I didn't feel like there were any legal issues anymore.  So I provided him with every bit of data he asked for.  He thanked me, and that was the first and last time I ever spoke to him.

Several months went by.  I didn't see **$GreaterIT** much, so I sort of lost touch with how the project was progressing.  Honestly, I'd kind of written it off at this point.  If **$Bystander** could turn things around, that's was fine, but it seemed like public safety really disliked the system no matter what.  No amount of retooling was going to fix that.  I assumed it would be replaced sooner or later.

Several months later, around two years after I'd first been brought on board with all this, I got yet another email about **$System**.  **$GreaterIT** had found out that a new analyst had been assigned to the project.  She seemed to be enthusiastic and wanted to communicate about it.  She even wanted to speak with me to see what had happened.  I was cautiously optimistic as I set up the conference call.

Enter **$AmazingAnalyst**.

**$AmazingAnalyst** didn't just hit the ground running, she hit the ground sprinting.  She immediately asked for any and all records on what was done to that point and where the points of failure were.  I provided her with my 400-page book :)  She actually read it!  She then asked for updated data.  She made sure to communicate with us on everything she was doing.  She ran design concepts by us and then had calls where we tested everything out.  She asked me for additional data so she could provide added functionality in **$System** that it didn't have before.  She created an editing portal for us.  She integrated our highly-accurate location data.  She confirmed all the legal issues I had questions about.  She was, in short, amazing.  **$AmazingAnalyst**, if you are reading this and recognize who you are, please know that you are one of the most talented GIS professionals I've ever had the pleasure of working with.  If you ever need a reference, just ask.

In two months, **$AmazingAnalyst** had created an awesome product that was ten times better than the digital constipation that had taken **$IncAnalyst** *two whole years* to defecate out.

By the end of the year, we had a product that, from the GIS side, was incredible.  Probably one of the best I've ever seen.  Changes, updates, anything could be incorporated by **$AmazingAnalyst** with ease.  I haven't been heavily involved in this now simply because of her good work.  There are a bunch of new regulations that we'll have to incorporate over the next few years, but I honestly don't anticipate any problems (from the GIS side, at least).  **$AmazingAnalyst** and I have already started working on everything.  I think we'll be able to finish with time to spare!

And so there it is.  What started as a terrible, horrible, no-good, very-bad rollout turned into an excellent, solid product, all thanks to a healthy dose of competence spiced with a dash of hard work.

But I'm certain you all want to know what happened to the incompetent team, don't you?  And how did all this happen to start with?  Well, I won't disappoint.

Understand that most of this is based on second-hand knowledge, hearsay, gossip, and assumptions, but I'll try to piece together as much of the behind-the-scenes story as I can.  This could still be wrong.  Whatevs.

Way back in the day, somebody at the contract company decided to purchase a product known as **$TP**.  This same person eventually had to justify the purchase of **$TP** to the suits.  One problem; **$TP** is crap.  Whoever purchased the system had to be able to use it in an output product where the errors within it would have the least impact.  And, apparently, they would have to do so relatively fast.  I know!  Let's sell 911 dispatch solutions to a bunch of bumpkins in the South!  They don't know what they're doing and won't be able to rigorously test it, so we can just throw together a shoddy solution using **$TP** as the backend and get some revenue streams up and running.  Then, once the inevitable problems roll in, we can blame it on user error and foist a ""Version 2.0"" onto a different team here at the company!  Sheer genius!

Enter **$System**.  From my own perspective and those of my colleagues, we are fairly confident that it was designed to be implemented at jurisdictions that had little or no existing GIS capability.  And in some cases, the customers were exactly that; after all, we could see who else was part of the rollout due to the terrible design.  Lots of rural areas, small towns, etc.  But no matter the personnel, almost all jurisdictions have people who can tell when something is running or not, if it's entering information correctly or not, if it's doing what it has been said it can do or not.  In my case, we had people at the municipality that knew what a system like this should look like - and could clearly see that this wasn't even close.  We even compared notes with other jurisdictions that were using the same product; hilariously, the dev team told us to ""stop speaking with others on **$System**, because all rollouts are different"" (code for: *We botched the implementation and we don't want you to know how many 1s we rolled*).

So how did we end up with the system in the first place?  Well, the public safety department really was looking for a new system to replace the old one.  Enter a highly-placed admin official and a highly-placed public safety official.  Apparently there was some sort of grant or something that this new product qualified for so our municipality could get it cheaply.  Also, it was the best thing *evar*!  Admin official talked it up to city hall, while public safety official talked it up to the public safety department.  Eventually, my municipality agreed to purchase it.  At the same time, it came to light that these two officials were having an affair.  After a healthy dose of quitting/getting fired, we were left with **$System** on our doorstep as a result of their copulation.

The team selling **$System** then began its implementation at our municipality, and as can be seen, it didn't go well.  I, for one, consistently pushed back on the GIS aspects.  My pushback was mirrored in other users until virtually no one wanted to use the system at all.  The house of cards started tumbling down in the year before **$AmazingAnalyst**'s entrance.  Here are the results from when the smoke cleared:

* I am told that **$TP** was the first to go.  It was apparently a money sink for literally no benefit whatsoever.  It also was a legal liability - uploading user data into it was in violation of virtually every NDA or data usage agreement the company had in place.
* **$IncAnalyst** was removed from the project shortly thereafter.  She was ""*persuaded to retire*.""  Her LinkedIn status now states that she is ""self-employed.""  Lol.  ***Ah, yes.  The soft delight of vanquishing a foe***.
* **$IncLiaison** left the company just after (known only through her change in title on LinkedIn).  I actually felt bad for her.  I didn't think she wasn't lazy or mean-spirited, just woefully ill-suited to the role she was placed in.  She landed at a place where I hope she's better suited to the job she's doing.
* **$IncManager** was the last to go.  I am told that the reason the project continued for so long without any meaningful progress was because she kept covering for her team's laziness and incompetence.  She kept promising and promising on the smallest iota of effort and eventually it caught up to her.  She was directly fired as far as I am aware.  **$IncAnalyst** was my nemesis, but **$IncManager** *empowered* my nemesis, so there is a special level of spite I reserve for her.

And that, my friends, is it.  A terrible team attempted to push the worst GIS product I have ever seen on my municipality, are called out for it, are incapable of fixing it, are shown the door, and an amazing analyst steps in and turns it all around - further cementing just how terrible the incompetent team was.  It was a crazy journey, but one I'm happy to have seen through.  Often there are few happy endings with tales like this and I'm very glad as to how this one turned out.  I hope you enjoyed it!

Merry Christmas, and let me sign off with [u/bambam67](https://www.reddit.com/user/bambam67/)'s inspired farewell: *Until next time, don't forget to turn it off and on again* :)

408,Thinking Outside the Box,"So I'm pretty new to IT, but I think this story is too good to pass up.

I worked for a big IT company that provided support to a number of businesses, the project I worked on was a really big client, and very professional (think, be tie ready in case client pops by, at least pre-covid).

Anyway, I had a user call in who was very nice about it, but had been bounced around a couple times between level one and the application support team and was unable to do any work because her application was missing a crucial button. I looked at the ticket and thought I may as well take a crack at it. 

I remote in and the first thing I notice is that normally everything is so tiny in the remote application but I can see everything clearly on this person's machine. I open up the application and just as expected, no button. I go to open Powershell and it too is extra big. 

Thinking that it couldn't possibly be the case, I open up the display settings... the ratio was set much lower than it would be normally, I put it back to the standard and voila, button is back.

I upped the text size without altering the display ratio to accommodate the user's sight, we had a good laugh about it. 

Good lesson for me early on, check the simplest possible solution first. Definitely a case that will stick with me!",35,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF784BE0>
409,A Symphony of Fail (Part 2),"Hello everyone!  I hope you all have enjoyed the story so far.  Sorry about the delay.  For today, we're going to be diving into the swirling morass that was the analysis I did on this product, and how it failed every possible metric spectacularly.  Here's a link to the first one in case you'd like to read it: [Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/rmasuq/a_symphony_of_fail_part_1/)

All of this is from the best of my memory along with some personal records, but ultimately it is how I remember things.  There certainly can be some inaccuracies.  Also, I don't give permission for anyone else to use this.

TL/DR: Read, or do not read.  There is no TL/DR.

Again, for context, I am not in IT; rather, I'm a GIS (Geographic Information Systems) professional.  This particular world is quite small, so I will do what I can to properly anonymize my tale.  However, for reference, I work for a municipality in the American South.  Here is my Dramatis Personae for Part 2:

* **$Me**: Please tell me you don't need a description of who this is.
* **$LesserIT/$GreaterIT**: IT guy that eventually becomes the new IT Director.  Good guy, horribly overworked, I try to do all I can to make his life a little easier.
* **$IncAnalyst**: The bane of my existence.
* **$IncLiaison**: Incompetent sales manager/liaison for the project.  Clueless but ultimately not lazy or mean-spirited.
* **$IncManager**: Incompetent project manager, both incompetent herself and also covering for her team's incompetence.
* **$TP**: Terrible Product.  Absolutely awful georeferencing product, inaccurate, incomplete, and faulty.  Deserved only to be flushed down the toilet (see what I did there? :D )

Continuing the saga!

When last we left off, I had just worked about 180 hours over two weeks to provide a ton of GIS data for the rollout of our newly-developed 911 dispatch system.  I had done this to make sure we had good accurate data since I did not trust that **$IncAnalyst** would do so.  I had also asked for an accuracy analysis, because the product was incorporating **$TP** and it was sh\*t.

Surprisingly, **$IncAnalyst** sent me an accuracy analysis within a week or so.  Not surprisingly, however, I actually had a lot of other work to do, so I wound up having to tend to other things for a while.  Once work calmed down a bit, I pulled in **$IncAnalyst**'s results and got to work analyzing them.  My first look was not inspiring.  **$IncAnalyst**'s first run had an error rate of 13% - this means that out of all the addresses input into **$System**, 13% (or about 1 in 8) couldn't be found.  She'd done a second run where she changed some configuration settings, but I was not convinced of her error rate of 7%.  As such, for my test I juxtaposed her results against the awesomely-accurate GIS data we'd received from the jurisdiction that my municipality lies within.

Turns out, the error rate was closer to about 10%, even with the new configuration.  Many of the addresses had incorrectly matched to areas far away from where they existed on the ground.  Newer subdivisions (that were within the data that I had provided to the reps) were not extant within **$TP** at all.  Tons of addresses along roads were generalized to the beginning or ending of the road, with no addresses located along the road segment itself.  Many addresses were just missing.  Aliases for roads were incorrect or inconsistent.  And because there were so many problems with the locations, this meant that many addresses erroneously showed up as being within certain boundaries when they actually weren't, and vice versa.  After all, my municipality actually needs to have the legal right to respond to a call if they get sent there - and this product basically had no way to confirm that (while, of course, the original data we had provided to them could, ugh).

I wrote up my findings in a report, replete with screenshots, maps, drawings, and so on.  I then sent it off to the reps with a bunch of suggestions, the main one being that they either update **$TP** with the highly-accurate geospatial data we'd provided to them, or they get rid of **$TP** entirely and use our data instead.  I also said that what I'd seen had not convinced me of the accuracy of the product; I would accept an error rate of at most 5%, but nothing higher than that.

A couple of weeks later, I was contacted by **$IncManager** regarding my accuracy analysis report.  She told me that there really wasn't time in the project to continue to test the accuracy of the product.  Our conversation went something like this:

>**$IncManager**: All data used in this product originates from **$TP** and other sources.  It is processed by our company into a proprietary database and is held to a high accuracy standard.  
>  
>**$Me**: Is that database the same one that you ran the previous accuracy analysis through?  
>  
>**$IncManager**: Well, no.  But it is held to a higher accuracy standard than the results you received.  
>  
>**$Me**: How can I be certain of that?  You're telling me that the previous analysis you ran isn't your output data.  How can I ensure that your proprietary database is any better?  
>  
>**$IncManager**: Because it is held to a higher standard of accuracy.  
>  
>**$Me**: Again, that tells me absolutely nothing.  
>  
>**$IncManager**: Look, we are getting close to the rollout (which had been delayed by this point, btw).  There isn't time to continue these accuracy analyses.  I can allow you to gain access to the test environment and test the product directly.

Eventually, I conceded this point.  I still wasn't happy, but being able to test the actual product itself would give me some greater insights.  I told **$IncManager** that I would test this environment, but that I still was not signing off on the GIS aspects of the product until I could confirm a suitable level of accuracy.

Before I could get started doing this analysis, however, the project began to take a turn against the reps.  Apparently, some of the execs in the reps' company had taken notice of problems with the progress of **$System**.  The rollout date had been continually pushed back.  My municipality was losing patience on the project and had refused to pay for anything - and the reps had not only requested that we pay for the system, but that we pay additional fees due to ""cost overruns"" in the process!  My municipality was having none of that.  As a result, several suits were very interested to find out just what the h\*ll was going on.

I was called to a meeting with **$IncLiaison** and newly-minted **$GreaterIT** a few weeks later where I was asked about my participation in the project.  I made sure to bring along a ton of documentation as to what I had contributed (CYA, blessed be his name).  I brought up all the error problems that I had encountered along the way (and provided my analyses).  I talked about all the issues inherent in **$TP**.  While I was there, I was asked whether I'd agreed to maintain *ALL* of the GIS features for **$System** going forward.  The reps said that **$IncAnalyst** ""*was of the understanding*"" that I would be maintaining all the GIS data from here on out.  I responded with a hearty *ABSOLUTELY NOT*!  I had agreed to provide starting features because I didn't feel like they would be created in an accurate fashion, but that was all - and I had all the documentation to prove it (thank you almighty CYA).  Maintenance was explicitly to be set up and managed by the contracted company.

After that, I continued working on other projects for a while until I received access to a test environment of **$System**.  By this point, the rollout had been completed (though the product still wasn't actually being used).  What I had access to was a mirror of the production environment.  I built a testing process, then logged in and began checking the system.  Y'all, it's hard to articulate this.  You ever see something where you're like ""*this can't possibly be any worse*"" and then Fortuna just goes ""*oh wait, you were serious - let me laugh even harder*!""  That was my test here.

Only about 2/3rds of the addresses I tested could be found within **$System**.  It only had our municipality's city limits and the boundaries of some other jurisdictions that were part of this same rollout (and were very far away from us).  None of our neighboring municipalities were there.  There were no ZIP Codes.  The GIS boundaries in the system were taken directly from the features that I'd provided, with no updates or changes (they even had my name on them as the last editor with my editing date).  So much for ""*managed proprietary database held to a higher accuracy standard*.""  None of our high-quality address information was available.  Most of my address tests had at least one jurisdictional boundary wrong.  Almost everything I tested had an error, and my combined error rate was something like 40% (of all the possible jurisdictional attribute values, 40% of them were incorrect).  You know that functionality they lauded, about how the **$TP** data would let us respond to calls outside our area?  Yeah, that didn't work.  Almost nothing worked as intended.  The system looked like it had been configured by a high school student making their first GIS project using a YouTube video.

*It was literally the worst GIS product I have ever seen.*

Like the dutiful public servant I am, I recorded all this.  I then forwarded my results off to everyone involved in the project.

A few days later, **$GreaterIT** came to me and asked me if I could provide him with some information about the problems we'd been having.  I asked why.  He said that there were a ton of execs from the contracted company flying in to figure out what was going on.  There was, apparently, widespread complaints on the rollout.  The product wasn't even being used; the public safety department had reverted to using the old obsolete program that we had been trying to replace (because the location mapping element of it worked correctly).  Lol.  Anyways, more importantly (for the execs), my municipality continued to refuse to pay for the product.  I told **$GreaterIT** that I'd be happy to provide him with some documentation.  I spent the rest of the afternoon printing out logs, emails, my analysis reports, and others.  When I finished, I had a 400-page binder sitting on his desk.

**$GreaterIT** stated that when he entered his meeting later that day and was asked ""What is going on?"", he threw that bad boy down on the table and said ""***This***."" :D

And there, folks, is where we will end our story for today.  Next up, the Finale :)

410,E-Mail: Internet is still down,"This just happened, and while I understand why it did, it still makes me facepalm.

My workplace has two locations, I work at the main one while this takes place in the second location. This location has been having lots of issues with their internet recently. I get a text from someone there telling me the internet is out. The fix is simple (this time), and is just a quick reboot of the modem.

When it went out, I sent a company wide e-mail letting everyone know the internet is down. When it comes back up, I send another one letting everyone know it's back up.

Then I get this e-mail:

Hi u/GenericChineseName,

I just looked on my computer and we do not have Internet Access.

(Edit: Changed Computer Access to Internet Access because that's what the e-mail actually said.)

...So yes, she replied to an e-mail she just received with another e-mail, to let me know that she didn't have Internet... And this person is supposed to be the second in command at that location.

411,Two quickies,"Long time reader, first time to post.

Years ago, when contracted to do tech support I was summoned to rush out to a site because the computer would not boot up. I figured maybe a bad power supply because at that time the hardware was not as reliable as it is these days. Got there, went up to talk to the somewhat impatient user. It only took a minute to diagnose that the power bar cord was wrapped around a few table legs, looped back and plugged into the same power bar.

Another time, at the same location I had to rush down to figure out why a 3.5-inch floppy drive was jammed. You could not insert the disk.  This one took a lot less time. The user had put the label sticker on the wrong side of the diskette. Instead of putting it on the designated spot, it was stuck over the sliver metal slide-flap which prevented it from opening.

412,His Computer,"An elderly gentleman had his PC set up in a sort of shed outside, it was insulated, carpet on the walls, warm and generally a nice place, but full of tools, half-finished projects, self-made shelves, you know the drill. An old guy doing old guy stuff.

&#x200B;

Anyway, his PC had fallen five feet from a shelf it was on, taking the monitor with it. The case was dented, the motherboard had snapped in half, the CPU, socket, and its heatsink had ripped free of its retaining screws and the monitor was cracked clean across the screen.

&#x200B;

A competitor had got there first, but said it needed replacing, it couldn't be fixed. The old guy didn't want that.

&#x200B;

As the old gentleman berated the incompetence of anyone who couldn't ""just hammer it back into shape"", I asked if I could take it with me and come back in a few days. It needed ""some work in the workshop"". He was happy with this. He was just happy to have ""someone who knew what he was doing"" handle it.

&#x200B;

I took it back, four days later, fully working. All the guy's files were there, his desktop background of his granddaughter was there, his silly screensavers and weird desktop icon positions. All there.

&#x200B;

The competitor called me ""How the \*\^%$ did you fix that? He said it looks the same through the side window that it always did, he even said you got the cracks out of his monitor!""

&#x200B;

I brushed off the competitor. We drank together sometimes, but I didn't agree with his upsell and heavy margins. We're in a deprived area, we need to help, not hurt.

&#x200B;

The hard disk had survived, so I replaced the motherboard, setting its NIC to MAC-spoof in BIOS (to getWin7 Home Premium to not need reactivation), the CPU survived, so did the heatsink. Replaced the PSU (which had been hammered) and bought an identical monitor. Ebay got me an identical case side panel to fix his smashed acrylic window. Finally, the monitor was a fairly common 21"" Hansol, cheap as chips.

&#x200B;

""Okay, how much did you charge for all that?""

&#x200B;

""£600.""

I got dispatched to a service call at an in-home business. Report was the PC was making a weird intermittent buzzing noise but sometimes it would whine at a very high-pitch and then click and the whining would make their dog start barking.

Of course my first thought was fan, but the whining sounded more like a failing hard disk. Since this was a new customer we told them it could be a few different things. I took various fans and a couple sizes of hard disk since they couldn't tell us the size of the HDD. It was a weird size in Explorer so I wasn't sure if it had been set up wrong with the CHS translation or what.

Yes. It was a big dog. I'm not the best estimate of dog sizes or breeds but I'd guess it was over 70 lbs, and it looked like a mastiff shepherd lab mix if you do an image search.

It seemed nice enough and quieted down as soon as the owner yelled at it. Sniffed my hand, decided I was okay and walked with us down the hall to the office.

I got down on the floor to start unhooking the PC and the dog started trying to get really friendly!

>Me <pushing the dog away>: ""No! Down!""  
>  
>Owner: \*chuckle\* ""oh yeah, he always does that. Just ignore him.""  
>  
>Me: ""Could you please restrain him?""  
>  
>Owner: ""Nah, he's fine. Just ignore him. Sit Snots! Sit! Good boy."" (h/t to Cousin Eddie)

Watching the dog carefully, I got back down on the floor and he just sat there so I figured we were okay. Then suddenly the dog is up and climbing on me again.

I jumped up, grabbed the dog by the scruff and put it on the floor in submission, looked the owner in the eye and yelled: ""Secure him immediately or put him out. Your other option is this service call is cancelled, you get a 4 hour service bill with a cancel fee, and I take everything back and you pay restocking for every item I brought.""

>Owner: (yelling at me to): ""Let go of my f\*\*\*ing dog, who the F do you think you are?""  
>  
>Me: ""Option two it is. Have a nice day.""

I charged them a restocking fee for the HDD, a half-dozen fans, and a couple of CPU cooler/fan combos. The no-call on-site cancellation fee was $100 and four hours of service was around $200 if I recall correctly.

414,A Symphony of Fail (Part 1),"Hello everyone!  I've been a long-time reader but hopefully this will be my first real post.  I had another a few months back but I don't think it met the sub's rules.  I hope this one will!  And I hope to provide you all with a crazy tech story of laziness, incompetence, and just desserts :)

All of this is from the best of my memory along with some personal records, but ultimately it is how I remember things.  There certainly can be some inaccuracies.  Also, I don't give permission for anyone else to use this.

TL/DR: Read, or do not read.  There is no TL/DR.

For some context, I am not in IT; rather, I'm a GIS (Geographic Information Systems) professional.  This particular world is quite small, so I will do what I can to properly anonymize my tale.  However, for reference, I work for a municipality in the American South.  Here is my Dramatis Personae for this part:

* **$Me**: Please tell me you don't need a description of who this is.
* **$LesserIT**: One of the IT guys.  Good guy, horribly overworked, I try to do all I can to make his life a little easier.
* **$IncAnalyst**: The bane of my existence.
* **$IncLiaison**: Incompetent sales manager/liaison for the project.  Clueless but ultimately not lazy or mean-spirited.
* **$IncManager**: Incompetent project manager, both incompetent herself and also covering for her team's incompetence.
* **$TP**: Terrible Product.  Absolutely awful georeferencing product, inaccurate, incomplete, and faulty.  Deserved only to be flushed down the toilet (see what I did there? :D )

Now, on to the saga!

So our story begins in summertime a few years ago.  I was a relatively recent hire at the municipality, still trying to get my feet wet and design some geographic products for use.  Somewhat out of the blue, I get a call from **$LesserIT**.  He'd like me to help him out with their new 911 dispatch system, hereafter called **$System**.  The public safety department had purchased a new system to replace the aging one they were currently using, and the new one required a great deal of GIS support to get it up and running.  **$LesserIT** didn't feel like he had the expertise for all the GIS administration needed so he reached out to me.  I told him no problem!  I'd love to build bridges between my role and other departments.  **$LesserIT** said that he'd get the reps on the phone with me as soon as he could.

A few weeks later I sit in on a call between **$Me**, **$LesserIT**, and **$IncLiaison**.  **$LesserIT** informs me that this call is for **$IncLiaison** to tell me what kind of geographic data is needed for the project.  We hit the ground running like a flaming sack of crap.  I immediately discern that **$IncLiaison** has literally no idea what she is talking about.  She doesn't know what kind of data she's asking for nor how it is used in **$System**.  I eventually vaguely discern the types of features she wants (btw, a feature is a discrete type of geographic dataset, like the vector geometry and data for a series of stop signs, stream channels, or county boundaries).  However, **$IncLiaison** can't articulate what kind of file format she needs this in or how it will be implemented.  Eventually, I get fed up, and I tell her that we can't continue this until we have a GIS professional on the call with us to identify what they need.  **$IncLiaison** says this is no issue - she can get the analyst on the call right now (why the f\*ck wasn't she there to start with?)  Enter **$IncAnalyst.**

Now let me say that I didn't realize the problems we would encounter with **$IncAnalyst** when we first started.  All that mattered was that she seemed to understand what data they needed and how I could provide it.  So on the call, **$IncAnalyst** got me the apparent requirements for what they need and I made notes of everything.  I tell them that I'll need a little bit of time to assemble it all.  Some of the information will be coming from a larger jurisdiction that we are located within, so I'll also have to wait until they've provided that to us and an NDA is signed between all parties.  However, once that's done, I can send everything off.  We end the call on a much higher note, but I am immediately questioning what I've just gotten myself into.

The subsequent month was spent building what had been requested and getting everything straightened out between my municipality and the larger jurisdiction.  At the end of the month, I had everything in place.  I sent off everything the reps requested along with the NDA.  That's it, me finished, right?  We all live happily ever after?

*Of course not.*

After not hearing anything from the reps for several months, I was contacted out of the blue by **$IncAnalyst**.  She wanted me to review a feature she'd created.  I was caught totally unprepared for this, btw - I thought my participation in the project was done, and I actually thought her email was spam!  After confirming that it was her, I looked at her request.  After some preliminary assessing, I told her exactly what kind of review I'd perform.  It was pretty detailed.  I wanted to confirm the accuracy of what she had created because, after all, this was an emergency dispatch system.  People’s lives are at stake.  I sent all this off to her in an email and then dived in to start everything.

Unfortunately, said review didn't last but a few minutes.  Once I started poking around, all I could tell she had done was a simple conversion process that took maybe 5 minutes (at most) to complete.  I was puzzled.  Why did I need to review this at all?  Was this going to be used in **$System**?  If so, it was crap and the project needed to be re-approached.  I sent an email off to **$IncAnalyst** to this effect, trying to be as polite as I could, and waited for a response.

**$IncAnalyst** responded with a terse email saying she didn't expect me to do a review (*WTF - I just told her, in great detail, that I was going to!*) and that all she needed was a *NAME* for the file.  Again, WTF?  Why would she even bother me for a name?  Honestly, I was confused by the whole situation - what... just happened here?  Did she not understand my emails?  Did she not read them?  Was she shirking her responsibilities?  Did I not communicate effectively?  I must admit that I was not used to being told off by a coworker in this way.  I sent everyone involved a follow-up saying that I honestly didn't understand what was being requested and asked for a conference call to figure out how to proceed.  Everyone agreed to a call for the next week - **$IncAnalyst** was ""too busy"" until then.

The next week, we had said call to figure out more about **$System**, with **$Me**, **$LesserIT**, **$IncLiaison**, and **$IncAnalyst**.  It was there that I learned how **$System** was to be developed.  Rather than using the very accurate geospatial data we had provided to them, the reps were going to use data from **$TP**.  I had heard of **$TP**.  **$TP** was crap.  But the reps wanted to use it.  They gave us a load of reasons why - **$TP** was a purchased dataset that included coverage over the entire US.  It didn't require the system to rely on uploads from local users.  The reps also lauded it as a way for us to be able to dispatch to areas outside our jurisdiction, and they told us that we could upload our own local data to make it more accurate over time.  But I knew a ton of other issues with **$TP**.  I knew that the datasets used were horribly outdated, inaccurate, and had massive omissions.  I also knew that the location data within it was very generalized (which means lots of geospatial error).

I voiced all these complaints on the call.  **$IncLiaison** didn't seem to understand what was going on, but even **$IncAnalyst** admitted that my accuracy concerns were genuine.  I told them that I wanted to review **$System** to get a sense of the overall level of error that would be inherent within it, because again, this was an emergency dispatch system.  **$IncAnalyst** and **$IncLiaison** say perfect!  We'll talk about that at the site visit they're having later in the month!  It's going to be a GIS-based site visit, so all my questions would be answered.  At this, **$LesserIT** (who was in my office with me) threw his hands up in the air - this was the first he'd heard of the site visit being GIS-based.  Ah, wondrous communication.  I am certain this is no surprise to most of y'all.

On to the site visit!  When I arrived, the whole cast of this saga was there - an exasperated **$LesserIT**, the reps **$IncAnalyst** and **$IncLiaison**, and now a wild **$IncManager** had appeared.  Ugh.  It's from this meeting that the title is taken.  There was so much fail.  One of the craziest parts of the whole visit was the gradual change in rep's attitudes - from a cocky, assertive ""*here's-how-this-project-will-work-and-you're-going-to-like-it*"" to a far more hesitant ""*huh-there-are-a-lot-of-flaws-here-and-we-hoped-you-couldn't-tell*"" mindset.  As said, there were so many problems.

The reps chastised me for not providing sufficient geographic data for them to use as the starting features in **$System**.  I immediately retorted back that I had provided everything they had requested, and if they had wanted more/different features, they should have asked for them.  I then provided the email trail (CYA, blessed be his name).

I then went into the accuracy problems with **$TP**.  I told them that it was extremely error prone.  We already had very accurate data that we were providing to them.  As such, I would not sign off on the GIS aspects of **$System** until I could get an accuracy run through it.  They hemmed and hawed over this.  **$IncAnalyst** complained that there wasn't time to do this and she couldn't do it for the other numerous clients she was working for.  You have no idea how angry this made me.  You can't do an accuracy test that could save someone's life because *it takes too long*?  And I don't give two sh\*ts how many clients you have, you are doing this for us.  I didn't yell or use impolite language, but I was extremely short with them through the rest of the meeting.  Eventually **$IncManager** caved and said I'd get my accuracy analysis.

**$IncAnalyst** then stood up to give her ""presentation.""  It was nonexistent.  It was clear that she had prepared in no meaningful way.  She attempted to bring up features and explain where they fit in the project but couldn't even locate her files.  I had to stand up at the front of the room and *point out her own f\*cking features to her within her own f\*cking file system!  Are you kidding me?!*  It was there that I discovered she'd never looked at the data I'd sent to her back during the summer.  I also discovered that the data they were going to use for our municipality was outdated, super-generalized, and inaccurate.

At the end of the meeting, my anger had dissolved into more of a sinking despair.  It was clear to me that the analyst assigned to this had done virtually no work.  If we were going to get any sort of reasonable product out of this, I was going to have to take on a ton of this myself.  So I did.  I announced that I would provide the lion's share of the GIS data that would be needed for the eventual rollout of **$System**.  This included a starting point for several features that would eventually be gradually updated by the dispatchers themselves.  The reps had requested everything be sent to them within two weeks since they intended for a rollout just two months after this meeting!

When I said I'd do all this work, $IncAnalyst breathed an audible sigh of relief and said, ""Thank you.""  I wish y'all could have seen the look I gave her.

I left the meeting extremely upset.  I vented to both **$LesserIT**, who was sympathetic, as well as called and vented to **$IncLiaison**, who was less sympathetic.  I told both that I was extremely upset about **$IncAnalyst**'s lack of effort and dismissive attitude towards the importance of the project.  I told both that I wanted my complaints made clear up their chains of command.  I wrote everything down, as well.  And in as professional a manner as I could, I voiced my complaints via email to **$LesserIT** so there would be a direct record (for FOIA, if need be).  I believe I used the term ""manifestly unimpressed"" to voice my displeasure.

And after that, I worked my a$$ off getting all the GIS data put together.  Seriously, 90-hour weeks for the next two weeks.  I doubt anybody knew how much I worked, but I would be damned if I let a little one's grandma die because some lazy analyst couldn't be a$$ed to do her job and create a dispatch system that would get the authorities there in time to save her.  At 9 PM on the last day I had before the two weeks were up, I sent off every single element that I said I would create for the project.  In that same email, I reiterated that I would not sign off on it until I had been able to get an accuracy analysis and it was within an acceptable level of error.

So up next... unacceptable levels of error!  I hope you've liked this.  I'll post Part 2 up tomorrow :)

415,The Non-Working keyboard and character limits.,"Let me preface this with- I started my current job 5mos ago and I am STILL learning all the 3rd party systems. 

A LOT of our users are working from home today. I live up in Maine and we have some decent ice going. 

Actors- 

$me - DanuinKBH, the intrepid Sys & Network Admin for a regional health facility!

$FPE - Our user. (And to be honest, the users at this business are all unicorns. They are friendly, they listen, they joke with us)

$FPE calls in, we go through how I am her favorite and she really appreciates IT, especially this time of year.   
""My keyboard doesn't type anymore. I was typing in info to a case and it just stopped.""

I know she has a wireless keyboard so I ask the obvious ""Did you try new batteries?""

$FPE says ""No, because the keyboard on my laptop won't type any more either.""

""Can you move the mouse around? Maybe your laptop is just locked up?"" I ask reasonably. 

""No, I can move the mouse. Maybe I just hit a key combo that caused the keyboards to not work?"" $FPE asks in earnest curiosity. 

""I am not aware of any combo that would do that, honestly. Let's do this: Reboot the laptop and try again. Let me know how it goes."" 

""Why is it I did not think of that before I call!?"" $FPE says with a smile.

""You know your IT folks. If we are not allowed to say 'Did you turn it off and back on?' at least once a day we get depressed!""

We go ahead and hang-up. No reason to sit on the phone as I am positive this will fix it. I get an email from $FPE not 10mins later that says:  
*"" So, I told you I was working on cases. Apparently, I had filled the text box and was not allowed to add more characters. Instead of the system telling me that, it just did not allow me to add more information* ***(i.e. I perceived that my laptop and keyboard stopped working).*** 

*Might be good for you to know when other people’s brain’s stop working such as mine did!""*

I love our users.",22,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF784E80>
416,Be weary,"Hi folks, back again with tales from typewriter support.  

I suppose I'm not particularly the best judge of character when it comes to people.  You can't open them up and see how they work like you can with a typewriter.  Well, you could but you'd find yourself in some unsavory circumstances.

I had a customer come in once with a lovely German portable typewriter in need of cleaning and repair.  We had a lovely chat about all sorts of things from typewriters to fountain pens, and she gave me a cute little pocket notebook and some stickers.  I thought she seemed like a wonderful person, one of those rare individuals that actually makes you want to continue business with them.

She signed my payment contract without question or problem, and there I have two clauses listed.  Everything on there exists because I've been screwed for it in the past.  First is the $20 assessment fee, non refundable and it does not go to the final bill.  It's merely for me to take the time to strip the machine down and tinker with it to get an accurate list of problems and dial in the quote as close as possible.  Second clause, I cannot return the machine to you before you've paid!  I didn't think these would be an issue, I've had folks complain, but that's just how I need to do business.  I can't have people walk off without paying for hours of work, nor do I want to take a half hour to an hour on a machine to diagnose it only for the client to say ""no thank you"" and walk away.  I acknowledge my time has value to it.

I get down to business and start working on the typewriter.  I will refrain from stating the model, but it was a 70s era plastic shell.  The machine itself was covered in surface rust from the humidity.  It also had a handful of mechanical parts needing disassembly, repair,, and replacement parts.  All in all, the quote came out to just shy of $200.  Which I have listed as average repair price.  She responded that it was a bit high, so I cut it down by nearly half.  

The thing about me, is that I like to work within an industry standard.  I don't like halfassing projects, so while I cut the quote, I still did the work.  It amounted to about several hours of un-paid work but I figured it was worth it because she seemed nice.  I have a nasty habit of underbilling.  

She agrees to the new price and voices no further complaints.  Damn that machine came out looking like new.  Truly a fine writing instrument.  She comes by to pick it up a week after our initial scheduled date, doesn't say much, and drives off.  I figured she must have been in a hurry.  I get an email that evening from her stating that the sole reason she paid me at all was so I wouldn't hold her machine ""hostage"" as per my contract, as well as a voiced distaste that the assessment fee doesn't go towards the quoted work.

So, that was the only reason?  Ouch.  Not that it looked fantastic, actually worked, came with free parts and a ribbon, typed super well, dialed into factory specs that were decades out of alignment... she didn't voice any particular concern, but it was just one large undertone of disappointment.  I suppose she was trying to butter me up for a better price early on, not the first time someone has tried that trick but I fall for it every time.  Guess it just wasn't low enough for her.  I figured she'd maybe appreciate good workmanship, but today's society doesn't really value that much anymore.

One thing's for sure, I don't work for free.",33,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF784EE0>
417,What's Oh-See-Arrah?,"A few years ago I worked for a document processing company where most employees received scanned typed documents and read the document while manually typing it into a system. One day while troubleshooting Adobe on a PC, I asked the user if they needed the OCR button added back. This is a 20yr veteran of the company who has been in the same department the entire time.

$Me: Adobe is fixed for now, would you like me to add the OCR button back?

$User: Oh-See-Arrah? Whaaa?

$Me: Yes. The process which turns a scanned typed document into one where the text can be copied and pasted into another program.

$User: *Silence... *Gears turning, trying to calculate how much time they have wasted not using this feature. More gears turning realizing no one in the department uses this since this user trains all other users.

$User: Can you show me how this works?

I proceed to show the process and have the user go through it a few times so they can train others. 

After this call, I had to reflect for a while on what had just transpired. Did I just get some people fired? Oh no! I said with a clamoring sound. Dropping my stapler on the cold snowy ground. To all a good night, may Oh-See-Arrah always treat you right!

One of my funniest Support Storys came from there.

The Clinic was freshly rebuild and we got a couple of new doctors.

A User reports she gets a headache from the router behind her, i said okay i will look at it.

Before i go there i talked with our team lead, if he knows of any extra router in the offices, he said no.

Maybe some of the inhouse Technican mounted an Access Point in her office,.

I drove to her office and asked what was the problem, she pointed to the Lan socket behind her and said, those were giving her a headache.

I said there is nothing patched to it not even power nothing, but she insisted it gave her headache.

in the end she just placed something in front of it and TA DAH no more headache...

419,Stock Broker = My Remote Hands,"Going back in the day to the late 90s.

I was a young whippersnapper (17) starting a summer job working in the IT department of a holding company that operated a suite of businesses.  There was the CIO, the network admin, the app development guy, the PC tech, and me, the FNG.  Not a ton of end users, only about 50-70.  I started there thanks to a recommendation of my friend to her dad who was the CIO. He originally hired me to just to do shit work, but as he realized I could do more, he kept pushing more and more onto me. I loved it, to this day it's still one of my favorite jobs ever in IT, working in a room building new desktops, fixing old ones, and trying to resurrect printers from the dead.  Oh and making Macs talk to our Window NT 4 network, which wasn't really that difficult, but for some reason earned me a status as a wizard to the Mac folks.  I learned so much working in that shop.  I wish I had had a heads up on what to do when the hot accountant sits down while you're under her desk and you turn around not knowing, but that's a tale for another subreddit.

This particular case concerns a certain stock broker who I shall call Joe.  He worked in a satellite office, so I never met him during my time there.  He was known for being an ass when he called for help and he always had oddball IT requests - mainly those that would circumvent our content filters, because he ""had clients in the business and had to verify uptime."" Whatever. Not my problem to deal with. What became my problem to deal with was when he was complaining his computer was too slow. Boss man CIO came to me and said ""Hey, pull from the stock of new parts and build Joe a new machine. Builld the best you can. I'm sick of his bitching. Whatever you build better shut his ass up.""

Alrighty then boss, challenge accepted. I brought extra Doritos and Bean Dip to work the next day.

I proceeded to build him a system with one of our new Pentium MMX 200 CPUs (hah!) and gave him double the RAM we'd normally build for a newer deskop (64 MB versus 32 MB). I even gave him our best 32x CD-ROM drive, though I didn't know if he'd even use it for anything besides music.  Installed Windows, Office, the standard client apps, then left it running Prime95 over the weekend. Purred like a kitten. Mister Hot Shot Joe should be happy with this beast.

A few weeks later we got a call from Joe, complaining his computer kept rebooting. Remoted in, looked at the event logs, and fuck, sure enough the damn thing kept crashing with random errors that all pointed at memory. FUCK. It was all brand new, dammit! Must have got screwed somehow.

I told the CIO what I found. He looked at me, sighed and shook his head. ""FistbumpBroseph, where did you find that set of 64 MB of RAM?"" ""In the RAM trays boss, with all of the other new RAM we have."" ""... That was supposed to be RMA'ed. I'm guessing I forgot to do that.  Didn't you test it?""

Fuck me.  I only ran Prime95.  Not MemTest86.  FUCK.

""I ran Prime95 over the weekend and didn't have a single error.  I figured if the memory was bad it would have errored out at some point.""

""Well now you know better.  Damn.  We're going to have to get that box back and replace it, I'll get an order in.  Call Joe back and let him know. Damn kid, I thought you knew better.""

So, feeling like a piece of shit, I called up Joe and let him know what the issue was. Predictably, he proceeded to light my ass up. ""MY WORK IS TOP PRIORITY AND I CAN'T BE WTIHOUT A COMPUTER FOR GOD KNOWS HOW LONG! WHAT THE HELL KIND OF BUSINESS ARE WE RUNNING IF YOU CANNOT PROVIDE ME QUALITY!"" He went on and on. My ears had blisters.  I felt like I was 2 feet tall for only testing the CPU with Prime95 but not bothering to run MemTest86.  Fuuuuuuuuuuuck.

Went back to the bossman. Told him what he said. He smirked and said ""Well.. if you want to be a hero.. I'll have the replacement RAM shipped to his remote office. You walk him through replacing it on the phone and make it work, and I'll forgive your mistake.""

FUCKING HELL. ""Okay, fine, I'll do it.""

Three days later, Joe calls me to let me know he has the package.  ""Okay Joe, here's how it's going to go.  I'm going to give you instructions and you're going to follow them.  All you'll need to do is to unplug your box, get it on a table, make sure you have plenty of light, and get a Phillips screwdriver. Got it?""

""Okay, got it.""

I proceeded to walk this guy through the process of swapping his RAM on the phone.  Talked him through unscrewing the case and removing the cover (not like our awesome cases now where you only remove a side panel, no, it's THREE FUCKING SIDES OF THE WHOLE THING WITH TABS), popping out the defective RAM, inserting the new RAM the same way (""Line up the slots just like the old RAM Joe!""), and getting the bastard case cover back on, ""No jiggle it, I promise if you wiggle it just right it'll slide right in, just press on the sides where I told you. NO I didn't choose this case but I promise it'll fi- YEAH! It's all smooth?  Good job Joe, start putting the screws back in.""

The whole time the other IT guys in the office were listening and laughing their asses off. Totally not distracting at all.  Assholes.

Once I got him to plug the right cables back into the right ports, he finally powers it up. ""Oh, I see text! OH I see Windows! Wow, it's working! DAMN I'M GOOD! Why the fuck do we pay you guys when I could just do this shit myself??"" 

I didn't bother to answer. ""Joe, just put the old RAM back in the box the new RAM came in and have it shipped to me. Thanks for handling this on your own, you did great.""

""Yeah, I DID do great!!"" Christ.

Anyway, his box performed well and whereas I never got so much as a thank you, he was a bit more cordial to me when he called in for support issues.  I got respect from the other guys for actually getting him to do it right.  My CIO said I finally passed initiation and I could do this job.

Honestly I figured I passed that when I handled my face being unexpectedly between an accountant's legs several weeks prior, but I was wrong.  Today, looking back, it's STILL one of the toughest things I ever got someone else to do over the phone.",30,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF786040>
420,Your computer is attacking the server!,"So I used to be the IT at my family's business. I quit in 2015. I came back in 2017 but for a different job, but was asked if I ALSO wanted the IT position, I declined. Fast forward to last night(Dec 2021) and i get a text from the current IT guy. He tells me that he has shut my computer down as it was 'attacking the server' , and Kaspersky luckily blocked it. Well I recently installed 4 raspberry pis for displaying menu boards, etc. I tried to connect and couldn't so I decided to run nmap to see if maybe the ips had changed. Im not super well versed on using nmap so I wound up trying to run it several times with different options. So yeah I guess I can see why his initial response would be to think my computer had gone rogue because he didn't know that I had worked that day.

Maybe not tech support related enough, if not Im sorry",41,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF7860A0>
421,"""Oh, I'm not the IT-guy, I'm the sales guy. ""","Ever had that distinct feeling of seething anger and hatred towards a guy, only to realize it's not really his fault and you're kind of left wondering what there is left to feel at all? That was me a few weeks ago.


Quick backstory: We have sold 10 client PCs to a customer on which they had installed software we also sell. The end customer, who we'll call John, ended up not liking the software, so we were asked if we could provide something different. Demos were given and in the end they had chosen a software that was ideal for their situation. Our client's ITer, who we'll name Fred, was also present and he was noting down and asking what the installation procedures were. Their sales guy, who we'll name Dan, was there too. Mind you, I was not present at this demo, so I had no idea who anyone was or what was exactly sold. My colleague, we'll call him George, was the one present at the demo and was also handling most of their questions regarding the new software. 


Fast forward 2 months and I get a call from Dan (who I at the time didn't know wasn't their IT guy) . He said the software wasn't working properly and asked if one of us could drop by to fix it. I said that George was on holiday so if they wanted his help specifically, they'd have to wait until he came back in about 2 weeks, but if I could provide any help, I wouldn't mind doing so. A week passes with no answer so I figured they wanted to wait for George to come back.


Then suddenly, I got a call from Dan.


Dan: Hi, is this George ?

Me: No this is Tea. How can I help?

Dan: Oh, well, uh, well, can I talk to George?

Me: George is still on leave until... Next week. Is there anything I can assist you with? 

Dan: *sighs audibly* Well, our customer is saying the software isn't working at all and wants someone to come by tomorrow to fix it. 

Me: Oh, I'll need to check our schedules and see if I'm able to co-

Dan: No no, you don't understand, someone HAS to come or we'll lose this customer. You guys had better come or I'll go and find another distributor to buy our stuff from! 

Me: Is there any way for me to remotely log onto the clients and see if I can fix it that way? 

Dan: No, it's an...  *long pause*

Me: An...? 

Dan:... Closed network. So there's no internet connected to the clients. 

Me: Alright, one moment. 

I put him on hold and go into my boss his office. I explain the situation, he checks my schedule, makes a few calls and asks me if I'm willing to go there tomorrow. I say I am despite the long drive because I want to help them out. 
The customer and I agree to meet at 9 am on location. 
The next day, after a 2h long drive, I arrive on location at 9 am. Client is nowhere to be seen. I wait half an hour and I call him. He says he's on the way but that he's run into some traffic. Around 10:30 am he arrives saying he's sorry and we go inside. Mind you, I was a already annoyed at the fact that I had to wait an hour and a half after driving for 2 hours. 

We enter the building, I go to the clients and I see that the software is only installed on 1 PC. 

Me: I thought you had installed them on all the PCs already? 

Dan: Uh... Apparently not? 

Me: I was under the impression that the software wasn't working properly,  but it's not installed at all.

Dan: Ah, I didn't know that. 

Me: What do you mean you didn't know, you're the one who installed and programmed it right? 

Dan: Oh, you mean Fred! Fred's on leave until next week. I'm the sales guy who sold this system. 

Me: And he only installed the software on 1 PC? 

Dan:... Yes. 

Me: Is there a reason why he didn't install them on the other clients? 

Dan: I... I don't know actually. Our client was threatening to pursue legal action if we didn't fix it this week, so I panicked and I asked you guys to come. Can you fix it? 

So instead of spending maybe 1-2 hours troubleshooting the software, I'm stuck installing and configuring 9 PCs with this software which took me about 4-5 hours to make sure everything worked properly. 

On the exterior, I was friendly, professional and calm while answering whatever questions they had, but on the inside? Man, was I fuming. After a while I just couldn't fault the guy and the fault probably lies with Fred, so I ended up feeling... Empty. 

I left, 2h trip back, called my boss and explained the situation. He said he'd charge them a full day of on-site support. 

A week later I learned that Fred was planning on installing the software on the 9 other clients but he forgot his week of vacation was coming up, so he figured it wouldn't be a big deal to finish his work after he got back and didn't let his sales know. No idea if he got fired for it or not.

422,"Fine, take the scripts.","Sharing a bit of nostalgia from some time back.

A business bought a one-month manpower contract from my boss. The job is simple but tedious - deploy> 200 laptops with their customized Windows Vista Business SP1 image, record the serial numbers, rename the computer, join them to AD, install drivers and any additional software required and mount a bunch of network drives.

Arrived at the customer's office and was introduced to their IT person doing all the steps manually. As in, turning the laptop over to see and record the serial numbers on Notepad, renaming and joining the computers to AD using the System window and adding the network shares with the Map Network Drive option in Explorer. Watching this was aggravating, so it was time to get creative.

As a Linux user back then (I'm not one anymore - best decision ever, but that's a story for another time) with zero experience in managing and supporting Windows deployments, i started experimenting with writing BAT files on the side because I was very certain that at least some of the stuff could be automated. In the meantime their ""IT person"" was complaining of slow progress. After some trial and error, I had two crude but usable scripts ready to go on day 3. The first script would create a persistent map for the required network drives, rename the computer, join it to AD and then reboot the laptop in that order. The second script retrieves the serial number and the new computer name, map a network share to the IT department's shared folder, append that info into a .txt file I created for this purpose and then remove this mapping.

The drivers and additional software still needed manual installation, but it was nothing compared to the time saved and the laptops all done by the end of the second week. Since there was still two weeks left to the contract, I was re-deployed as their general IT support (isn't that what the ""IT person"" there is paid to do?) . Noticed a pattern after a few days: common problems there include network shares and shared printers randomly disconnecting and refusing to re-connect. Out comes another two scripts: one to remove all mapped network drives and then reconnect to them again, another to do the same for the printers. Thus I never had to leave my seat for a good portion of the time. Just take the fault call, get the details, make minor changes to my scripts, remote into the user's computer, load the scripts, check the results and out I go.

When the contract finally concluded, the ""IT person"" insisted that I leave the scripts behind because they were considered company property. Didn't want to raise a stink and complied. Boss wasn't pleased but I didn't care. After all, if a person who worked on Windows computers their entire life couldn't be bothered to learn basic automation while a third-party contractor with minimal Windows sysadmin experience was able to crank out a bunch of scripts in three days, it's a safe bet that this fellow wouldn't have the knowhow to edit and use them effectively.",129,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF786160>
423,1? Did you restart? 2 is everything plugged in? 3 ???,"Ah, the joys of work from home with your spouse. So, their laptop went danger pillow and we decided it was best not to feed power through it.  Unfortunately, it requires unscrewing the case to remove, so taking it out and just running on AC was not an option.

So, she gets approval to grab a tower from the office to use while the new laptop ships in for replacement.  The tower has one HDMI and one displayport, while the docking station was two displayport connections. I grab a spare HDMI and connect the tower to the two monitors.

When the replacement comes in, my spouse complains about not having any icons, and nothing is visible when programs start.  I leave my desk to troubleshoot (Her boss still has not approved the $300 / hour, 2 hour minimum charge schedule I tried to negotiate) and, sure enough I cannot see any active windows, although the taskbar shows the programs launched.

Scrolling over the thumbnail for the display properties window, it shows that the computer is showing 4 monitors.  The work setup is only supposed to be two, but the built in display for the laptop would explain a third, not sure why four. I disconnect the docking port and everything works correctly on just the laptop. I was about to move one monitor directly into the laptop to troubleshoot that connection when I notice there are three connections in the docking port.  My spouse when unplugging the temporary tower plugged everything back into the docking station, including the extra HDMI connection, one monitor was connected twice and could only display one connection and the display selected as primary happened to be the one it didn't display.

So, I guess when asking if everything is plugged in, I should also check that the appropriate peripherals are plugged in.",29,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF7861C0>
424,When the error is maybe a bad UI?,"I work integration support for a healthcare software company. I worked with a customer on Friday to verify that data regarding patients is flowing to our cloud server as expected. I told them that I'd keep the case open until today for them to verify the dashboard they look at looks fine and to let me know if they have any further questions/concerns.

Customer emails me today with two screenshots along with the question ""What do I do about this error?"" I look all through the screenshots and there's no error anywhere. There's a shot of the interface engine (what I'm most familiar with) and nothing out of the ordinary is there. Then there's a shot of the dashboard, which I never look at because my area of concern is getting data from them to us. Not what it looks like once the dashboard shows the breakdown of the data.

I email her asking what error she's seeing. She highlights the word ""Error"" at the top of a pane where the field says ""No data available in table"". Next to it there is a similar pane showing unprocessed jobs and again, ""No data available in table"".

I double check with one of the folks who looks at these dashboards every day to make sure I'm reading this right because I know that the data has all uploaded.

425,I'm now the printer guy because co-worker can't boil water correctly,"Another thread here sparked a repressed memory, and I had to share.

I was working in a (non-IT) office administration job, but I was the de facto IT guy. It was a terrible, thankless job, but it gave me the experience to get where I am now, and most of the coworkers were cool.

**MOST**

One day, I had to leave in a hurry and the main MFD was low on black toner, so I showed one of my coworkers where the toner was and left.

Two things to explain: 

1. This MFD had the easiest toner refilling I've ever seen. It was literally three steps beginning to end, and the toner came straight out and went right back in without any kind of finangling.
2. This particular coworker was an idiot of the highest order. He had an IQ to rival that of a knock-off Chia Pet, and this was well-known in the office. He was over 40 and had zero discernible, marketable skills of any kind. The kind of coworker that is just demoralizing to be around, because somehow you both get paid the same amount.

Like I said, I was in a hurry and absolutely had to leave. I had a tiny bit of faith in the aforementioned coworker.

I come in the next morning to find black toner all over the carpet in front of the printer. He had somehow decided that opening the toner cartridge itself was a part of the change process, and hadn't bothered to clean it up when he spectacularly failed.

The result? 

No, the coworker didn't get in trouble.

I got in trouble for not staying to change the toner myself, and was told to not let it happen again.

Oh, and I had to clean up the carpet.",188,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF786280>
426,The day i tripped a panic alarm at a customers office,"This is a lot of years ago, i went to a customer office -it was like a union/mutual savings office- to check the network(i'm not exactly sure on the specifics).

It was a small street corner office and obviously not built with computers or network in mind as part of the network(i think the ADSL router) was in the bathroom, in the process of following the wiring there i see this nondescript weird ""button-like"" thing(a rectangular central part with raised guards on the side) behind the sink pillar near the floor.

I was young... and wasn't quite versed in alarm technology back then, and you know... WTH is that thing doing there on the floor... ¿with a wire going to it?, ¿a thermal sensor?, ¿a sensor of some sort?, the curiosity was too much and i couldn't help myself and pushed it thinking it was a cap and the sensor was behind it, but no, it was a button....

Nothing happens and i go about continuing the work there, some minutes later the police drops and everyone is wide eyed and they go about identifying everyone there, they didn't believed i was a tech at first and thought i was the robber, after some minutes of convincing and ""oh yeah, i pushed it didn't know what it was"" with a red face

Yeah... what i pushed was the silent alarm panic button so if you get held hostage or tied in the bathroom you push it, they laughed a lot at work after that.

427,Where the hell is it!,"Back in the mid to late aughts, I would spend my day driving from client to client solving whatever ailed them. Primarily the 5-50 person office businesses, though there were many outliers. 

One day I got a call from a new client. They were a referral, as almost all my clients are, and I had never been there before. The issue was, and I quote:

“Our network sucks”

I arrive, and sure enough, their network does suck. Pings time out, print jobs fail to arrive, the web will work, then not. They had a few dozen workstations spread throughout various rooms in their building, with an actual network closet. A completely unlabeled network closet. 

Everything in the network closet checks out, and after doing some due diligence, I figured there’s got to be a rogue device in the network causing issues. So I start unplugging jacks. Eventually I find that unplugging a certain jack fixes the issue. Great!  Now I just have to figure out where the hell in the building that line goes. 

Everyone had left, so I can’t just walk around asking who lost connectivity. So I proceed to wander the building, mapping their entire network. 

After a whole lot of crawling around and sneezing, I discover the culprit. Somebody had plugged a cheap $20 hub from Best Buy into the network port in order to add a new printer to the network. 

Extending their network with a cheap hub instead of a switch caused their entire network to go down, and to pay me for hours to fix the issue. I replaced it with a new switch, and all was well with the world.

The hub had worked for a while, but eventually the toll had to be paid. 

But they loved me after that, so it worked out for me.",24,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF786340>
428,"Tales from the NOC side, part 1","I'd been a Support Engineer for several years and was the subject matter expert on integrations. I helped customers implement our product, then collaborated with Engineering and Product Management when issues came up.

My US-based (but European owned) company acquired a German competitor. I always felt like the European execs treated American workers like colonial subjects, as I'd witnessed this at 2 previous companies. The CEO and his cronies would roll in and accost workers with ""Oi! You! What are you doing to make money for me company?"" Meanwhile, the German managers took over every facet of our decision making process and culture with a sour grin.

My newly-appointed German manager (Grimace) relocated to the US and brought an underling (Special-K) who was my counterpart at the acquired company. I was given the unenviable job of training Grimace, Special-K, and 10 of their European account reps on our product. Some memorable dialog between us went something like:

**Special-K**: How do you create an API key hash with ""HMAC""?   
**Me:** Here's the solution, I wrote it in Python and added comments so you can see how it works.  
**Special-K**: That is very complicated. I do not know Python. I only know PERL.  
**Me** (15 minutes later): OK, I wrote an example in PERL. Let me know if you have any questions.   
**Special-K**: Oh, that's nice. I am too biz-zee. Maybe I will be free next week.

**Me**: How's the progress on the task for Big Company?   
**Special-K**: It is good, I am almost done, but I have questions. Let's have a conference call.   
**Me**: It might be easier for you to refer to the step-by-step directions I documented, and follow up if you have any questions.   
**Special-K**: I read them, but do not understand. Let's have a conference call.   
...   
Our company used web conferencing software that couldn't record (this predates Zoom by a number of years). During the calls, Special-K would blather on about nothing. It was mostly inane stuff, like graffiti he'd seen or the greasiest bratwurst he'd ever eaten. Any written correspondence with Special-K consisted of 1-3 word responses that resembled grunts made in between quaffs of beer. Since he wasn't working, I understood why he didn't want to leave a paper trail. 

Creating agendas and outlines did nothing to improve the situation. I gave up on the direct support and continued to create documentation. 
...  
**Grimace**: (Weeks later) Special-K, are you done with the task for Big Company?   
**Special-K**: Yes, kind of. Almost, but I do not know how to do <fill in the blank>   
**Grimace**: Why didn't you train Special-K to <fill in the blank>   
**Me**: I documented everything he needs here, here, and here. We also had conference calls about it.  
**Special-K**: Ach, yes. But I was biz-zee! Ferdinand needed me to sweep dust from underneath the server rack.  
**Grimace**: OK. Keep up the good work, Special-K.   
...  
More weeks pass, task is still not done and Big Company writes an angry response with bad feedback about Special-K in a ticket. CEO pounces on ticket, Grimace takes ticket ""offline"" and persuades CEO that all is good. Special-K emerges unscathed.   
...   
Repeat 15x. That's right, this happened *many* times.

From then on, Grimace handed every incoming project to me. I was told that Special-K had some super secret job to do and wouldn't be joining training sessions or assisting at all. If I went on vacation, every ticket that came in was waiting for me when I got back.

Meanwhile, the account reps in Germany requested that I be flown in to assist them in person. I had a good rapport with them, and this would expedite their fulfillment goals. They were trying to retain some large customers during a migration to our platform. The old product supported a number of useful features that ours did not. It was chaos. Grimace and his boss (Finkle) flatly denied their request. If the company was low on cash, I'd understand. However, employees were traveling freely to the US (we were located in a tourist destination) and Germany for work trips with a healthy dose of PTO thrown in. I figured Grimace did this out of spite and marched on.

The tense, awkward meetings weren't only reserved for me. I witnessed some passive aggressive dick measuring contests that went beyond cultural misunderstandings. They were often punctuated with rhetorical affirmatives. For example,

**Grimace**: The continuum transfunctioner will be included in the next release, YES?   
**Keenan Feldspar**: No, the next release will not include that.   
**Grimace**: But the continuum transfunctioner is needed by my Big Customers A, B, and C. YES?   
**Keenan Feldspar**: We would need to prioritize it on the upcoming roadma--   
**Grimace**: You say ""NO"", but mean ""YES"", Keenan. I want you to say ""YES.""   
**Keenan Feldspar**: No, actually, ...   
**Grimace**: This is a problem, Keenan. YES?

So it was cobra vs mongoose, board shorts vs lederhosen, and flip flops vs Birkenstocks mit socks.

I really wanted out. I was ready to leave the company, but I'd invested a number of years there and had a good reputation among the grunts. Why should I leave because of these guys, right? I knew one manager (Costanza) who was intelligent, well-meaning, and wanted me to join his team. He was probably the only manager at the company who was honest. However, I'd have to train a team of NOC engineers in Bangalore on everything I knew, and then some. This would be an new bag of worms...

429,But I don’t want to swap toner!,"So another story from a school I used to work in. One of the projects I had rolled out was to remove half our printers and automation of toner replacements to departments.

When a printer hit a 20% toner alert it would trigger an automated system that would order more toner for that printer, and our printer provider would ship new toner. For example if IT hit 20% Black Toner suddenly a new Toner would be shipped to the School ATTN IT Department. The purpose of this was that it meant that IT didn’t need to store and delivery toner. One flow on from this was that all staff were shown how to change toner, open flap, pull out plastic ribbon and install. Easy.

This came with a policy that the Executive signed off on that IT would only Train staff on toner replacements, not do actually replace them. Since IT weren’t needed to order/swap toner we wouldn’t do it for you. If you submitted a ticket asking for more toner it was automatically closed informing the teacher to check their store room and swap the toner themselves. Reminding them a new toner was on it’s way. Each department always had a spare in their office, and only once in that time did we run into an issue where a department went through a whole toner in 1 day.

Though this one teacher believed swapping toner was above her. She learnt sending in tickets doesn’t help so would call us. This is a combination of multiple calls.

IT: Hello, how can we help you?

Self Entitled Teacher (SET): The toner is out. Come and replace it.

IT: Sure, are you there right now, we can send someone over now to show you how to swap the toner.

SET: No. I don’t swap toner that is an IT job.

IT: As you know, IT only shows you how to do it. Staff must swap their own toner.

SET: Ok. Come here now.

I got over to the office and like she would sometimes do she had taken off leaving a note saying something like “I had an urgent student issue to attend, please swap toner.” Since myself and the rest of Helpdesk were well aware of her methods we just updated the note added… please see guide above printer. Each printer had a series of photos showing them how to change toner. I even checked there was spare toner in her staff room.

I went back to IT, created a ticket and noted; *Teacher was not in office. Please see guide attached and install toner. If you would like IT please let us known a time you are around so we can teacher you.*

This was the afternoon so I logged off and went home. Next morning I come in to a yelling email, that she had been unable to printer, it was all my fault and as a result the world was ending. The entire Executive was CC’d and made out that I was a horrible person.

I calmly responded that we had attended right away, made sure instructions where they and even attached them to a ticket. Stated when we arrived we saw a note saying she was attending an urgent student issue. And also included references to a dozen other tickets about her refusal to follow the guide.

Within half an hour I got a singular reply from one of the Executive Member thanking me and to close the ticket, they will deal with it themselves.

I found out later that the Executive were sick of her Self Entitled Actions, and that she was getting an official warning over this. The big reason, there had been no ‘Urgent Student Issue’ and she had gone to get a coffee, her lying about student issues had been a step too far.

Ironically with no further help required she suddenly could swap toner.",102,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF786400>

432,Pluggable Clipboard,"This story happened in 2015 and is one of my most hilarious support cases. I worked in first Level Support that day and a team assistant (called TA in this text) called in on our support hotline.

TA: ""Can you please help me with my clipboard? I think it is broken, I can copy, but the paste drop-down stays disabled""

Me: ""Maybe there are some permissions missing to copy the files. Can you tell me the destination folder?""

TA: ""I don't think that this is the problem, I can create and edit files there.""

Nevertheless I checked the permissions, of course. She was right. My first thoughts were, that she really tried to solve it on her own, because without googling she would not have used the term ""clipboard"". Because she worked in the same building I agreed to come over get a coffee and fix the problem. At her office I asked her to show me the problem.

TA: ""Look, I select this file, click with the right button on it and choose copy.""

Everything ok.. so far. But then she plugged off her mouse from her computer, walked to another computer, plugged the mouse in and right clicked on an opened folder. 

TA: ""See? Paste is disabled"" 

In 2015, where clipboard history was not a thing in Windows, I laughed so hard, I had to buy her a cupcake for atonement. She really thought, that the clipboard was stored on her mouse, because she clicked it with the mouse.",101,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF786520>
433,"tech support, its not just for computers","I was just a by stander for this incident but it was interesting twist to my tech support experience.  

I was in England with my wife on vacation a few years ago.  We had to take a bus from Heathrow to the town we were staying in after we arrived.  The bus driver was a very nice middle aged lady who gave us all a running commentary on the ride down.  She was like something out of British TV comedy, but completely charming.

We got to the first bus stop, a small station in a town near to where we were headed.  She shuts the bus off since this is not the U.S. where you always leave engines running all the time.  After boarding the new folks, she goes to start the engine and nothing happens.  Like most modern machines, the bus has lots of computers so she goes through some reset steps, keeping up a running commentary for the passengers.  Nothing works.

She turns around and tells us she going to have to call Tech Support!    Wow, tech support for bus, well why not?

We can only hear her side of of the conversation of course, she tells whoever is on the phone, yes did reset X, yes she tried step Y, and work-around Z.  Then her voice suddenly rises in tone and volume, no she's not going to do that!  She's a driver, not a mechanic.  She starts scolding the support person, imagine suggesting something unreasonable to your Mom or favorite aunt.  My wife and I, who both had a lot of experience supporting computer users, are about falling out of our seats laughing.  Anyway, she's totally reading the riot act to whoever is on the phone, who is probably wishing he'd never suggested the final step.

Driver tells the support person to dispatch a mechanic, AND a replacement bus, and stop instructing her to do things she's not supposed to do.  Apparently the support person decided do just that.   Driver lady stands up and proceeds to tell us all the things they wanted her do, which of course, she had already tried, and finally, the support person wanted her to disconnect the batteries, let the bus sit for some amount of time, re-connect the batteries, and see if that worked.

I'm thinking, this is the UK, everyone is likely in a union and it sounds like they were asking a driver to do ""mechanic's work"".   I don't know for sure.  Plus she doesn't have any tools.   

While we were waiting for the next bus, I asked the driver about our bags since I would have to get switched over to the replacement bus.  ""Oh, don't worry love, I already pulled them out and we'll get them loaded for you"".   

We had a wonderful time on the trip and had fantastic experiences with all the people we had to deal with.

434,In defense of tech support...,"My wife and I were visiting family when my manager sent a frantic email asking for support with an internal application I'd been involved with. I tried to contact the useless lead engineer several times, but he didn't respond. I was worried about being laid off, so I did the work from my mobile, despite being in a different country. Navigating a well known cloud provider's portals via IOS? Not fun. Giving answers to an indifferent Product Manager because the lead engineer is AWOL? Less so. For the rest of the trip, I had a nagging sense this was going to backfire on me. And it did.

Despite resolving the situation, the lead engineer and his manager blamed me. Said I was reluctant to cede my project to their team and claimed I wouldn't delegate responsibility (wrong! I was actually glad to be rid of it). Here's an excerpt of our discussion:

**Me**: I called the lead engineer 4 times, but he didn't pick up!   
**Lead Engineer's Manager**: He didn't recognize the number. I would never pick up the phone if I didn't recognize the number.   
**Me**: I have a US phone number, called 4 times, and there was an ongoing platform issue. Given this context, it would seem prudent to answer your mobile.   
**Lead Engineer's Manager**: I don't see it that way. You're still wrong.   
**Me**: :(

This is how the company worked. Engineering managers could come up with ridiculous excuses and were always believed. Her boss, the CTO, calls me in to play the blame game. I had spent hours preparing my defense (instead of working), as I wasn't going to be their scapegoat. I suppose I should've asked why I had to defend myself at all.

CTO grills me alone. I calmly explain what happened, provide a chronological outline, and include links to all of the documentation I'd created. CTO concedes that I was not at fault, then sends a bullshit email to me, my manager, my manager's manager, and the lead engineer's manager promising to look into the lead engineer's lack of action. Yet nothing was ever done, it was a kangaroo court. No apologies, no follow ups from anyone. They never even thanked me for helping out during my time off.

I began looking for another job and put up with my manager for a couple more months. Updated my resume while at work. Called in sick several times to interview in person. Did one interview while still at work. Just walked out and met with the hiring manager during my lunch break. I can't begin to describe how satisfying it was to LEAVE this toxic place. They seemed surprised when I put in my 2 week notice. I worked (snoozed) from home the entire time. During my exit interview, HR asked where I was going and how much I would be paid. I politely declined to answer.",64,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF7865E0>
435,Tales from Acme Support - The one where HP thinks I'm crazy,"Yes, this is a tale of high expectations and assuming just a little bit too much  

Mission: Upgrade ESXi to the latest supported version (6.5 at the time) on the HP prod cluster

I had done a preflight upgrade in the dev environment which passed the automated upgrade with flying colors.

Simple enough right?

Wrong!  

Kicked off the upgrade through vCenter and [Murphy says](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i7PiXSgbwg) \- surprise! 

\*Upgrade fails\*

Error: Disk space has changed!    
Can't write needed data outside of partition!  

Wot?

Why does it try to go outside of the ~~environment~~ the partition?

So we roll back and shut down and pause until Monday   
I pull the offending flashdrive and replace it with a newer better and faster one. 

\*Upgrade fails\*  
Boot disk not found!    
Why Murphy??? Whyyy???

I had tried to manually build ESXi at this point in the hopes to join the cluster and decommission the orphaned node and it was fighting back at every turn. 

Gave up called HP, ran through the troubleshooting in a very thick middle eastern accent by the rep... not me. 

Have you tried turning them off and back on again?  
Yes

Another host?  
Yes, same issue

Firmwares updated?   
Firmwares are good :) 

\*More stuff here I can't remember\*

Most of it made sense, but then he kept repeating how the drive was too big, I'm thinking the local datastore along for the ride, which are kind of important to store VM's on for the initial migration, no?

$Rep - No, not those hard drives, de you-ess-bee drive!  
$Me - Wait, no... it can't be, the flashdrive is *too* big? Really?

I scrounge in the desk and find a 2gb drive, ironically it was HP-branded... 

Loaded the ISO and it worked!

436,The psycho with the weed and knives,"I used to work at a company that did on-site remote services for residential clients.  We get calls from random people wanting something fixed at their house for a premium.  Usually people are really happy to see me as I spend a lot of time catering and being really nice to their needs.  Anyway we get a call and a wealthy client (has a mansion) needed help with his computer.  I think nothing of it and go over to his house.

I start talking to him and the first thing I realized was that he was very angry about something.  You could tell by his tone. Usually what I do in this type of situation is I let them know that I got them taken care of and that they can ease their worries (or just being sympathetic to their issue).  Unfortunately this person had some sort of issue with his lawyers and he wanted me to make me a word document.  


""SIT DOWN. SIT DOWN RIGHT THERE! YEAH! RIGHT THERE!""

I sat down at his office, it was very opulent but the monitor was raised up uncomfortably high where I would need to look up to see what I'm typing on the monitor. Generally slight discomfort was common.  A lot of people really don't spend that much time on their computer, especially people who would call us.

Me: ""Okay sir what would you like me to do?""

Client: ""I WANT YOU... I mean... I WANT YOU TO... SEND SOMETHIN' TO MY LAWYER! TYPE THIS! TYPE! TYPE THIS NOW!""

He was getting more exacerbated by the minute as he was talking about his lousy lawyer and instructing me what he wanted me to do.  I was scrambling to do what he was asking me to because he was very scatter brained.  He was yelling right next to me, clearly angry.

Client: ""TYPE!""  
I had a word document opened ready to type what he was saying.  
Client requested me to type: ""YOU.... ARE.... FIRED!!!!! HENSEFORTH... Can you make it any bigger? YEAH.  and BOLD! BOLD IT! 72 POINT FONT! YES! YESSSS!""

During this moment I was asking questions going back and forth, usually regarding the word document and emailing it.  Guy only had Windows Mail and Wordpad.  I was saying something regarding that but I'm not sure exactly what I was in the middle of saying... but it was something like this:

Me: ""Sir did you want me to...""

Client: ""REEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHH!!!!""

He screamed right in the middle when I was asking a question. Like, not his regular yelling or anger toward his lawyers. He just screamed without prompt right next to me with bulging eyes.  I stared at him wide-eyed pretty terrified at this point, we were quiet for a good 5 seconds after he screamed.  I'll never forget it, because it was so out of nowhere. This was when I became genuinely terrified of my own safety.

Client: ""Can you grab my glasses out of that box right there?""

I went over to grab the glasses after I feel like he calmed down from his rage-filled scream and I opened the box to see pills, a knife, some weed.  This was very strange as clients NEVER would show you their weed. Or even a knife.  (Was a bit worried of the knife, but he didn't make any sudden moves.) Everything was prim and proper at our company and we just wouldn't be dealing with that.  I was pretty terrified at this point, so I did everything I could to wrap up the appointment, took the money and immediately bolted where I told my boss that I would never be assisting that guy again.

""It simply isn't worth the money boss.""   The company subsequently fired him as a client.  


TL;DR:  Went to crazy rich guy's house and he was super angry and eventually screamed in my ear out of nowhere making me scared for my life. I left never servicing him again. Company fired him as a client.",25,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF7866A0>

438,"It can't be that simple, can it?","I work as helpdesk for an MSP. I was given a project to install a software for all users of a new client we just onboarded, and during one remote session the user mentioned that they have another issue that needs attending to that their previous IT was unable to resolve.

The user mentioned that this request took several days of trying and after many days wasted they decided to just give up and accept that it can't be done.

Naturally I would brace myself for a potentially difficult task considering that their own in house IT who is assumingly familiar with their environment couldn't resolve the issue. Sometimes you have a ticket that is a simple request then they mention another issue that you had no time to prepare for.

So the user explains what he is trying to accomplish in great detail, I am assuming that because it was so troublesome to figure out before that he wanted to make it as clear as possible. What did the request turn out to be? He wanted to map a SharePoint document library to his file explorer.

From his first sentence I thought ""okay there must be more to it than this, it cannot be this simple.."" I was expecting that upon trying to sync the document library it would produce an error or something of that nature.

Lo and behold, upon showing him the sync button within a SharePoint document library and it tested to work with no issue, he started laughing almost histericaly. You can tell by his laugh how much stress and effort was spent on this simple task with the previous IT that to find out how simple the solution is could not be held in. He told me that the excuse of their previous IT was that he specializes in Apple products and is not so familiar with windows machines.

As much as I don't want to bash the previous IT, I just don't logically understand how you can get a job like that without being able to resolve an issue that a simple Google search would have taken care of. It really made me think that if people like this are getting hired, then I should have no problem moving out of helpdesk",40,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF786760>

440,Just your typical mass-scale infection.,"I'll set up the scene as best as i can:

I was one of two people fielding helpdesk support for a very large client. They subcontracted their L1 support to our actual employer, a small call centre where generally everyone was forced to support a myriad of clients I was lucky enough to dedicate myself to one client only, but that was becaus we were a two-person team (me, and some intern that rotated every 3 months) to field all the calls, and receive all the support inquires for this said client. close to 2000 users on two main locations with about another 1000 in satellite locations all over the world. This basically mwans we were swaamped all the time, and we were on the hook 10 hours a day, 5 days a week. This means that whenever a large-scale outage happened, we would absolutely be destroyed. And since we were L1, and outsourced, we'd receive the blame for all the downtime, despite being largely unprepared to support this.

With this background information laid off, we can now look at the story, proper.

It all started one Monday morning. One of our problem users was having their usual problems, which usually involved six AD account resets in the span of 3 hours. However, this particular bit of information sparked some interest on me. They were getting filtered out by Google. So he couldn't google up his favorite newspaper, i mean, do important extranet business.

We, as lowly L1 minions, were very limited onto what we could do. But one of the things we could do is clear all of the internet browsing related items from Internet Options on Windows, then on any affected browsers. And ironically, that worked. the blockage issues stopped. Or so we thought.

I logged the ticket, appended a call transcript, assigned to ourselves, and closed the ticket. All was fine with the world.

Until it wasn't.

This user came back later, again with the same issue, seems like every time they restarted the machine the issue would persist. Since we were L1, we did not have access to adminsitrator-level accounts, so our hands were tied. we checked the computer, saw no abnormal processes going on, and we reset the cookies once more. Log ticket, set as duplicate from parent, close, solve with the same resolution.

Repeat this for Monday and Tuesday. Wednesday was starting to get a bit more suspicious, with the calls being more frecuent. Concurrently, the department this user came from were busy figuring something out with their mailboxes. By the end of the day, i suspect something must be going on with the network, or maybe there's a rogue device. I ping L2 about it by escalating the latest ticket on the saga with all the info about the parents.

Cue Thursday, and a telephonic ass-chewing from the head of IT for being innefective and being unable to find the root cause and to step it up and to stop doing the same fix again and again. I bring up with L2 we have no administrative rights. We can't do anything but things the user can do themselves. And clearly something is seriously wrong with that user. For the next 5 working days, the process is as follows: Get multiple calls of this user, field their respective tickets, merge them and send them to L2, Networking, or Security. Absolutely nothing gets done and our tickets get bounced back with snappy responses to just fix it. This continues until the end of the week, with me begging L2 and Neworking why is there a serious problem on that department network and if there's any reasons why their outbound IPs are getting flagged. With no luck.

The next week starts as the last one ended, taking care of that particular user for the totality of the day. However, something else starts to happen that piques my interest. Finally, something that is NOT the same issue over and over again. People are starting to get their mailboxes go awry, exchange takes forever to download new mail, and """"old mail"""" is being delivered again, because email is for chumps, these people talk amongst themselves about these old mails. Turns out this would be an interesting factor for later. We proceed by erasing these duplicate mails, fixing and compacting their OST's and PST's and life moves on. We are not really allowed to look at people's mail even while remoting, so we rely on our users to know what they want deleted before doing so. 

By Friday of week 2 we get the attention of L2... because we were doing absolutely nothng apparently, and these issues weren't getting solved. At this time, we start seeing other users getting the same error as our probem user had the week prior, they are starting to get blocked by google.

Finally, on Monday, our issues start to be taken seriously, and Networking is finally checking the problem out beause at last the outbound traffic is starting to get a tiny bit OUT OF control and they have to look at it. By around this time, we actually get a call about the mailboxes again, and the old mail again. Except, the user of this call doesn't have anyone to talk to nearby, so they opened the mail to find the title of the email, the body of the email, and the enclosed attachments were all different, but they were all named after things that were sent previously, except with a few more links formatted on the body text. we check the sender, and lo and behold, it's forged. We are getting a mixture of hyper-targetted attacks and clearly a breach of information, as at the very least mail is being read and contact lists are being exfiltrated. We ask the user not to open any attachments or click any links, and to contact us when they get more of these.

Turns out that, our little two man team is fielding so many calls about google blockages and emails that we are not doing other calls and users are complaining, and our metrics are falling! Awesome!. This of course gets L2 angry. We tell them we're escalating all of this to security since clearly something is not right. and to PLEASE look at it. The penny drops, to us, at least, that at the time where users get blocked by google, we find a lot of fake emails being sent to users of this department, and now out of it.

It's outright pandemonium. Finally, after lunch of Friday of week 3, all our tickets dissapear, and securrity is taking a good look at the issue. The issue is finally over, or so we thought.

Cue monday of week four. And early in the morning we start getting calls from an adjacent department mentioning all their shares are busy. We ask the user to reboot, and to our surprise, once they reboot, they can access their shares alright, but all the data is gone. Recent from our security scare, we ask if they opened any suspicious mail, and sure enough, they received an old mail, with an old excel, with a newer modified date, the user dutifully replaced the old file with the new one, on the network share, then opened it, and allowed macros. Next thing we know everything was gone. L2 finally took us seriously when we escalated the ticket, and, as far as we know, they had tape backups from Friday so all people lost was one day of work.

We never knew what was going on but the emails stopped and google lifted the blockages. From what I could piece together, this problem user at the beginning got infected by a hypertargeted malicious emaiil, that got over their address book and sent mails to everyone and their mother, alongside doing some outbound requests i'll never have enough info on. because this particular department was phone based, they didn't have much in the name of network shares, so the infection was mostly controlled. other than everyone on that department sending their address book more mails like that. The few emails that managed to escape out were either filtered, or removed by savvier users.

Honestly, the only takeaway i got from this story is that i was incredibly naive ( happened like a month onto my position ), and i could've perhaps looked onto that problem user's mail to see if anything was fishy. The other takeaway is that L2 didn't take us seriously at the time, and they just took us a little bit more seriously after the fact.

The takeaway i wish the users got would be to properly screen their email, and try to watch out for attachments and phising attempts.

End note: This happened around 2017. I've held up for this story for 4 years in hopes that my former client has fixed their issues already. Despite having worked there for 3 years, work there was traumatic enough that only really this one story remains somewhat intact on my memory, but details are fuzzier than i'd like, and i probably remember it due to the intense ass-chewing from L2 for trying to do our job to fix this thing. I am well aware i am overly verbose for something that can be summarized as ""Malignant Email goes Nyoom"".  However i do hope you enjoyed this regardless, and apologies for the length.",31,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF786820>
441,Colleague and her brainfart with new microwave,"I no longer work tech support but I am the only young guy at a workplace of 50+y old people so I still end up being asked to fix/setup things. 

We got a new microwave today, and when I got to work, my colleague was visibly upset, brought me to the kitchen where I could see the brand new culprit and manual pages all over. 

“We got this new microwave today, I plugged it in, and it says to set up time, but I guess it got stuck in the set up phase. It shows 14:25 all the time, the time does not change and I followed the manual but it does nothing at all! I tried to call them but ofcourse they are too busy and nobody is answering so I wrote them an email but I guess they will take a year to reply. I tried to unplug it to reset it but that did not help. It heats up water just fine, I tried that, but even when heating it still only shows the 14:25, not the time left.” 

I said ok, let me take a look and reached behind the microwave to unplug it when she said:

“No that´s the kettle, I left the oven unpluged trying to reset it” 

I stopped, look at the microwave, looked at her, looked closer on the display, moved my finger to the corner of it and looked deep into her eyes as I proceeded to pull the sticker with 14:25 written on it from the display. 

God, she must have felt stupid, but we laughed it off. To be fair to her, the sticker was really convincing and it fooled me at first too when I was assuming the microwave was plugged in.

I bet she is really happy now that nobody at customer support picked up her phonecall.",46,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF786880>
442,"Company Administration/Reception hasn't setup Out of Offices, demands IT come back and do it for them.","Another story... this time from corporate not Education.

This time I was working for a company that like some shutdown for 2 weeks over Christmas. When this happens each department has a procedures manual to follow that shows them how to set Voicemails, Email Replies etc. And includes what to say.

We are talking last day before I and Helpdesk head off, and as we are powering down our machines for a long deserved IT 2 week break. We actually close IT during this time, no upgrades, maintenance or Helpdesk. Myself and one other keep an eye on any server/network alerts.

*Ring Ring*

Me: Hello, IT.

Reception: Hey, we are leaving can you please set our out of offices and change our voicemails.

I scream internally... you see we were all heading to the same party. They know the time it starts just like we do and assumes that we will do their work since they haven't done it yet.

Me: Sorry, we have already logged off and shutdown our machines. Please follow the supplied *Holiday Shutdown Guide.* It explains everything you need to do.

Reception: We have shut ours down to, you will need to do it.

Me: So turn yours back on. Setting the out of office and voicemails is not a IT job but an Admin job. 

Reception: But we've already turned our gear off. So it's just easy for you and we can get going.

Me: I'm sorry, but if we handle your request suddenly all departments will be asking us to handle theirs. You have the guide, please follow it.

They ended the call without a good bye, we finished up signing out and left.

Two weeks later we get in and Helpdesk inform me of a ticket from Reception asking us to handle their out of office. I casually respond just tell them to follow part 2 of the guide they followed two weeks ago.

Helpdesk: No... the ticket is from 2 weeks ago, sent at 3pm asking us to set it up and blaming IT for it not being done before the party.

Despite being refreshed from 2 weeks off, and not having to had even come in I still responded to their ticket CCing their boss and mine. They claimed the system didn't work and they were asking for help but we refused so we could go to the party.

I responded stating it did work, and proved it did. And showed the call log of their time and date or request. Stating that they called at say 12pm, the process takes ten minutes to complete (including testing) but they keycard shows them leaving the building at 12:03pm, and factoring in the call there didn't even attempt.

Reception got in the shit, especially when they checked the reception voicemails that had a few angry customers who left voicemails without hearing back or knowing that we were closed. It ruined my relationship with the receptions staff, though in this case I couldn't be bothered keeping them happy.",166,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF7868E0>
443,The Legend of the Chocolate Q,"As requested in another TFTS post by  u/throwawaysamplesize9 i bring for your afternoon enjoyment, the Legend of the Chocolate Q

Once upon a time and many employers ago, i was an on site desktop support tech for a manufacturing company.  We occupied a windowless Workbench slash Office slash Storage area with a  single door to enter that you could never really close or the place heated up pretty quickly or, in the case of Chimichanga Thursdays, the extra exhaust was necessary for HSE reasons. Regardless, we three were easily accessible from anyone walking down the hallway in this part of the admin building.  This meant that it was common for users to just pop in the door and strike up a friendly conversation with phrases along the lines of ""Hello TheTechJones my whatever isn't working, can i leave it with you and pick it up later?"" We even had a small shelf that was near the door that said users took to using as a drop off point (keep in mind that none of these actions were allowed or encouraged but we lacked support from mgmt so adapt and survive).  

But i digress, this is a story about a phone after all. So on this day, a user walks in and says his phone doesn't turn on anymore. So my colleague turns to him and takes the Moto Q from the guy and holds the power button. 

&#x200B;

User: ""oh i know it won't turn on because it fell in the toilet as i was standing up""

&#x200B;

(*phone clatters to desk*)

&#x200B;

What followed was a series of forced smiles and assurances that ""it happens all the time"" and polite requests to lead with pertinent information like ""i dropped this in fresh feces"" next time. So, next time a user tries to hand you something, find out a few details first if you are not wearing gloves.",21,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF786940>

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The company I worked for at the time performed house calls.

We sold a refurbished workstation to an individual purchasing it for their housebound sister and agreed to send a tech onsite to perform the setup.

This turned out to be me and if I'd had the SLIGHTEST inkling of what would be in store I would have stuck my tongue in a light socket and flipped the switch.

Don't get me wrong, I like snakes. And I've always been a cat person. I've only had a few brief periods of my adult life where I didn't have at least one cat. The only reason I've never owned a snake is because cats generally view snakes somewhere between mortal enemies and toys doubling as tasty treats.

In my early bachelor years I didn't necessarily have the cleanest or most kempt house, apartment, or fridge. But this......this was...something else.

At 1000 I head to the customer site, about 40-45 minutes into rural America. Farms, back roads, etc. Beautiful sunny day, nothing foreboding.

So my destination comes into view, a nice triple-wide manufactured home (circa late '70s) with a couple addons sited on about 5 acres. Yard is typical rural, needs mowed, nothing unusual.

>**Me:** \*knock\* \*knock\*  
>  
>*Voice:* ""Come in but don't leave the door open.""

I'm immediately confronted with a hallway lined with terrariums and cages down the right side.

>*Voice:* ""Down the hall and to your left.""

Enroute I realize the cages contain snakes. Lots of snakes. A few have only one or two but most have five or more, apparently grouped by species. As I turn left I see more cages in another room. Distressingly a couple larger ones have no lid.

*Umm....Okay.....*

I'm greeted by a lady in a wheel chair, petting a cat....and more cages. The smell hits me -- stale cat pee. It had been mostly covered by a dry musty snake smell, but in this room it was overwhelming. It literally burned my eyes and nose.

She introduced herself, showing me the desk she'd cleaned off where the PC was going to live. Due to the cages there was no way  I could move the desk (an old military surplus metal desk) so I'd have to get down on the floor to run cords and power.

By this point I'm taking short tiny breaths trying trying to minimize the smell without passing out, but now I can taste it. I'm rapidly developing a headache too. Sweet! This morning keeps getting better by the minute!

I unbox things, set the PC and monitor on the desk, printer on nearby table, and start dropping cables behind the desk.

While I was getting things from the car, she traded the cat for a beautiful corn snake she's petting while sitting there watching me. I'm a little creeped out now, plus four or five cats are trying to climb into the boxes.

*sigh*

I have stuff hooked up,  but I need to run the modem line, printer cord, and power cords. So I get down on the floor, scoot my way across the carpet, and .... why am I sticking to the carpet?

*Oy vey* ... It's cat pee. Not just one time pee, but many, many times.

""Uhh...maam, this carpet is sticky with 'something'.""

""Oh, yes, <cat> has had a couple of accidents down there. But I cleaned it so don't worry.""

*(Internal) <WHAT? You CLEANED IT? I'M STICKING TO THE BLOODY CARPET!!!?*

""Umm...okay.""

I'm committed at this point so I pull the cables along the wall and roll over to reach around the desk leg.

**\*Squish\***

***WTH?***

My arm and shoulder are wet. Why am I wet? Oh for the love of .... OH NO..NO NO NO NO...I did NOT just roll onto carpet SOAKED with cat pee?!??

Yes.

Yes, I did.

I plugged the power cords in and phone line to the jack, scooted out and told her I was done.

""Turn it on and you're good to go. I have to get back to the office.""

She thanked me and I left.

Once outside I scrounged through the back of my car looking for something to put behind my back and rear to sit on.

Nothing. Of course not. I always have crap in my car. But noooo....not this time!

Trunk?

Nope. Nothing there either. Son-of-a-goat....

I finally gave up and sat on my jacket.

Call my boss.

>*""Hey boss, I'm not coming back right away. I need to go home first.""*  
>  
>**""Okay, what's up?""**  
>  
>*""I need a shower.""*  
>  
>**""Why do you need a shower?""**

I'm wiggling around during the call trying to get situated on my jacket so that no part of me is actually touching the fabric of my car when I notice something.

>*""I'm covered in cat pee and what the .... what the hell is...AGGH!!! SNAKE SNAKE!!! SNAKE ON MY LEG!!!!  SNAKE ON MY LEG!!!!! AGGH!!! AGGH!!!""*

*<scramble (fall) out of the car>*

>*""Oh crap oh crap.....wait wait....oh man....""*  
>  
>*<heavy breathing>*  
>  
>""N*o it's okay, it's just a molted skin...I thought it was a live snake for a minute....""*

\*trying to catch my breath\*

My boss, laughing so hard I can hear him crying, can barely speak.

>**""Okay we'll see you after you clean up...but bring the snake in we're gonna start a trophy wall.""**

Boss hangs up.

It wasn't as funny as he thought it was.",100,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF7869A0>
445,When the CEO Is Too Busy,"Over the last 20 years I've worked for some major organisations from global electronics and telecoms to banking. This is not a brag but highlighting what I am about to share that has occurred to me in every organisation which you would think would be more aware/switched on when it comes to the basics of security and the financial/reputational impacts.

PA: Personal Assistant to CEO

PA: Hello, CEO has a problem with their laptop can you come up immediately!

(although nearly always friendly the above is the norm for info I get, so I trundle up being quite blind to what the actual issue is. Normally ranges from cannot find an email/doc, wants some software installed (forget about process and IT security) to the more serious of the mouse not working, adding a printer or something to stop the whole org from functioning the laptop could be goosed in some way).

ME: Hello PA, what is the problem.

PA: Am not sure I had a look but I cannot figure it out (still not giving me much info) The CEO had to leave but left the laptop behind for you. Can you fix it quick!

ME: OK, But I’ll need to log on to the laptop and would be better to be with the CEO as I need them to be logged on as themself and give me more info to the issue.

PA: Well the CEO had to leave, I’ve their logon details and I can call them for more info if you like. Pulls out a notepad with current and all the previous passwords the CEO has used.

End of Story

What am wanting to share here that I am still quite surprised that the heads of a major org will

A: share their credentials with a PA

B: allow others to logon as them to do/fix stuff in their absence

C: have no real thought to the implications if the PA was to loose/give away the creds

D: someone acted maliciously with them

and all under the guise that the CEO is too busy to deal with these issues. Grinds me more though that this is accepted and ignored plus the rest of the workforce can get hauled over the hot coals for exactly the same.

Not just CEO level but I’ve seen further down the chain. Some people really do live in Ivory towers with unicorns prancing about.

EDIT:  As I've been asked, the above is not a single issue I am recalling but a combo of many over the years but the behaviour of the CEOs etc is the same.",216,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF786A00>

447,"Customer sends in order with another random customer's address and payment information, then can't understand why she never received her order","I do tech support and a little bit of order processing and accounts payable/receivable. I got a support ticket a few days ago from a customer asking why her order was never submitted. The conversation went a bit like this:

Customer: I want to know if the order I put in 2 weeks ago has shipped and what the tracking number is.

Me: Hmm, I don't see an order on your account. Can you resend it and I'll let you know it came through?

C: No, I know I sent it. Its been a hassle and I'm not bothering with it again. Find it.

Me: Did you email or fax it? 

C: I faxed it from xxx-xxx-xxxx

*I look up the order and find it*

Me: Ok, I do see this was processed and sent to Blah Blah Medical Supply.

C: WHAT. I've never even heard of Blah Blah Medical Supply. Why would you send it there!

Me: Um, I'm a little confused. Is this not the form you submitted?

C: It is. So why did you send it to this other random customer!

Me: Because that was the information provided...

C: Not by me! That information was already on there when I was sent the form so this is entirely your fault!!!!

Come to find out, my coworker sent her the form without clearing the previous customer's information. Is this our fault? Yeah. Is it incredibly irresponsible to accidently reveal one customer's address and payment information to another? Absolutely. But this lady saw random information she's never seen before and didn't think twice. She didn't brother to scratch it out or anything, just sent back the same exact thing, causing us to duplicate the order for the other customer. Somehow, this made it past her, the doctor, AND their billing department. How no one thought that maybe, juuuust maybe, what they had wasn't right is beyond my comprehension.

And she got free equipment out of it, too. Complained all the way up the chain until we comped her entire order of almost $500. 

P.S. when I processed the first form she sent, there was absolutely no way for me to catch it, due to it having been faxed. Had it been emailed, the system would have told me the account associated with the email and I'd have noticed the discrepancy.

Edit: they're developing an online ordering system to cut out the obviously outdated paper orders. We know it's terrible.",134,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF786AC0>
448,Who needs password security anyways,"Relatively short story. I was only supposed to help a user to access a network folder, which, because its inside their user accounts, requires them to be logged in to do it.

So I call user and he's like ""Oh, I'm currently having an external thing and my computer is unoccupied. But I've told my colleague my password so he can do it with you."" I wanted to throw up right then and there but I figured its not worth it for something that was only supposed to take 5 minutes. I can bring this up with the company later.

So I call this colleague, and he's like ""Oh, I need to turn it on at first. So uh, it takes really long for the computer to boot so can I just tell you his passwords so I don't have to sit here?""

I think you can all relate that all I had to say to that was an exasperated sigh followed by a no. 2 minutes later I was done, and colleague was happy he could return to whatever it is what he was doing. I've learned that this customer apparently had employees tell support agents their passwords during calls unprompted before.

449,"""Come fix it at lunch time""","This may be just a general thing I've found throughout my 10 year life as a Field Tech but does anyone else find that users seem to completely look past the fact that IT people get a lunch break too? 

Prompted from an ongoing call today with a user:

User: ""Hi, when can you sort my phone out. It's urgent!!!"" 

*After diagnosing the issue decide to replace the handset*

Me: ""Okay when are you available for me to do this swap?""

Ohh.. and to add to this when you eventually get your lunch and you're clearly eating, users will walk in completely disregarding the fact you're on lunch and demand help immediately.

450,"This isn't working, fix it! Why is this working?!","The last couple of days have been something else. To truly understand my pain I have to take you back in time to earlier this year when I inherited a project. 

The cast of characters:

**Me**: yours truly, not exactly sure what I do but people keep asking me to do it. 

**B**: Seems to come up with more problems than solutions. Doesn't actually understand her job or anyone else's

**K**: She came up with the project and is supposed to know how it works.

**NB:** New B. This B replaced the other B because the other B got managed out of everyone's way. NB is great but the poor bastard inherited the aftermath of this project. 

It started by B telling me that the project has been going on for a year and nobody on the team has been able to figure out ""*this one part""*  and they figured some fresh eyes would be good. 

I thought it was weird that a project like this was dragging out over a year but whatever. I look at *the one part* and rewrite the code and K says it tested well. Sweet. 

Then a few days later B is pinging me going ""can you look at this other part? That's all that isn't working"". So I looked at the requirements, rewrote the code and K says it works. Awesome.

Then a few days later Be is back again with ""*Did you look at these other things?""* No why would I?  You told me these 3 things were all that I needed to look at.

Whatever. I start going down the list of tasks. I start banging out code according to the functional requirements and I start testing the code to make sure I'm getting results inline with the criteria. To my surprise everything looks good on my end I'm wondering why folks have been having such a hard time. B is telling me each thing is great, K is telling me each thing testing well. 

The for some reason all of a sudden I start hearing things that previously worked were now wrong. Here's where I made mistakes. First I assumed the functional requirements were accurate (they weren't), and second I didn't ask K how her project should function I was dealing with B because that's how the process was supposed to go. 

After talking to K, I came to find out the requirements that B gathered were almost ALL wrong. K gave me new and accurate requirements which I compared to what's in our project software and showed K why everything I did wasn't working...the silence was deafening. What confused me is K had access to the system and was even shown the requirements as written in meetings. 

Whatever. New, good requirements in hand and another few months of beating my keyboard got the project finished. End to end testing happens, the project is finalized, signed off on, and approved for deployment and I release it to the world. I'm the hero, peasants rejoice and all that jazz.

Immediately following the release I'm besieged  with messages from K and her team (lovely people by the way) who are asking me why X is happening or why N is N. Literally everything that is supposed to happen as a result of the project. NB jumps in to help me out. We spend hours walking through every step of this project, putting together documentation that should have already existed and verifying that the ""problems"" people are having are actually what was in the requirements and signed off as part of the test scripts. You know, business as usual. 

Fast forward a few months and I think that brings us up to yesterday.

NB: Hey K is saying X date shouldn't be allowed to be on Xmas Eve. It's a company holiday. Can you tell why the code to stop this isn't working? They should have gotten {message}

Me: Ok so it looks like this code only runs when the status is {scenario 1} or {scenario 2} lets see what's going on.  

After looking at the code and the application itself I've found out that everything behaves as expected when we encounter {scenario 2}. Why isn't {scenario 1} working? 

Apparently at some point {scenario 1} stopped being ""Scenario 1"". Visually {scenario 1} == ""Scenario 1"".  But now, unbeknownst to us {scenario 1} is now an empty string. Fan-Fucking-Tastic.

NB: Quick fix right? 

Me: Sure. Gimme 15. 

NB: Great I'll tell K it's fixed. 

And here we are today...

NB: Hey K wants to know why people are getting {message} in application.

Me: You mean the {message} that they get when they enter an invalid date like Xmas Eve? You mean the message they were complaining about not getting yesterday? You mean THE message?

NB: Yeah it looks like there's a bunch of situations where people entered a holiday and now it's getting caught by design. I guess I'll let K know.

451,"merging companies and tech support, training NOT included","Way back in the olden days I worked Field Service for a computer company.  At one point our corporate guys went on a buying spree and found several computer/automation businesses that were in trouble and started buying them up, mostly to purchase the customer base.  The products were put in an end-of-life status while the sales guys tried to get customers to upgrade to one of our new products.   Some of these outfits had their own field techs so we were dumped into a situation where we were all supposed to be cross training and helping each other.  Of course in some areas we suddenly had two or three techs where there had been one, and some guys started trying to trip each other up so they would ""look better"" when the layoffs started. 

I was the only guy in my territory so I got a few new customers dumped on me, mostly stuff that generated a tiny amount of billing so I figured my days were numbered and started planning my exit strategy.  

In the mean time we had a lot of turmoil in the workforce, a bunch of techs saw the writing on the wall and quit, leaving some areas and customers completely  uncovered.  As an old timer I found myself getting called upon to fly to various cities and fix various problems, sometimes on equipment I had never seen before.  

One of these jobs really sticks in my mind.   We had a customer in the Pacific Northwest that had to move into a new building.   They were planning to upgrade the computer system but in the mean time they had to relocate the old one.  I had never even seen this type of system, let alone worked on one.  I protested to my boss that they should try and find someone else but apparently there was no one except me.   I called a guy I knew who actually was familiar with the system, he was a pretty cool guy and walked me through how to power it up, make sure things were working, so I could ""certify"" it.  

The customer, as it turned out, had already moved the system, they just needed someone from my company to sign off on it.  So, taking my notes and tool bag, I flew into city, got a car, and drove over.

The new building wasn't finished yet, construction was still going on for the interior, and the computer system was just sitting in the middle of floor.  Plugged in but not powered up.   This was a really old system, the console on it was the old teletype variety, not a monitor at all.  So it had a roll of paper, the black enamel keyboard set up, like something out of an old movie.  

The power on/booting sequence was some complicated deal, turn switch A on, then toggle switch B, select position Q on switch C, when LED X  come on, change switch B to the original position, all the stuff from 70s and early 80s vintage minicomputers.    At various points the teletype printer would print out stuff which would tell me if the system was actually up and running.

I met with the customer, a very nice lady, and explained that hopefully the relocation had gone ok and they had connected thing back up correctly.   And I started powering up the system.   I got through the beginning steps but when I got to the part where the printer was supposed to output the ""up and running"" message, nothing happened.

Double checking my notes I put the switches back to the beginning and started over.   Same thing.  After the third attempt I really sweating.  I have no idea how to troubleshoot this system, I have no spare parts for it, no documentation (except the ""how to boot"" notes), and I figuring I'm just going  to have to get the phone with someone, and look like an idiot to this nice customer lady.   I figure I'll give it one more try.

I go through the steps and get to where the printer is supposed to print the ""OK"" message.  I know the printer works since it prints some other messages earlier in the boot process, and that is working normally.   While I'm getting to the final boot step, the nice lady comes up and starts talking to me.   I tell her I'm not sure if things are OK or not, its ""been a while"" since I worked on this type of system, I may have to call someone to double check things.  She's really nice, explains she didn't want to move the system on their own but they were given a deadline to clear the original building, she totally understands if something got broken.  Again she's totally cool to deal with.  We keep discussing what the next steps might be, when the upgrade system is supposed to be installed, stuff like that.

Suddenly I hear the printer start up behind me.   I turn around and there's the ""I'm booted up"" message on the paper.   Sighing with relief I turn back to the nice lady and explain that it looks like thing are OK, the system is up!   I write up my report and now this old system is ""certified"".   Nice lady signs my service report, we'll bill them for this trip, all is well.

Later on I checked back with the guy who gave me the booting instructions I used.   Does it really take over a minute from the last switch to system printing its message?   Yeah, sure it does.   That's just the way it is.  Why do I ask.   I explain that I kept restarting the boot sequence when nothing happened, we have a laugh over that, he didn't think to mention the long wait when he was giving me the run down.   I never had to work on one of those old systems again, I transferred to another department that was installing new Unix systems all over the place as part of a Y2K project.",32,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF786C40>
452,"You can close the ticket, I only needed to open it for my metrics.","A few years ago I was working at a company that was trying to adopt the lean methodology of working. Unfortunately due to company culture it led to a lot of finger pointing and teams trying to justify inefficiency by blaming others.

We had been wondering for a while why a particular team tended to have a lot more calls and tickets to the IT service desk.  The calls were often for issues that would fix themselves. For example we got a ticket that said the printer was performing a cleaning cycle.  Another ticket said Windows Updates performed at inappropriate time.  The list went on of many many, trivial, unspecific requests of IT from this department.

Within the IT team it was somebody's job to spot trends and then a follow-up ticket would be opened up to help determine root cause of issues and improve efficiency.  In this case we could clearly see a trend that there were a lot of tickets but there was no discernible pattern.  On an off chance that maybe a wireless access point was failing in that area, our team followed up with some of the tickets that complained of general slowness, The network being down, or the page won't load.  The usual answer was that it just works now and thank you for your time but you can close the ticket.  One person however was very honest and said ""You can close the ticket, I only needed to open it for my metrics."".  I replied wouldn't it be better to fix the problem so you wouldn't have lost a productivity? The person replied, The computer really wasn't that slow, that you need to do anything. So I ended the call and the next day had lunch with some of my friends in that department to get the real scoop.  Apparently since the push towards lean methodology and efficient had come into being, there was a bonus being offered if you could meet certain unrealistic productivity goals, if you had greater than two IT service tickets in a month your productivity expectation was lowered by a percentage for that month.  Apparently this bonus, although based on productivity provided loopholes to blame others within the company on a team's lack of productivity, a lot of people figure it out that it was very easy to create and then close IT tickets.  I left the company years ago but I am curious if this practice still continues.",65,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF786CA0>

454,"""You don't have to report this""","Hello again all,

Today I have returned with another story, this one is on the shorter side though. The cast for this one is;

* Me: your humble narrator and the hero of this anime.
* User: the ""brilliant"" mind who tried to beat the system

Our story begins on a Thursday morning, and I happen to get a fairly routine call that should've been an easy fix.

Keyword: should've

The call goes as follows;

>Me: Service desk, my name is EonThief, can I have your employee ID number?  
>  
>User: \**provides ID*\*  
>  
>Me: Alright sir how can I help you today?  
>  
>User: My teams isn't working, I'm getting an error message.  
>  
>Me: Alright that's definitely something I can get fixed for you, can I have your 10.98 number?

What we call the assigned local IP of their computers the ""10.98 number"" to simplify what we're asking for.

>Me: Okay sir, can you show me the issue just so I can see if and make sure we're on the same page?  
>  
>User: Of course

He proceeds to pull up teams and sure enough he had the error I was expecting. This error is very common and insanely easy to fix on top of it. The fix involves going into Windows settings and removing and re-adding the work/school account.

As I do this I notice a personal account on the machine, this of course is a big no-no so I go ahead and remove it. Not but a few seconds after removing it the user begins to scold me.

>User: Why did you not ask before removing that account?  
>  
>Me: Because it's a personal account and doesn't need to be on this computer sir per our security policy.  
>  
>User: But you didn't ask me why it was there in the first place.  
>  
>Me: As I mentioned sir, it's against our security policy regardless of your reason. But I do have to ask why?  
>  
>User: I use it for work purposes if the system goes down.  
>  
>Me: \**kinda shocked*\* Can you repeat that?  
>  
>User: I use the personal account, that you deleted so rudely, for work if the system goes down so I can keep working.

Now I was shocked by how confident this person was that he was, like he thought he was playing 5D chess in the year 3021 or something. Unfortunately for him, I really enjoy when users are overconfident about fixes they try. Because I really love destroying that confidence.

>Me: As I said sir you can't have that personal account on your device for security reasons, now that I know that you've been using said personal account for work purposes I will have to inform your supervisor.  
>  
>User: \**playing it cool*\* Nah you don't have to tell my manager.  
>  
>Me: Unfortunately sir I do, you've been breaking security protocol by using that personal account for work purposes. Regardless of any data sent using that email, it still flies in the face of the security policies set by \[*insert company name here*\].  
>  
>User: \**still trying to play it cool*\* Well if you have to tell them then do it, I know I'm in the right here.

The call ends after I get the users issue resolved, I then got all the necessary information and forwarded it all through the proper channels.

Unfortunately, I don't know what happened to the user. If I had to guess, I'd say a very light slap on the wrist and a ""don't do it again"". 

I hope you all enjoyed the story.",123,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF786D60>

It was a dark and stormy night. A shot rang out. A pirate ship....no wait, sorry, that's Snoopy's story.

Mine is a little more prosaic. It was a damp and dreary day.

This was back when Connor hard drives were still good drives before the entire production line went to crap and we had to RMA every 3 out of 5. It got so bad we would save an image of the customer's drive before they picked it up so we could restore to a new drive when it failed.

Customer (nice lady) brings in a beige box PC and wants us to install a second hard drive and also upgrade the modem to a 28.8k generic internal winmodem.

Great. No big deal. Into the queue it goes.

It's been a quiet week, only 6 or so on the bench and another half-dozen pending.

Sometimes when slow we might juggle the queue based on EJL (Estimated Job Length) instead of TOA (Time of Arrival). This job is about as quick as you could get. Install the modem, drivers, and hard drive then test it.

I tell Tech 1, a newer kid just out of high-school, to slot it into the #2 spot in the queue.

Mid-morning the following day we have about 9 machines in the queue, but the bench is full with machines doing stuff (diagnostics, OS install, etc.) so Tech 2, me, and our cashier are up front talking while a couple customers browse.

From the back of the store:

>Tech 1: ""Hey <samplesize> what do we do with mice?""  
>  
>Me: ""....""  
>  
>Tech 2: ""What?""  
>  
>Tech 1: ""I've got a mouse here and I don't know what to do with it.""

Tech 2 and I look at each other.  Quick game of psychic 'Rock-Paper-Scissors' and I win but then he throws the ""I've got seniority"" head nod so I lose.

I can't respond to Tech 1 the way I want because of customers, so I'm walking towards the back....

>Me: ""Well is it working?""  
>  
>Tech 1: ""No, I don't think it's moving anymore.""  
>  
>Me: ""....""

Tech 1 has a flashlight and is peering into an open vertical mini-ATX form-factor case.

>Me: ""What are you doing?""  
>  
>Tech 1: ""Well I have a mouse here and I don't know what to do with it.""  
>  
>I channel Nick Burns: ""MOOOVE!""

*<grab flashlight>*

Tech 1 points into the back corner under the sound card in the bottom ISA slot.

>Me: ""👀""

A mouse.

A big one.

I grab a slot cover and poke it. Nope. Not moving. I scooch it out of there and flip it on a piece of paper.

We all stand there (including the customers) looking at about four to five inches of mummified mouse.

Huh.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

We never could figure out *how* the ADULT mouse got in the case. Nothing chewed, no nesting materials found, only a couple droppings, no slot covers or drive bay covers missing....nothing. We couldn't find any way the mouse could access the case.

The only thing we could come up with was perhaps it crawled in there to die while the cover was removed at the customer's home at some point. Maybe from hantavirus.",43,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF786DC0>
456,"""I'm not a computer person!!!""","Been in support and a sysadmin for over 20 years now and I have seen a TON. Here is one of my favorites:

I was giving a Phishing presentation for about 100 of our sales reps at their national sales meeting about 15 years ago, when Phishing was new.  I had a short slideshow with phishing email examples and what to look for highlighted and things of that nature.

At one point I displayed a fake email that looked to be from Washington Mutual, asking the recipient to click this link to fix their account becasue there was a problem.  I talked about this email, why it was fake, how a financial institution will never send you a link to click, etc.. when a lone sales rep pipes up:

rep: ""I got that exact email""

me: ""Oh what did you do, did you click the link?""

rep: ""yeah""

me: ""oh no, what information did you enter? If you entered your back login then you'll need to change your password right away!""

rep: ""oh, I just entered our <proprietary sales rep portal that links to nothing else in the world> credentials and clicked login, but I got an error.""

me: ""Whew, well, luckily, that info is not used anywhere else except our internal system. Tell me, why did you enter that info?""

rep: ""I didn't know what else to enter, I don't have a Washington Mutual account""

me: ""Wait, you don't have a WaMu account? Then why did you even click the link, let alone enter some random info that doens't mean anything anywhere else except to our internal systems?""

At this point, you can hear the rest of the room murmuring

rep: ""I thought it had something to do with our <Company> Bank Of America Credit Card.""

me: ""You thought an email from WaMu had to do with a Bank Of America account?""

Now the murmuring got louder and you can hear snickering

rep: ""I am not a computer person""

me: ""that's not a computer thing!""

Rest of the room starts laughing. I thought I was going to get fired or at least reprimanded for making a user feel stupid but apparently even his manager was laughing. He didn't last 2 months after that, he was let go for poor sales performance.",145,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF786E20>

User: Hello. The charge on my laptop battery is low and I don’t have a spare one. Can you send me another battery please. 

Me:  *thinking about my career choice for a second*  You should have received a charging cable when you were given the laptop. Do you have that?

User: Well I have this blue cable with plastic clips on both ends. 

Me: That is a network cable. The one you are needing is black and has a power brick in the middle of it. It will be quite large.

My groups mates for a class were complaining that their computers were over heating, and so I asked them if they had tried spraying air into the fans. They looked at me as if I was speaking an alien language, and responded with “that’s too High tech for me”.

Turns out that said beige box was running on MS-DOS and his blinking cursor problem was DOS finishing the boot process and idling at C:\\> This fellow had apparently bought over an SME and was going through their assets to see which could be reused or liquidated.

Sent him back without any charges since there was nothing to fix. Though we wondered what kind of business would still have a working DOS box lying around in 2021.

460,I don't know how to get google .. troubleshooting a bad credit union site cert over the phone with a bit of a surprise,"so this older lady OL that is lady I helped who had a bad monitor a while back (something clearly smacked into it and yeah.. it was no good.. i told her how to get a new one and such but she has my number now) .. she calls me about an hour ago all freaked out.  Like in a panic

Her credit union site is showing a bad cert warning but she's convinced she's been hacked 'I use a mac.. i thought those were safe!' .. she had called the credit union and they were no help.

Me: Can you tell me the address in the address bar? 

OL: I don't know what that is .. it says NAME OF CREDIT UNION

Me: (i use the same CU) and I fire it it up and it's fine.  I read out the url to her and ask her if she sees that

her: she says yes but reads her's back wrong (she's like 80+) she's like I""m kind of freaking out I wish I had smoked some weed to calm down (for real;)

Me: (thinking maybe she's got a bad cache on safari or the wrong address without https .. and explaining that over the phone isn't going to work) So can go you to google?

OL: I don't know how to get to get to google.

Me: how do you get to your bank?

OL: I'm not sure.  I click the button

Me: Ok if you were going to search for something what would you do?

OL: I type in what I want into this thing

ME: OK type [the name of the credit union] in there

OL: Oh you mean Duck Duck Go?

ME: YES!  Duck Duck Go .. (amazing)

OL: oh I see links to credit union

ME: click on any of those links

OL: oh No more warning and i'm logged into

ME: that's great .. so you probably just had something wrong but you are not hacked.  Please just do this if you need to get to your credit union from now on (now way am i trying to figure out what button she pushes or how to fix whatever link it is over the phone)

she was so happy .. i'm like man .. if I would have said can you 'Duck Duck it' that would have been a lot easier

cracked me up.  

She's making me a pie

edit: just as an addon she totally called the credit union about this and they were zero help at all .. which I told her was pretty bogus.  Then I was like well I use that credit union and they have a pretty good android/iphone app that I use a lot .. and she was like 'oh I don't have one of those phones.. mine flips'  I was like ok .. don't worry about it :)  Bless her",40,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF786FA0>
461,Just Wipe The PC's,"This is going to be a long one. This story was back around 2005/6. I had been at my job for a few years, and  was still new to things in general. Because I worked at a mom and pop shop, budgets were next to nothing and often corners were cut. But I digress.

We sold a large number of machines with Asus M2N based boards, these had I think the 6000 based MCP or whatever Nvidia called it, they were cheap and yes, they all eventually failed. XP was still ruling supreme, and most builds had XP Professional.

We had a VAR that bought machines from us. (VAR = Value Added Reseller) He was easy to get along with and didn't mind sharing tips and tricks and info on things we needed. Our VAR had configured an office setup for a mining company. (Maybe they didn't do the actual mining but they managed the resources because they oversaw various sites and locations.)

I remember the day clearly. It was snowing and a young lady brought in with her boyfriend, about 6 or so desktop machines. They had made arrangements for us to rush reload these over the weekend with the owner of our shop. I believe it was a Friday, because it would have been around 3PM, when the mining office closed. So we had till Monday morning to get them reloaded. We had received an email about them, our service lead had it, and it was an excerpt quote from a chain of emails that were sent back and forth.

We were told that data was NOT an issue as the office had a server.

I usually inspected machines before reloading them. Most of the machines were empty, nothing on them to speak of. However, one machine was chock full of files. I hesitated because if they had a server, why were these files here? We tried to get more info, but because the boss wasn't there on weekends and we had our instructions, you guessed it, we wiped every machine and reloaded fresh Windows. Oh, and there was a spare HDD in the PC that had the files but it was empty. I know, I should have installed Windows on that, but it could have caused complications of its own if I did that.

So Monday rolls around they pick up the machines and I figure OK, everything is ok.

A few hours later though, the boss gets a call about missing files, and because he never handles Tech issues, he passed it off to us. So, we quickly realized that there wasn't a server, at least not the kind you would expect. 

I'll save you the torment. The PC that was full of files was a peer based fileshare that held ALL the files. And we erased it AND reinstalled Windows over top. I was livid. Somewhere, something was badly overlooked. Being the nice guy I was, and because I genuinely felt bad, I did almost 16 hours of both in shop and onsite recovery for that company. I didn't bill anyone, I did it out of respect as I recall that my boss wasn't going to do anything and essentially hand them to dry.

So I'm onsite recovering files, and of course, because this office doesn't spend big bucks, they don't use Outlook they use Outlook Express. So the recovery app is recovering email files. Want to know the kicker? 

In the email string, our VAR clearly mentioned to our boss that the one machine hosted all those files as peer file server and should not be wiped. Our boss decided not to forward the entire string of emails otherwise we would have been able to read through and realize that drive should have been left.

I talked with the VAR sometime after that  incident and he appreciated what I did, he understood why I did it, and he didn't have healthy words for what went down. He still did business with us, as he was able to get decent prices through us, but we essentially never services his clients after that. He basically treated the boss as stupid because he clearly outlined details...and the info was not forwarded.

Now, I don't have any info as to what the VAR setup in terms of backup, it could be the company declined. After the incident, I gave them a cheap RAID card, hooked up the extra spare HDD as a sort of extra layer of protection,  and tried my best to get the files. I think I got maybe 20-30% of the files.

I left that company in 2010/11 because they had been bought out by some guy that was looking to create a local rival to Best Buy by buying out local companies and making a conglomerate of some sort, but the company was epically stupid when it came to management. The owner constantly was going from one ""idealism"" or concept to another as if he was chasing the ultimate ethos that would work magic in his stores. We would get emails telling us to watch some video and adopt the philosophy in our work.

One example of stupidity, that yes in hindsight I could have taken action on, but oh well...... certain full time staff like Tech #1 from my last post, were ""upgraded"" to salary. With salary, they got to choose what time they started and left to a degree. Because the store was open 8:30 - 5:30, they had to be there for 8 hours minimum, and they got a one hour lunch. But if the forgo the full hour lunch, they could instead choose to do 9-5. Well, that means there was a half hour gap opening and closing, so it was my schedule to be there the full 8:30 till 5:30. I figured all was good, I put my timesheets in, I got my paycheck. But one day the HR Manager calls me and asks why I keep adding extra time to my days. I explain to him that I've been told to be there from opening to close because there is an hour gap with no staff. He tells me he's been removing the extra time. Yeah, I was just done with the company. Anyways, you got my first data recovery nightmare and a bonus story about a stupid company.

I have stories about when I worked at Staples (Canada) and Future Shop, so sometime I'll write those up. It's amazing how many people are in this industry that shouldn't be!",13,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF787040>
462,Teacher doesn't know what a mouse looks like. Blames IT,"So this happened about fifteen years ago when I worked at a Primary and Secondary School. I was happily typing away at my computer when a student knocks on our basement office door.

Student: IT, Mrs X can't get her mouse working.

Me: Let's go check it out.

I quickly go with the student to Mrs X's classroom 

Mrs X: About time

I internally what to swear, I came the moment the student came and got me. I try to just get to her desk to look at the issue, she has an Acer computer on her desk that is connected to a screen and projector. The mouse were wireless so most likely it could just be the battery. 

Mrs X: The mouse on this student computer isn't working, so my SmartBoard isn't working and it is costing me valuable Teaching Time. Your systems are terrible.

Me: I'm sorry.

I want to tell her to shut up, this always happens. Call me up, complain I'm late and then make me wait while you bitch so I can't fix the problem.

Mrs X: Don't be sorry just fix it. And next time you upgrade systems make sure they work before you leave.

Me: Ok

I had long since given up trying to explain to people when and how we upgrade, her last upgrade had been about six months prior. But if I had told her that she would have either refused to believe it or complained that the issue was she hadn't been upgraded since then.

I take one look at her desk, and instantly see the issue. The mouses we use were dark blue and wireless, and annoyingly the whiteboard erasers were also dark blue.

I quickly and hiding my action from the students switch the two so that she doesn't look bad. I then flip the mouse over and check its buttons on the bottom, then put it back and show it is working.

Me: All fixed. Just needed to be turned off and on.

Mrs X: Why?

Before I can come up with an answer.

Student: You were using the eraser! 

And queue all the kids laughing.

Me: I'm sorry I tried my best to hide it.

Mrs X: Students, quiet.

I tell her it is all fixed and feel free to let me know if I can help any further, she simply nods and lets me go.

I get back to my office and tell My Manager what happened. I also write her an email apologising for not being able to hide the swap of Eraser and Mouse better, it may have been funny but I tried my best to protect staff from being laughed at by students.

Later that day I head off and sleep, returning the next day to a meeting request from her, Head of Junior and My Manager. Turns out that she made a formal complaint that I made her look bad. My Manager tells me to refuse the meeting and he will go in my place.

I don't know what was said there, but My Manager basically told me that she was complaining that I didn't just go and get a spare mouse to save her from looking bad. And that by doing what I did I undermined her ability in the classroom and had ruined her credibility with the students and parents. She was furious that My Manager had stopped me coming, though he counted it all. Stating to her and the Head of Junior that blaming IT for stupid mistakes won't be tolerated. And that if she wants he will happily take her complaint to the Principal, though will make it clear that I had done my best to hide her stupidity.

She dropped the complaint, and was friendly to me from then on. Though I could tell she didn't like me.",303,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF7870A0>
463,Word processors do to words what food processors do to food,"More of a salutary lesson than a funny story...

I support a suite of products that produce a large volume of data which can be stored and/or exported to Kafka.

The Kafka exports have json based filter rules allowing you to set up streams of interest.

Following a difficult install at $CUSTOMER we set about applying their customisations as handed down from the sales team.

All went well until we hit the addition of one of the above Kafka filter rules, parser says it's not valid json...

Read it through carefully (couple of hundred lines in the filter), looks good

Run ""python -m json.tool filter.json"" gives ""Error on line 146, expected property name"", look at 146, it's perfectly valid json, it's the start of the 1st filter that sales added to the default set and the line is just

  
   ""propertyname"": ""value"",

In vim ""unindent""  the file and realise the above filter remains pretty printed,

Next we realise that the new filter had been sent in the body of a mail and so was formatted by Outlook and space became non-breaking space in the body of the filter someone had pasted into the file from Outlook.

Deleted all nbsp and filter was read fine.

464,"""It's in above average condition""","In the typewriter service industry, it's a rare treat to chance on a truly new machine.  I guess I should use the word ""new"" carefully here since new machines suck bad.  With the majority of the machines I see being vintage (post war-80s) or antique (1800s-wwii), condition varies heavily.  Generally work is quoted on condition, like, how much effort is it going to take to get this machine typing again.  

Once in a while a machine will come in that needs a tune up and a wipe down, and looks gorgeous.  Usually I get a rust bucket with dents, paint chips, missing parts, and a baggie with parts from some VCR or something.  Despite the wide range of machine conditions, I've never had someone say ""my machine is in really bad shape.""  They all just try to put it lightly, I get it, be polite.  

So today I'm going to select one such story, and share it with the internet:

I was contacted a bit ago to overhaul a Woodstock typewriter.  A lovely standard manufactured in the Chicago area, well... in Woodstock.  The client made sure to note that it was in ""above average"" condition.  

When I got it, I was surprised to find that not only was it caked in rust, cobwebs, hair, and dirt, but that it also wouldn't shift, type, advance, or feed paper.  Basically it was a frozen and entirely useless block of metal.  I wouldn't say it was above average.  It was probably average. 

The machine needed a ton of work, involving having the carriage removed from the machine, stripped and rebuilt, the escapement rebuilt and re-calibrated, the bearing rails realigned, things cleaned, parts for the shifter... and a crapload of polish.  All in all it typed fantastic after, and looked like it had only sustained MINOR saltwater submersion. 

Moral of the story, take care of your typewriters, but don't be afraid to make an honest statement about how truly decrepit it is. 

Side note, it isn't uncommon for people to find parts machines in antique stores.  Those few machines that others in the industry have decided to salvage to fix others.  It was common practice, even back in the day.  I had one such machine come in, a post 1930 Royal Portable (the entire serial number categorization system is a bit of a pet peeve of mine, story for another time), which didn't type or shift.  Not only were the rails bent, but it was also missing the rod retainer for the main shifter (for capitals) and the entire escapement.  I had to swap parts from another ""parts"" machine that was worse off to get this one typing.  I was told it worked!!  It's shocking how many machines come through that are missing parts, not counting folks who try their hand at repair first, and then ask me to carry it to the finish line.  Those are always missing parts with the exception of one client who managed to keep track of every screw he took out and delivered them in organized baggies.  Generally I don't approve of people diving into a project like this with uncertainty, but that's how you learn.  It does make my job super hard to reverse engineer the machine and figure out where every one of the dozens of levers and screws belong.  

So that's all for now, have a wonderful day, etc etc.",61,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF787160>

466,"""It's not my internet""","First post here! Not very crazy, but it's my first real issue so here goes!

Context: While I'm in college, I work as a customer service slash software troubleshooter for a fitness company. Basically, my job is to either answer questions about the membership plans, process refunds, and help people factory reset their fancy treadmills when they update incorrectly, which loses no settings or anything because everything is stored on our servers.

Sometimes we get customers whose internet does not quite work with the machines -- the most common issue is that the customer is using 5.8Ghz networks but the machines only work on 2.4Ghz. Most of the time we can run a third-party network scanning test, email them the pdf with the list of things they need to fix(split the merged 5.8+2.4Ghz network into two separate ones, unblock certain IPs, etc) so they can call their ISP. And that often works, at least temporarily . . .

Until this guy. He's complaining about the fancy workouts stopping mid-process and having to take time to reconnect. He's been at this for months, and I'm looking through the documentation and a previous network test . . . Not only are there several different issues that could be problematic, he's also getting 6Mbps Down and less than 1Mbps Up. That, and we've already done a factory reset several times for him, which(outside of sending a new $400 console under warranty, which we can only do if it's actually the console that's damaged) is the biggest thing we can do.

So the guy's on the phone(while in the car, mind you, so I can't even try troubleshooting anything if I wanted to), and after I start listing some things about his network that need changing for the machine to work correctly, he starts demanding I send a new console or fix it now. Well, he's not at home, so I can't fix it at all, and I know for a fact that I can't send him a new console -- I've had new consoles denied for much more convincing issues -- so I tell him, no, it's your network. Which it is, I'm looking at his very suboptimal speeds, the list of things that have been done to troubleshoot it, and several other issues with his network.

So the guy starts asking ""How do you know? How do you know it's my network? Because this doesn't make sense, it's obviously something with the software, but you're saying it's my network."" The guy goes about that for a good 5 minutes before hanging up and calling it BS cos we can't fix something that's not even our problem.",37,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF787220>

I'd moved on to another job by this point but this company also did house calls. The owners were some of the best employers (if not the best) I've ever had.

A call came in and got routed to the shop looking for someone to make an onsite tech support call for a Windows 98 machine that wouldn't connect to the internet.

According to the front desk the customer was bedridden and this was their primary means of contact with the outside world.

Okay, sounds great. Sounds like something we'd fix a dozen times a day, get to do a good deed and help somebody, feels good man.

Heh.

So I show up at the house, ring the bell, and a woman opens the door with a little excited gasp.

\*blink\*

Okay, this person knows what Usenet is and apparently what it's for. That's unusual.

**Woman:** ""I thought maybe it was his Forte Agent Usenet reader but the PC wasn't getting an IP so I reset Winsock, and the dialup works but the PPP daemon doesn't get an addresses. If I dial up using Hyperterm I get a prompt and if I log in I get the PPP sequence so I don't think it's the ISP or the modem.""

\*Jaw drops/blank stare\*

*Me:* ""Well that's more troubleshooting than most people normally do. So do you work in IT?""

**Woman:** ""No, I'm his home care worker. But he's been my only patient for 4 years, 4 days a week 12 hours a day. All he does is watch news and live on his computer.""

*Me:* ""Wow, so how do you know how to troubleshoot Winsock?""

**Carer (Woman):** ""I've had to learn all of this just to survive. But when he dies I'm going back to college to go into tech. I hate health care now. I used to love it, but not anymore.""

*Me*: ""Wow...well it's a great career but you still have to deal with people.""

An all white room with white curtains containing five pieces of furniture.

1. A 55"" rear-screen projection TV
2. A floor lamp with what must have been a 500 watt full spectrum UV bulb. I swear I needed sunglasses and I think I could feel the heat from 10 feet away.
3. A side table
4. A monitor/keyboard/mouse tray on an articualted arm attached to a rolling stand.
5. An oversized hospital style powered bed.

In the bed was the largest person I've ever seen in person in my life. The gentleman had to have weighed at least 600 lbs (270kg). The bed appeared longer and wider than a normal bed, and he filled it completely.

Best of all....

*(wait for it....)*

>!....he was naked.!<

>!I suppose technically he wasn't 'exposed' as he had a sheet draped over his nether regions, but everything else was soaking up the fake sun coming from that blinding floor lamp. I don't think he was cold because it was probably close to 80 in that room.!<

>!It was a thin sheet.!<

Though somewhat disconcerting, I started troubleshooting (he had a 128k ISDN connection) and as I worked as he explained why he needed the computer working, to which I made appropriate interested noises at various intervals.

Annoyingly I kept having to wipe everything off. The floor, the computer, everything was covered with a whitish chalky dust. Weird.

I reached a point where I had to pull the addon serial card (common with external ISDN modems). The inside of the case was entirely coated with dust. Thick enough that I couldn't read the silkscreen printing on the boards so I took it outside, grabbed a can of air from my rig, and blew it clean.

I used almost an entire can of air and of course the wind shifted several times and blew clouds of dust back on me.

Back in the house I went. Replaced the serial card (I kept lots of spare common components with me), hooked everything up, reset winsock again and the TCP configuration, dialed up, and voila! All good.

Got all my stuff back in my jump bag and tool box, gave him the hand written T&M invoice, told him he'd get the final bill in about 7 days, and headed back.

Enroute I called in because we were short a field tech and there had been discussion about my heading to another (business) customer depending on when I was done. I kept having to cough and clear my throat as I was talking to the front desk.

A bit about the personality of the Front Desk person who answered the phone (one of my favorite co-workers ever).

A hilarously feisty redhead, she had great business acumen and super customer service skills. But along with these, she was also possessed of a sick twisted sense of humour that took great delight in everything from scaring the crap out of any/everyone to trying to gross out everyone in the room. If she could say make someone barf, gag, or scare them into peeing their pants she considered it a good day's work.

**Front Desk:** ""You okay?""

*Me:* ""Yeah, that house was just full of dust. Like powdered chalk or something. I mean I can feel it on my teeth and see it on my skin and clothes it was so thick.""

*<pause>*

*<tappity-tap-tap>*

**Front Desk:** ""Was that <so-and-so's> house?""

*Me (spidey sense warning of impending doom):* ""Yeeess.....why?""

**Front Desk:** ""You know 90% of household dust is dead human skin, right? His house is probably more like 99%.""

*Me:* ""AAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH...YOU'RE SICK!!! Are you SERIOUS???!""

**Front Desk (giggling):** ""Yeah. You just ate a mouthful of Mr. <so-and-so>.""

* I start hyperventaliting at this point while trying to simultaneously: A) not gag and throw up in my car; B) Find a water bottle; C) Find a parking lot to pull into to throw up, rinse my face off, and shake off as much of the DEAD HUMAN SKIN as I possibly can.

*Tech in near background:* ""What the.....Who are you talking to and who did they eat?""

*Front Desk:* ""<samplesize> and he was just at <so-and-so's> house. I told him all that dust was dead skin.""

**Tech in background:** ""BWAAHAHAHAHAHAHA....<samplesize> just ate Mr. <so-and-so>""

Later that evening:\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Wife (works for a surgeon, always has interesting stories):** ""How'd your day go?""

*Me:* ""Kinda meh I guess. Got to eat a guy today tho....""

**Wife:** .....😳

*Me:* ""Well I couldn't say I didn't inhale. How was your day?""

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

*P.S. It was months before I stopped hearing ""Hey, leave a bite for someone else,"" or ""Don't eat to much,"" every time I left the shop on a call....*",52,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF787280>
468,Nine months later and I'm still screaming into the void,"This was from really early in my IT career, right after I'd first started at Big Insurance Co. Some internally developed DB frontend and an Oracle ODBC installer. At some point pretty soon after switching from XP to 7, the package stopped working. Not the install, anyone who had it worked fine, and manually installing our frontend and a fresh copy of the ODBC worked correctly.

One who is not in charge of that package might note fairly quickly that the problem was pretty obviously the ODBC installer and not the frontend. In a staggering leap of logic fueled by the sincere desire for this to be Someone Else's Problem (tm) the folks in charge of packaging the software (SCCM) determined the problem was the frontend, not the ODBC installer.

This gets escalated to the DB admins and an unsuspecting dev team who has no idea what to do because this frontend was developed two contractors ago and no one in the company really owns the code anymore. Meeting... after meeting... after meeting later where I'm constantly calling out that it isn't the frontend and can we please update the ODBC installer to one that we know works, and ultimately it fell on deaf ears every time.

Finally I had enough. I created a copy of the SCCM package, swapped out the installer, and pushed it to my machine. (At one point or another I'd managed to get Domain Admin, Web Admin, Net Admin and many other credentials that were never removed from my account... including full SCCM access.) Lo and behold, installed without a hitch with only a few tweaks to the package.

So I chime in the meeting, ""Uh, hey, I think I fixed it.""

""What?""

""The package. I changed out the Oracle installer and it's working now.""

""You EDITED a PACKAGE?"" As though I'd committed some mortal sin.

""No, I edited a copy of a package and nothing is published yet. But it does work now.""

This bag with which one douches spent the next fifteen minutes trying to get me in trouble rather than looking at the fix. I know better than to expect people to admit mistakes, but yeesh when the fix is literally dropped in your lap at least have the grace to not try to screw over the guy who fixed it.

Nothing came of the attempts to hold me responsible for circumventing the process (said process had been ongoing for 9 months and coincidentally was much like the less pleasant parts of childbirth) and likewise no one held the Director in charge responsible for two thirds of a year worth of cock-ups.

I'm not entirely convinced the Director wasn't trying to justify a project to rewrite the old frontend. He was notorious for hiring contractors to fix problems that wouldn't have been problems except that his whole department was useless.

TL:DR - IT Director spends 9 months ignoring lower level techs telling him how to fix a simple problem.",9,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF7872E0>
469,"""No one told me it needed to be plugged in!""","I do industrial commissioning for equipment, usually low and medium voltage. I have to travel a lot and I do all sort of projects, from port cranes, to mine elevators, steel mills, paper mills, solar sites, etc. 

I was coming back from a job and my connecting flight was through the US. I my plane lands and immediately the airline is paging me. I go to the desk and they tell me that someone is frantically trying to get a hold of me. It is my supervisor. 

He needs me to get on a different plane. A site had been commissioning, the PLC guy has left, only now they are down and its a big fiasco. I remind my boss that I am not really a PLC guy (mostly drives and motors). He needs someone there ASAP. So I go to at least figure out what the problem actually is. 

When I arrive, the facility has a LOT of people in suits and ties because apparently this was to be the initial light off of the production line. So bosses from overseas. I find a manager and ask him the issue. He just points to a room and tells me to fix it. 

So I walk to the room and find the PLC rack. The power supply to it is disconnected. Just laying there on the bottom of the panel. So I find the breaker and turn it off. Then I mount it and turn it on. 

Green lights look good.

Walk out and ask them to try it. System works. People very happy. 

The one manager comes to me and asks me how I fixed it. 

>""I plugged it in""

>""That's it?!? Well I'm not paying you for 5 minutes of work"".

>""Of course not. You owe me travel time as well""

I never got a straight answer as to who disconnected the power supply. I offered and gave some free training to a couple of technicians to try and prevent this from happening again. Turns out they had a computer, but no one knew how to get into it or use the program, so I spent a few hours helping those folks out. How to refer to drawings, the overall protection scheme and whatnot, but it was not prepared and I was figuring out stuff as I went. 

I contacted my boss and explained how little the techs know and they need help, to which he replied the end user refuses to pay for training. So technically I should not have done any sort of training, but at the end of the day, these techs were stuck on an island. Very nice and respectful to me because they were not stupid.  They realized just how clueless they were. 

Their boss though...he made it very clear I was never to be back there again.",131,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF787340>
470,"When ""turning it off and back on"" does not work","At my workplace, there are some industrial control systems, including relatively new ones, where if they are power cycled, they will reset back to factory default settings. I have joked in the past that a ransomware operator could simply threaten to power cycle the entire facility (e.g. have a compromised server broadcast reboot commands), and that would cause quite a bit of chaos if they did that.

I know the backup batteries in those systems are healthy. The issue is that the programmable logic controller programming didn't properly utilize specific memory addresses that are backed by battery power, and instead stored important data in the unprotected memory addresses.

A recently installed system that was under warranty was randomly throwing alarms and halting. The vendor's technician came over to our site and couldn't determine what was causing the alarms to randomly go off.

He suggested power cycling the machine. I told him that every 30 seconds of unscheduled downtime will cost the company several thousand dollars. I offered to help him talk to my management to find an available block of time so that we didn't have to worry about an excessive downtime, but he argued ""it won't take long"".

I told him to talk to my department manager. He convinced him that the machine would be back up and running in just a few minutes after power cycling it and got the go-ahead.

He power cycled it after putting the machine in a safe neutral position.

His machine's configs were wiped clean.

He asked me if we had a backup of the machine's programming, and I told him ""Management doesn't keep backups of machines that are under warranty because they assumed the vendors would have them. Surely your company has a backup of the machine that they are providing warranty support for?""

My supervisor came walking over to ask how long it would take for the machine to be up and running again.

In the aftermath, the vendor was forced to eat the full cost of the lost production time when my company's legal department ended up joining the email conversation to explain to the vendor of their own warranty policy after the vendor tried to skate away from that mess.",85,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF7873A0>
471,"""Sir you have the authority to redirect cargo planes in flight""","So, I've always had this one stowed away for a rainy day as I think it was a pretty cool tale from back in the day (Circa 2015-2016). I started out my career contracting, usually, 3-6 month gigs just scrounging by to get experience, not particularly concerned about what company and the pay packet as I was still living at home at the time.

Contracting allows you to work at some preeetty big companies for short durations of time, looks nice on a resume (I hope), and gives you the experience and feel for what it's like when you see how IT operations are carried out in smaller orgs and bigger orgs and in this case, Fortune 100 Civil Engineering. 

My role at this company initially was very broad, we were consolidating two offices and moving them about 2-3 Kilometers down the street to a different office. On top of that was also a device refresh so we were receiving an office's worth of Dell Latitude laptops, some of their CAD ones with Quadro graphics cards in them, some snazzy 14"" foldable ones for Execs etc. Dell was awarded this contract from us because apparently, HP couldn't play ball and wasn't able to provide the goods within our tight deadlines, suffice to say - this was a fairly large contract given the context of the numbers of devices and the organization they were going to.

Anyway, so we're finished with the rollout (post complimentary upgrade to 64GB ram on our laptops which came out of the factory misconfigured with only 32) and now we're in the meat and potato part of the project - moving all this stuff down the street. At the new location, we'd already purchased a metric crapload of peripherals (with spares) and as with all moves you then have the luxury of going through things and addressing the hiccups and bumps that occurred along the way, ""defects"" if you will with the move.

Well, one fairly large defect that reared its ugly head relatively soon into the office move was the rate at which our keyboards were failing on us, not the mouse - just the keyboards. Certain keys actually and they were failing at a rate of maybe 20-30%. Normally, if you only bought maybe 10-20 or maybe 30 you'd probably be okay with these margins but if you blow these out to 200/300 keyboards (with spares not in the field) you can see how this would become problematic. 

Anyway, fast forward a bit I'm sitting on an email chain about 8-10 emails deep at this point with generic Helpdesk from Dell who of course, needed to run through his checklist for things which went a little something like

>> Could you check the A S D and F keys please?

Sure, why not, Okay - I've already done this at triage but okay I'll do it again just for you :)

>>  Could you then make sure the G H J and K keys work please?

..Sure, even though I told you it's the Q W and E keys that aren't working?

>>  Yes, that is correct, please ensure as per my last email that those keys are working first.

Okay, well they are, but as per my initial email I've got a pile of 20 keyboards and they're rising by the minute that don't have functioning Q W and E keys which as you can understand - are quite problematic for my users.

Anyway, my manager notices the pile increasing day by day in the server room and these emails go in and out of phone calls to more emails as Dell wants to basically run a battery of tests on each and every one of these entry-level keyboards (think maybe entry-mid range) before they accept any of them back (we haven't been provided a shipping label even by this point)

My manager's pissed, not at me but just in general of the process because my hourly rate that I've spent on this issue so far is probably in line with how much these keyboards cost. My manager (the best one that I've ever had in my career so far btw) was generally a pretty volatile person, he could go 0-100 on you with intensity pretty fast, and more often than not it was difficult to know if he was being sarcastic or real with you at any given moment. 

I think there was a bit of a struggle to find who our Dell rep was at first, he's digging through his emails swearing he at some point or another had previously emailed this person but was at a loss in the maze that was his Outlook inbox. But when he does, he just simply forwards the email onto me and delegates the task on, and simply says - reach out to this person, see to it that the issue is rectified sooner after speaking to her (gross summary of events)

I reach out to the Dell rep who quickly surmises the situation from my point of view, I forward on my email chain with the person I'd been speaking to onto her and then **silence**. The next day rolls in my manager on the phone with someone, he's speaking in Cantonese and evidently, our Rep also spoke Cantonese. They have a good healthy (friendly) discussion back and forth over the course of maybe an hour or so. 

Next thing you know Dell's Helpdesk suddenly swings their doors wide open, someone physically comes on-site to a quick inspection of the keyboards that need to be RMA'd with 1:1 replacements and spares. They're profusely sorry, I get forwarded an email somehow (BCC'd in somewhere presumably) and I witness what can only be verbally described as a professional beat down over text, following sincerest apologies and a promise to never let it happen again. Turned out or Dell rep was like the regional customer relations manager (or something to that effect) presumably due to how big we are as a client in the region. 

**Edit** (Missing part goes here due to jebait-y TL;DR)

So, after the beat down occurs internally on their end - of course, the immediate correspondence with their helpdesk is a bit less...structured shall we say, and a bit more free-flowing. As if the restrictions and floodgates are raised and you're now significantly more important than you were yesterday - so much so, they start a new email chain, cleaning the slate. 

I'm still dealing with the same individual (evidently, he doesn't get fired or taken off the case - nor should he) but the follow-up correspondence is roughly how it goes from there. (Obviously, this isn't word for word, none of these correspondence lines is word for word)

>> Dear Mr. Terra, please advise the number of keyboards you require and we will proceed to ensure timely delivery of any replacement units as soon as possible.

(At this point, there's no point rubbing it in) Hi <tech>, as discussed previously, if we could receive the agreed-upon quantity of Keyboards in the previous email that would be great - but understand that we anticipate at this point that over the coming days - weeks - months the failure rate may be more prevalent than at this time. It would be greatly appreciated, given how long this matter has gone on for - that your timely response and actions be sped up if possible as we're beginning to run out of spare units  (we weren't but I was just hoping to get some space back and make the issue go away)

>> Sure Mr Terra, as per your initial email you had 20-30 faulty units at this time, we will proceed to advise our dispatch centre to replace 1:1 with spares available aboard our next available form of priority transport tonight, to ensure no delay in your request. Please provide your phone number for delivery and your preferred address - regards.

So for added context, since the new building was still somewhat under construction - not many other tenants are in the building yet. As such, it's a very quiet building at the time - most of the front-of-house professional concierges are seasoned Vet's if you will.

Later on that week I get a call from Concierge who's advising me that we have a delivery downstairs. My immediate reaction is well if it's only maybe 10-20 right I'll just quickly take the down elevator and pick it up no need for a trolley or wheels. Arrive at the concierge and there are pallet loads, they're trying to fit the pallet through a sizeable revolving door at Concierge whilst being yelled at it needs to go down an (at the time unmarked) delivery dock behind the building complex. 

They had shipped how many we were after and then some, so much so that we only barely had enough space in our tenancy which thankfully had its own dedicated IT build-room area, think a well-lit storage room with power and patch panels all the way along with a table jutting in running along the perimeter of the wall. The kind you wish you had during a laptop refresh project but better. We didn't ask for mice but presumably, they came complimentary as well. 

**End of Edit**

**Minor edits below for continuity reasons post edit, wording, tense, etc**

The response from that point forward from their Helpdesk for other bits and bobs, peripheral replacement - hardware repairs, etc from that point forward was quite literally on the bleeding edge. We ended up having a certified Tech come on-site daily regardless of whether or not we had issues alongside a separate AV guy who was also on-site every day regardless of whether or not we had lodged any tickets with their company either. 

I sincerely miss ""big"" IT but I think I've gained so much working at smaller orgs being able to branch out and such that I can't imagine going back. I will admit the words **""you have the authority to redirect cargo planes in flight""** was a bit of a stretch, but suffice to say I'm pretty sure after the beatdown they received we became the sole centre of the universe for most Dell branded things temporarily for this technician and his line manager - understandably so as I can only imagine the levels of management that were CC and BCC'd in correspondence. The feeling of being run around in circles to serene clarity I think is the best feeling to have, but I harbor no harsh feeling towards <Tech> or Helpdesk - they're just doing what they're told and what their guidebooks tell them to follow regardless of what common sense may dictate that <Tech> may very well have known or contextually picked up during his troubleshooting.",99,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF787400>
472,Woes in the Woods,"I saw /u/publiusvaleri_us 's tale about Crystal Power, and it reminded me of this tale early in my career where the customer's situation was much more memorable than the problem itself.

To set the stage, this was early in my career.  I had either just graduated or was about to graduate with my Information Systems degree from a college in the Southern United State's Bible Belt.  I had only lived in the south for about two years, having previously grown up in California.  So I spoke too fast for the people out there, and generally was a square peg in the round hole of most social interactions.

I worked for a local computer company, doing computer repair and troubleshooting, including on site visits.  I had a cell phone back in those days, but it was still a novelty.  If I needed directions for somewhere I checked the map in my car, or printed out directions from MapQuest that had a varying degree of accuracy.

We were based in a small city in the south, which meant our calls had a lot of variability between regular suburbs, small businesses, rural hospitals, and guys out in the middle of absolutely nowhere.  The subject today is one of the latter.

I drove for what seemed like forever down dirt roads in the woods.  We're talking super tall trees, windy roads with nebulous directions, nothing to see but woods in any direction.  I finally pull up to this house, an expensive looking mini-mansion in the middle of this wilderness.  Believe it or not, this wasn't uncommon.  This was the south, so someone fairly well off could buy up a large amount of land, and then build their dream home on it.  My Uncle did something similar on 40 acres with his telephone company salary, built a nice two story house.

This guy's place made my Uncle's house feel like a 2 bedroom suburb rental.

Tall, large, multiple rooms and at least two stories.  Early 20-something me was intimidated as I pulled up and entered the house.

> $Customer: You hear to fix my damn son's damn computer?

> $Me: Absolutely.  Where's it at?

> $Customer: Follow me.  

He leads me up the stairs and into a darkened room.  He bellows at his son, only a few years younger than me at *most*, to get out of bed.

> $Customer: The computer guy is here to fix your damn computer!  Get up!

The poor son hops out of bed, pulls on some pants and a shirt.  I say nothing, I can feel the embarassment in the air, and I want to do nothing more but to fix this and get out of this situation.

They describe the problem to me, and as with so many problems of the day, it was a malware infection caused by unwise use of Limewire.  (Google it, kids.)  I set about removing any malicious software and removing the file sharing software.

As I work I hear rusting from the bed.  $Son is standing nearby.  $Customer has left the room.  I turn to glance at the source of the noise.

$Girlfriend is still in bed, holding up a sheet to protect her modesty.  

> $Girlfriend: ""Is this going to take long?""  

$Son grimaces, and looks even more embarassed.

This was too much for poor socially awkward younger me, and I worked as expeditiously as I could to nope the heck out of there as quickly as possible.  $Son asked me a few questions and tried to be generally as sociable as you could be when his girlfriend was presumably less than dressed.  Why she didn't ask me to leave the room for a moment so she could change I couldn't tell you.  I think I was too startled to suggest it myself, plus the customer was in a sour mood and had expressed a desire for expedience.  Add that together with my relative inexperience, and I just soldiered on.

The best part, as I recall, was when I was done, $Customer came back in the room as I explained what caused the issues, what I did to fix them, and how to avoid them in the future.  $Son looked properly chagrinned the entire time, while his $girlfriend was nonplussed in the bed while we had the discussion.",18,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF787460>
473,Cookies and computers don't mix,"Obligatory first time poster and not actually employed in IT.  But this is indeed a tale of tech support and so it shall go in TFTS.  Also might be a bit wordy for a simple thing, but that's just how my brain works.

The other day, I'm chatting with a few friends on discord and finishing up my lunch, when I get a ping from a discord thread.  I go over and look, and lo and behold it's a friend asking for tech support.  The problem: Her computer won't turn on due to the cooling fan not working and she's got a class in a hour.  I'm still free for a little while, and she seems a bit worried, so I go ahead into a discord call.  Sidenote: I've told her I'm writing this story and she says there's one condition: I have to call her laptop Cheryl.  So from now on Cheryl refers to the laptop.

First thing, of course, is just try turning on Cheryl again.  Cooling fan still isn't working.  
You might criticize the jump here, but I had a feeling something was blocking the fan, and I tell her we'll need to take the laptop apart.  I guide her through taking out the battery, and immediately we get an indication of the problem.  There is a fine layer of white powder under the battery.

This immediately triggered a memory, of about 6 months ago.  She enjoys baking, and often brings Cheryl onto video calls while baking.  She sets Cheryl often not that far in front of her, and uses her messy fingers to type.  All of this I have warned her against in the past, to no avail.  This specific time, however, she left a pile of flour next to the intake fan.  Somehow this took 6+ months to finally build enough flour to bring that fan to a stop.

Alright, so we get to the fan and it's clearly stopped up with flour.  I suggest taking the fan out and using some compressed air to blow out the flour.  The fan needs a lot more effort than we have time to get it out, it turns out.  The next suggestion I have is to try using a brush of some kind to get the flour out.  She grabs a small paintbrush and goes in and cleans it... I watch her brush out this fan for about 3-4 minutes, pulling out impressive amounts of flour every time.  Finally, it's done, Cheryl boots, and everything is right with the world again, right as the clock strikes the hour.

Before she went to her class, she tells me: ""Where's the noise?""  I'm fearing a speaker got disconnected or something... before realizing that she was referring to the fan noise.  
The next day, she joins a video call.  She's in her kitchen, baking 150 cookies, with the computer in the same position as before.  Sigh... I guess some people never change...",27,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF7874C0>
474,The Tale of the Impenetrable Kayak or How I learned to stop worrying and love the suck,"(Obligatory long time reader first time poster)

Forgive my formatting I have no excuse I am trash.

I recently recounted this tale with a coworker of mine and it made me realize it would probably entertain at least two of y'all. 

Cast:

Me: Me (Tier 1 lackey for a midsize WISP)

Customer: CX

Lead: A lovable rollover who gives minimal push back on escalations much to my chagrin

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Our tale started off pretty normal working on my game remotely from my desk while waiting for calls or tickets, when I hear my headset ring.

Me: -Intro.exe-

CX: -ignores my request for a phone number- Hey since I got home I've noticed my internet has been running like crap it won't even load a youtube video on the lowest resolutions

Me: well that's not good mind giving me your phone number so I can take a look for ya?

CX: oh yeah sorry -provides number-

Me: alright one sec 

&#x200B;

I start looking everything over and everything looks darn near perfect except maybe his radio has an uptime of 255 days (if my memory serves me)

&#x200B;

Me: well I don't see anything obvious are you at the location (he's clearly not as I can hear his truck)

CX: no but I'm like a minute a way from being there

Me: -rolling my eyes as people say this but mean 5-10 minutes away- uh sure if it'll be that quick but it's no rush if you need time

CX: naw actually I'm pulling up now

Me: awesome 

&#x200B;

As he gets inside I have him power-cycle every damn thing along the way radio, router, desktop and he's seeing like maybe 1 mbps on a 100 plan. I'm checking the settings on our rtr the dish everything when I make an offhand comment to my lead.

&#x200B;

Me: it's so weird everything was looking fine yet his connection is crap even bypassed the router. 

Lead: well just notate the ticket and send it up

Me: nah something is up I'm telling you I need to find it even if it's just for my self.

Lead: -Laughs- alright not on me if your averages take a hit

&#x200B;

At this point I'm on a mission to figure out what was going on, when I notice his signal which was at a great strength has dropped significantly I didn't notice it at first as I had already check it and it hadn't dropped low enough to alert me. So at this point I had the cx go out and visually inspect the dish to make sure it was pointed correctly and had clear LOS. While he was checking I looked at his install pictures and bam the dish was on the edge of the from roof over top of the garage.

&#x200B;

Me: Is there anything on or in your truck that could be blocking the dish?

CX: Hmmm well I do have...oh shit it's my kayak it's been on my truck since my trip cause I didn't feel like taking it off do you think that could be it?

Me: roll your truck forward out of the LOS and I'll tell ya

So the cx jumped in his truck rolled it forward and boom like magic his signal skyrocket back to normal.

475,"Somewhere in here there's a ""I'm not locked in here with you"" joke...","Some background will probably help. I managed a tech support team. However, the product we offer support to doesn't actually belong to our company. So my team mainly acts as a Tier 1/Tier 2 answering questions we know the answers to and opening tickets with vendor's Tier 3 when we know something isn't working.

Because of that, we don't have real administrator access to our machines. Not in the way that desktop support would have. Justification had always been that my team doesn't *need* it and they keep admin/super user access restricted on that criteria.

To make it so we can get our work done, we have many home brew tools and scripts that we run. There's a formal company policy for user solutions, we follow it to the 'T', but our software is our own - MIS does not support it because MIS didn't build it.

We do a lot with databases. As an entire department, not just my team, for one reason or another you're going into an Access database multiple times a day. Several years ago we noticed a bunch of challenges with that approach. Namely that... let's say... less technically inclined employees... had a history of causing havoc when unleashed into the database. They'd treat it like a spreadsheet. Accidentally delete data... move stuff around... it was a whole mess.

Couple that with some of these users needed somewhat sophisticated queries built. And trying to teach them SQL was an exercise in futility. So what was decided is we would not provide most employees with Access itself. Instead we can use ActiveX controls to connect to an Access file, and provided you had the right DLLs installed, you could query the database with a web front end. Zero chance of someone messing up the data because, they had no way to do so. You put your parameters in the web front end, and the webpage crafted the SQL query for you and displayed the results on the page.

With that background done...

Actually worked great as a solution. Then one day things stopped working. Investigating I found out that it was because our Office had updated, so we now had 64-bit DLLs. And IE (the only browser we have with ActiveX) was 32-bit. So I reach out to the help desk who actually have admin rights to the desktop environments to help. They insist that we have a 64-bit IE, and I just need to use that. So I show them it doesn't work.

Then, the ticket escalates. The next tier tells me I need to talk to whoever wrote the software. I told them that's me, there's nothing wrong with the code - it's the environment and I can't make changes to the environment. They basically argued with me again and again that the code is bad. Finally I get them to set up a test VM with just 32-bit Office? And it totally works. Further, the 32-bit Office works with what's supposed to be the 64-bit IE. Proving that what we were saying is 64-bit clearly isn't.

So the ticket escalates one last time, and things get honestly contentious. The support people don't feel like they should have to help me, that (again) something is clearly wrong with the script. In response I make the most minimal implementation possible. Just enough code to connect to a database and output the user agent to the console \[not a reliable way of telling if it's 32-bit or not but better than nothing\]. Excluding the JS library that was doing all the heavy lifting... I had like 4 lines of code in the sample script.

The next call we get on there's about 7 Desktop Support people, I show them this new script. Show them it doesn't work with 64-bit office. I ask them to test it on a VM with 32-bit Office and as the arguments start up, I tell them ""for the last time, it's not the code, it's the environment"".

Some loudmouth guy, who I don't recognize for any previous meeting, starts to brow beat me about how I'm wasting everyone's time.

All you have to do is give me something in writing explaining we don't support 64-bit IE, and I can take it to my manager and we can write up a demand letter"".  
>  
>LM: ""We do have 64-bit IE""  
>  
>Me: ""We don't, because it can't work with he 64-bit DLLs. Only the 32-bit. Watch, set up a VM with 32-bit Office and it will work"".  
>  
>LM: ""Why do we have to do that? Why aren't you setting up a VM?""  
>  
>Me: ""Because Desktop Support won't grant me or my team admin access. I can't install or uninstall software or setup VMs.""  
>  
>LM: ""Anyone in MIS should have admin rights""  
>  
>Me: ""I'm not in MIS""  
>  
>LM: ""So why are you writing software?""  
>  
>Me: ""Because there's a Risk policy that allows us to do so, and all of our controls are in place. If you don't like that policy, take it up with Risk. I'm not asking you to troubleshoot my code, I'm asking you to troubleshoot Internet Explorer and that's 100% you guys""  
>  
>LM: ""Fine, someone on the call set up a VM"".

And someone does and low and behold... it runs fine in 32-bit Office and 32-bit IE. I then again tell them to try it with 32-bit Office and **64-bit IE** (Loudmouth objects, says it won't work) and... it runs fine with 32-bit Office and ""64""-bit IE.

At that point, LM stayed quiet for the rest of the meeting.  Finally setting up a call with Microsoft, the vendor confirmed... Yep... that's not 64-bit IE. We don't know what your company did, but... those are two 32-bit IEs. And when Microsoft broke down their suggestions, Desktop Support decided to formally declare that 64-bit IE will not be available or supported.

Granted, IE is now dead but... we had something like 18 months to get to another solution and instead we suddenly found ourselves in the lurch.

I wrote LM's manager about how unprofessional he was, and if anyone on my team talked that way to a client or service partner they'd be lucky if all I did was write them up.

Of course, never heard a response. Someone like that either has a laundry list of complaints, but for some reason no one will discipline him, or he learned it from his manager.

Not really a 'happy' ending but at least I could get on with my life.",33,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF787580>
476,"Crystal power is down? I'll be right over, ma'am","I accidentally ended up in the phone book as a computer repair company. I swear this happened. It was around 2007. The company I started had a ""technology"" type name. So when I declined repeated attempts at obtaining a Yellow Pages ad (and almost never answering my phone because I was busy kick-starting my business), the crazy marketing people at the local ""Bell"" company threw me into the ""Computer Repair Services"" category of the published directory. And I was at the top of the list alphabetically. Why me?!

After a while of ignoring the calls, well, I just went with it. The company I was starting was having funding issues and was slow to develop, so I just started going on service calls when someone would call me to fix their computer. I just charged a lot and made it worth my while.

So I got a call about Microsoft Outlook corruption or something really lame like that. Remember Outlook .pst files? Pretty sure it was some kind of software issue on a Windows XP box. I went to the house in a very rural area. Way out in the boondocks. Super slow Internet. The lady was older, and not very computer savvy. But I needed to save her PC from corrupted data files or some such. I think it had a failing (or full?) 40 GB hard drive, or something that would take a lot of time to fix but was not a difficult problem. The main issue was that her business was ""down"" and I had to get it back up again, even temporarily.

Then we got to talking. The lady really needed her computer fixed because there were business transactions at stake. She was selling big ticket items and the customers needed her to answer questions and ship the items fast.

I am not normally one to get distracted from business and let my eyes wander off my task...

But this was different. I was apparently inside the lair of one of the most sacred and illustrious sites for **crystal power** in the whole country. Because my customer would speak some kind of enchanted spell over these crystals that she found, and sell them on eBay for about 100 times their worth as minerals. She pointed around the eerily-dim room at her numerous crystals that were given spooky names and explain that each one had been carefully ""energized"" by whatever powers she claimed existed in the area. Her house was full of these colorful crystals, some sitting under triangles or hexagons or strange lighting. Maybe she grew them, I don't know.

But sure enough, once I fixed the PC (probably a full hard drive) I perused her broken email box. I came across numerous excited emails with questions pertaining to the **power or energy** of a particular rock that she was selling. I'm talking about crystals in the hundred dollar plus range. She bragged about crystals going for well over $200.

Well, I hate to say that I was her enabler. I eventually got her PC running again, installed a new hard drive, charged her an arm and a leg for my time, and went back to screening my calls.

477,The I in VOIP stands for Internet,"Happened to me today. In 2021.  
  
I work for a VOIP telecom company in a tier III group whose primary customers are small and medium sized businesses. We work tickets that (should) have been vetted and troubleshooting has already been performed. We do **not** take inbound calls from customers unless we reach out to them on an active ticket and gave our direct callback number.  
  
Around 3:30p today my phone started ringing. It's common to get spam calls and I hadn't lleft any messages so I ignored it. Then the number called again. And a third time. By the fourth call I finally picked up.  
  
**Me**: Thank you for calling VOIPcom. This is Neekogo, how can I help you?  
  
*Caller*: Hi Neekogo! Im with (random customer company) and we are hard down. My boss told me to call you because if anyone could get us working it's you Neekogo!  
  
**Me**: (super confused) umm....that's not how this normally works. Do you have a ticket or case number for reference?  
  
*Caller*: No we don't but here's our account number.  
  
While she's on the phone searching my systems trying to figure out how who they are and how they got my direct unpublished number. I find nothing but figure I must've worked on a previous issue and they saved my number.  
  
**Me**: Okay so my group doesn't take direct customer calls for issues. You'll need to create a case at our website VOIPcom.com and one of our agents will open a ticket with my group if they are unable to get you working.   
  
*Caller*: No I can't do that. I have no access.  
   
**Me**: Well there's a chat bot to assist you as well.   
  
*Caller*: No, I can't get to the website at all.  
  
**Me**: Wait you have no access at all? You can't get to any website? VOIPcom.com? Google? Facebook?  
  
*Caller*: Nope, it's all down.  
  
**Me**: Okay, now this is starting to make sense. Your phone service with us requires internet access. If your internet is down then it makes sense your phones are hard down. This is either your network equipment or it's your ISP. You'll probably need to reach out to your ISP. Until then your phones aren't going to work.  
  
*Caller*: (slightly disappointed I can't fix it) oh, okay. Thank you. <click>
   
  
After she hung up I sat at my desk for a few minutes just flabbergasted. Yes, your VOIP phone service does require Internet to work.",104,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF787640>
478,and then FIRE shoot out.....,"This occurred in 2000.

Customer was a chiropractor who, against our strongest recommendation, purchased an e-Machine which was about the lowest budget machine you could get. Proprietary power supply, cramped layout, minimal expansion ports. He purchased it so he could do medical dictation for his patient visits, so three weeks later he came back and purchased a $300 sound card because the built in sound card was crap.

Critical to the story are another customer, a Colorado 250 tape backup, and our policy of always powering up and testing a machine - in the presence of the customer - before taking it into the repair queue. We'd make any notes and then customer would sign off on those notes. No signature....no repairs.

This customer was a pain the butt. Every 3-4 weeks they'd call or come in complaining about how slow it was, or how poorly the speech-to-text engine worked, etc., etc. Unfortunately I was the new guy so whenever he came in the store there would be a mad scramble to the back and I'd find myself the only one at the tech bench.

One quiet mid-week afternoon I suddenly realize I'm all alone (except for a browsing customer). With a sinking feeling I look across to the parking lot and...there it is. That car. And oh HECK no....he's unloading his PC this time. Son-of-a-motherless goat.....

In he comes, stomping his way back to the tech bench. I plastered on a fake smile and this is what ensued:

*Me:* ""Good aftern....""

**Dr. Butthead:** ""That piece of crap software isn't working right again and I need it fixed tonight.""

(At this point my cowardly co-workers trickle out of the back as they see I'm fully trapped and can't escape.)

*Me:* ""Dragon Dictate?""

**Dr. B:** ""I never should have bought anything from you people. This whole thing has been a pile of crap. I want it fixed.""

*Me:* ""Well let's hook it up and you can show me what it's doing.""

**Dr. B:** ""I don't have time for that, I'm just dropping it off and I need it fixed by Friday.""

*Me:* ""Well we have to hook it up and boot into Windows before we can take it in for service.""

**Dr. B:** ""It boots up just fine. I don't have time, I have an appointment.""

*Me:* ""Well I'm sorry, but to protect our customers our policy is that we can't take it in for service without you signing off on the condition when you dropped it off.""

**Dr. B:** ""Look, I don't have to sign anything. I bought it here and you guys warranty it so you have to fix it. This is bull. I know my rights.""

*Me (almost done hooking it up):* ""Well, I'm almost ready to turn it on so just give me another minute and we'll print out the intake form and you can be on your way. Tell me exactly what it's been doing?""

**Dr. B:** ""Well when I try to record any patient notes it just says unable to save patient data.""

*Me:* ""Can you load other patient files?""

**Dr. B:** ""No like I said, it isn't working and you need to fix it. Again.""

*Me (about to hit the power button):* ""Well have you been backing up up your files?""

**Dr. B:** ""Yes, of course I have, do you think I'm stupid?""

*Me:* ""No sir, I was just asking in case we have to restore any data.""

***<hitting power button>***

**>>>>> *KAPOW* <<<<<**

....and then FIRE SHOOT OUT!!!!!

As in six to eight inches of bluish mixed with ugly orange flames shot out of the power supply fan intake for about 2 seconds, then it belched a cloud of foul, fried electronic smell, black greasy smoke and fell silent.

**Dr. B (screaming):** ""WHAT THE F\*\*\* DID YOU DO? I DON'T HAVE ANY BACKUPS YOU JACKASS!""

Eventually, when the dust (and smoke) cleared, and after several calls with the owner, he decided not to sue. I think the deciding factor was that the other customer in the store had heard him both say he had been doing his backups, and then post-boom loudly declare he didn't have any backups.

479,"General Protection Failure, who you gonna COM?","Another Windows 98 GPF. Reboot, hope the fabrication wasn't at a critical point, start back up again.

I sighed. Windows 98 SE had gone out of support in 2003 or so, and here I am, in 2018, staring at a GPF on a 1280x1024 LCD, itself 20"" or more, with pixels like lego, embedded in a sixteen ton fabrication machine with a factory built around it.

The machine used to be used for highly precise structural steel forming now it's used for training and demonstration. The original supplier went bust, Siemens bought up the smouldering remains, this old piece of crap was EoLed. Except, mechanically, it's a perfectly good steel fabrication system.

They log a ticket with central IT to ask if anyone could ""see if this old system could be brought back"". I'm passing through the city, so my director asks me to check in ""and if we need to, tell them to shut up and put their hands in their pockets""

The metal fabrication people give me a tour of the factory saying ""We're the only part of the company which is actually a manufacturing business, we do PLM, the works."" I knew this, as I was the IT contact for their PLM software (Teamcenter if anyone's heard of it) but it was nice to see what they got up to ""on the ground"".

We arrived at the fabrication machine, partly embedded in the building structure.

""When we expanded the factory, we had to leave this in place as it's actually structural!"" said one of the overalls, as though it was some ticket of pride.

I got under the control panel of the machine, which looked extremely industrial, but was really just a keyboard, a trackball, and a monitor. For however cool it looked, it was a 15 pin VGA D-Sub, PS/2 keyboard and PS/2 mouse connectors. The controlling machine was screwed to a motherboard tray, and seemed to be a fairly standard late-1990s PC. The Socket 5 or Socket 7 (didn't check) CPU was under a massive (by the day's standard) all-copper heatsink and running entirely passively. Three decades of humidity had put a lovely verdigris on the copper.

""Hey, what's this ISA card?"" I called out to nobody in particular.

""That's the industrial controller board. Key to the kingdom. Work out what that does, and we're laughing.""

So I uncoupled it and pulled it.

Back where breathing didn't need filters and the the words ""corrosion"" and ""computer"" didn't appear in the same sentence, I'm investigating the ISA card and I've got a young lad pulling an old desktop from stores which the site field engineer tells me has an ISA port.

In the unlucky Dell Dimension, Windows XP shows us an ISA card, but it's not recognised, no driver. EISA PnP did use proper device IDs and, looking up the ID, showed it as a completely unregistered ID. Ergo, it was proprietary and ""faking"" the PnP standard.

The ISA card itself had your usual  74LS245 octal bus transceivers, used to buffer the ISA bus, and a larger socketed DIP-28 with a sticker on it. 

When investigating these weird cards, you need to always bear in mind that some industrial equipment manufacturer is not going to design its own interface chip. What interested me was a DIP-40, pin-thru-hole (everything else was socketed), which routed some lines to a pair of MC145406Ps, very common RS-232 transceivers, which then went to the rear port: We had two RS-232 serial ports here.

So the card went ISA > 74LS245 bus buffer > Unknown DIP-40 + DIP-28 > Two RS-232s.

I said to my chaperones, ""We're not getting this worked out today, I'm going to have to take it with me.""

I did some trace tracing back in the build lab. We definitely had two RS-232s going to one port., but what was this DIP-40? I tried my best to reverse engineer its pin out. I also posted on a forum ""What has 40 pins and two serial ports?"" to which someone responsed to with ""MC68681 dual UART, without a doubt"".

This broke it: An MC68681 dual UART with a PnP EPROM. However, a simple MC68681 would never be able to be a ""real"" EISA PnP device, so this is where the vendor faked it, which had the result of the OS not recognising it, so the other part of the EPROM (which I dumped) simply acted as fake ""jumpers"" to configure the IRQ (locked on IRQ11 and 12) and COM port (6 and 7) assignments.

The proprietary software for it checked for the weird PNP device, which was installed with a shim driver, a null device by just looking for the file. It then assumed COM6 and COM7.

I mapped the pinout, which really was just two serial ports in one connector, configured a Windows 7 machine with two USB serial adapters to use COM6 and COM7, installed the software in DOSBox with ""realport"",  had an adapter made up for the physical connection, bought a a USB to dual PS/2 from Amazon, and sent down a laptop with all that on to ""test if this works"".

They were overjoyed. Not only did the laptop work, (and pass all margin tests) but it had all been commoditised. The fabrication machine went back into work, eating data files still produced by modern software, and producing steel in the right shape with the right holes.

As far as I know, they're still using it today.",30,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF787700>
480,He Said It Was OK,"Years ago around oh, say, 2003 ~ish I worked for a small Mom & Pop shop that sold, supported and repaired PC's. We were in a rather sketchy part of the neighborhood, so you never knew what would come your way. 

There was myself, who did both sales and repairs, two other techs, a salesperson and the boss. Oh, and the boss' wife, who handled all the admin tasks.

An older lady came in one day with a Beige Box, which had an old ECS mainboard, the kind with integrated everything...and with nearly all the caps swelling or burst open. Amazingly, this PC still ran. It was running Windows 2000. Myself and one of the other techs talked with her, and suggested she not invest any money into the computer as it wasn't practical.

She decides that it's time to move on, and asks us to recycle it for her. No problem.

Now, my co worker (same one who spoke with the lady) is looking over this PC, ""you know, this ain't that bad a PC, put Windows Server on there and it's be great!"" I mention that I guess it would work as a server, but don't really say anything other than agree to his sentiment. So my co worker decides at the end of the day....he's taking it home.

Now, for those of you who have been in the business long enough, you know once you get rid of something, you inevitably will need it sooner or later. This story is no different.

The next day I come into work, the tech who took the PC home is off that day. Guess who visits the service counter? The lady from the previous day. Only, she's changed her mind about recycling the PC. She'd like it back. My heart literally stops and I get a cold sweat. (Those of you in the business, again, you know this feeling all to well) I excuse myself while I see about getting the PC, and head to the management area where the boss' wife is. I say to her: ""We have a problem, and I'm not sure how to handle this."" I explain that a customer decided to recycle a PC the other day, and Tech #1 took it home. Now, this lady is back, and she's changed her mind.

I get to stand there while she calls Tech #1 and she basically asks him what right he has to do what he did. Apparently, he claimed that I said it would be OK. She retorts with: ""Oh? So Tech #3 is the go to guy for this?"" She ends her call, accompanied me to the counter and has to explain to the customer that her PC is not there, along with the reason. The customer didn't understand why Tech #1 would take the PC, but was willing to wait for it to be returned.

Tech #2, myself and boss' wife have a brief conversation about things, at which point she hopes when the PC is returned, ""it better be broken just the way it was"". Tech #2 talks with me about the situation and guarantees me that Tech #1 won't be fired, because he knows too much about how the tills and network operate. But he is just as upset about the situation as we once again have to play cleanup.

I can't recall if it was that same day or the next, but the PC was returned. However it was brought in by Tech #1's brother. That's right, Tech #1 didn't bring it, and also didn't show up for work cause he was home ""sick"".

Tech #2 and myself boot up the PC to find it's been erased and a fresh install of Windows 2000 Server has been installed. Oh joy. So at this point, we have to rummage around and find a copy of Windows 2000 that we can put back on this PC, because we need to get it back to the point where it left. Now, because this is an ECS board and ECS didn't exactly have the best support, getting the driver's took a while. After all, Windows 2000 wasn't a mainstream OS anymore, not for 3 years now.

I remember Tech #2 cursing the entire time he was fixing the PC.

Finally, the lady came and picked up the PC, and of course, we apologized for the situation.

True to his prediction, Tech #1 was not fired. I got to ""enjoy"" working with him for many years.

This was the start of me learning many lessons the hard way although, mostly I was caught in the middle. I have at least one other big story about working for this company, but that will be another post, another day......",29,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF787760>

482,"I'm back again, with a story of finding parts and inventory for service work.","I feel like some of you may understand this, especially when working with personal devices.  Once in a while, there are people seeking to throw out office equipment, in my line of work, it's typewriters.  It's a shame to see those machines go to the dump, so people are often looking for shops to donate them to, or places to sell to.  I specialize in service work and I also sell to users and collectors around the world. 

Cue the people (proper cue this time) who ring me up because they've come across my socials, my website, Google, or the news, and ask me if I know of anyone who buys or accepts donations.  Um, yes, I do in fact know someone very close to me: myself.   The typical conversation involves me explaining the work I do, and then the person asking again if I know of anyone who'd take them.  Yes, I do.  I take them.  I get them into the hands of those who will use them.  I'll even give money for them.  Then they tell me that they'll think about it, mention how it's a shame to think of tossing them, and if I know of anyone to let them know.  omfg.  They tell me they'll keep in touch, they never do. 

What's worse is the lady two towns over who had a whole plethora of old IBM parts, tools, and manuals.  I repair IBMs for personal and business use, parts are hard to come by, and tools are near impossible to find.  I told her I'd absolutely take the lot, she sends me pictures.  Tells me that she wants them to go to a repair shop to be used, they're free.  I tell her absolutely!  I specialize in repairing typewriters.  She says ""tell me what you want.""  I tell her I want it all, that I'll pick it up, and that ill even pay if she wants.  I swear to God I'm not shitting you when I say she tells me she'll think about it, but would prefer a REPAIR MAN TO TAKE THEM.  OH MY GODDJDJSLAODUFJFHSHA SERIOUSLY??????  IT'S BEEN ALMOST A YEAR AND IT STILL PISSES ME OFF.  PEOPLE DO NOT LISTENNNNNN.  ...... okay.  Okay... so I wait.

Typewriters.  She goes oh, okay, and asks if I'd like to see some machines she has for sale too.  I say yes, I point out the ones I want and tell her the prices I'm willing to pay, all open to negotiation.  She tells me... well, you guessed it, that she WANTS THEM TO GO TO A REPAIR MAN.  I quit after that.  She can flush it for all I care.  Done.  Hands brushed.  No no no no no, no more.  Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk.  Or is this a Dr. Phil episode.  Idk.",46,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF787820>
483,I wonder what this button does?,"A bit of background: I started out in Computer Operations before IT even existed, working for a big financial institution in the northern UK. 


So back in the early days, the mainframes were up on the third floor with the printers, while the tape units and disk drives were kept on the second floor, separated by a glass wall with a glass door in it. Each location had terminals with system messages appropriate to its function, but we kept in touch via the intercom.


One day, the big boss came down from on high with his big boss buddies, showing them around the 'shop'. He waved vaguely at us lowly tape operators and said something to his mates and they all laughed; we couldn't hear them above the noise from all the tape drives and the disk drives through the wall. Then he led them through the door to the disk room.


Moments later, we found we could all hear perfectly, as the tape drives died. As the door opened, we also heard the disk drives powering themselves down. Big boss appeared, face as white as a sheet. He wasn't laughing now.


Just then, the intercom burst into life. ""Is everything ok down there? The mainframes seem to have frozen up.""


That was the first and the last time I ever saw a guided tour of our facility.",52,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF787880>

485,Laptop home-cooking,"**Forward, unrelated to events of tale**- So, if any of you read this and go ""Man, this story seems really familiar... why do I feel like I read this 5-6 years ago""- it is indeed because I did post it 5-6 years ago along with quite a few other stories. Those stories done got me fired from my first IT job, but not before they gave me time to delete them. (That's a whole different story)

**The Story (tl;dr at the end)**

So, at the time I was working at an internal helpdesk on the West coast >!pronounced 'best coast'!< for a company that primarily owns grocery stores. We'll call them ""**Company**"". 

I worked Desktop support, so I was primarily helping office workers and with people in back offices of stores. 

>*ring ring*

>Me- ""Desktop Support, this is BaileyTheNerd, how can I help you?""

>User- ""Yeah, I brought my laptop home from the office and I've got a blue screen, I need your help getting back to my desktop- I have a lot of things I'm working on"" 

(Note at this time, the only users with laptops they could bring home were office/corporate workers, complete with inflated ego) 

>Me- ""Alright, we'll see what we can do, are there any prompts on the screen?"" 

(I walk him through troubleshooting, but the dang thing is seized up on top of the blue screen, all that's really left to try is a hard reboot) 

>Me- ""Sorry sir, but I don't think we're getting anywhere here, we're going to have to force reboot"" 

>User- ""No."" 

>Me- ""I'm sorry? I'm afraid that's really our last option, as we've tried everything else"" 

>User- ""I can't lose all the work I've had going since the office""

>Me- ""Well, what programs were you using? There's a good chance that most of them have some kind of autosave turned on, we might be able to salvage something."" 

(the user proceeds to list about 10 hacky internal programs that absolutely do **NOT** autosave)

>Me- ""I'm sorry sir, but none of those programs have an autosave function. You're likely going to lose all that work"" 

>User- ""NO. UNACCEPTABLE. **COMPANY** is going to lose tens of thousands of dollars worth of *my* work because **you** can't fix this. 

>Me- ""I guess we can try to figure out what happened to it and see if we can find a solution from there. Can you give me a rundown of the last time the laptop worked till now?"" 

>User- ""Well, it was working at the office yesterday. I finished work, I closed the laptop-"" 

>Me- ""Did you hibernate it or put it to sleep first?"" 

>User- ""No. Then I put it in my laptop bag, and drove home. It took a couple hours because it was snowing"" 

>Me- ""Okay, and you didn't use it when you got home?"" 

>User- ""No, I just got home, dropped all my stuff in front of the fireplace and warmed myself up before making dinner""

>Me- ""And you hadn't moved or touched the laptop between then and now?"" 

>User- ""No. Now, how do we fix my damn laptop"" 

>Me- ""Well, considering you left a running laptop inside of a laptop bag (blocking airflow), then had that same laptop inside of a heated car, then left that already hot laptop in front of a fireplace- I say we reboot it and hope it's not completely busted."" 

>User- ""Incredible. Do you have a supervisor I can talk to?"" 

>Me- ""Sure, give me a moment to get her on the line"". 

So I put the User on hold, I fill in my supervisor, and conference her in on the call. 

She effectively told him that our only option was to reboot, and any lost work was in NO WAY my fault, considering the conditions that lead to the laptop bluescreening. He was not happy, but made no complaints, considering I had noted everything he told me in the ticket and we could very easily find out who his boss was and contact him/her. 

**Tl;Dr-** Local user furious that I used my pyrokinesis from 600 miles away to cook his laptop after using telepathy to force him to never save his goddamn work. My crimes go unpunished, his work is lost. Lessons learned about leaving running laptops in bags in front of fireplaces.


**Epilogue-** I have a new job working hands-on IT (which is WAY more fun than entirely remote work), I get paid $10/hr than at that last IT job, and I get to roam around my city fixing stuff. So I guess it all worked out.",17,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF787940>
486,All the printers are down.,"This happened earlier this morning.  I'm a sys admin at small-ish company, about 120 users.

Anywho, user comes up to me and says that all the printers are down.  Based on my incredulous look she expands, and says she sent a job to three different printers and all three aren't printing, and that there are some errors displayed on all 3.

I walk to the first one, the large color printer.  Displaying a jam.  Open the right panels, pull the stuck paper out, cancel the print job, and then do a test copy.  The print job was like half a spreadsheet, clearly not intended for the size paper the printer was feeding. No issue.

Walk to the second printer, it's awaiting input because it's trying to feed from the bypass tray (manual paper feed).  Tap one of the other paper trays to force the printer to print on LTR size, it comes out and it's half a spreadsheet.  Sent to the printer by our user.

Walk to the third printer, same story as the second. 

Go back to the user's desk, explain it was her print job that stopped up the three printers, and ask her what she's trying to do.  Basically, she was trying to print a spreadsheet for her boss but had no idea how to tinker with the print dialogue in Excel to make it fit on a sheet of letter paper.  Rather than come to me with that question though, she went straight to ""the printer is broken.""

TL;DR - User was sending a custom size print job to three printers that didn't really know how to handle it.  Instead of asking how to properly print her spreadsheet, she blamed the printers.",24,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF7879A0>

User called in last week about an issue with outlook, so per usual i offered to remote in to see if there were errors, maybe enable logging to see what's up.

I suggested she swap her computer to 5ghz bandwidth and let her other devices stay on the 2.4 band..

She messages me today:

488,Hardware swap,"So I'm doing a hardware swap this morning. Nothing out of the ordinary swapping a user from desktop to laptop since most of my users are remote/hybrid and it's easier to travel with a laptop. 

I prefer for users to bring their old equipment in if possible, especially if they are a regular caller. So user arrives and has the old equipment in a Walmart bag, no big deal makes it easier to carry I guess. I walk the user through how to setup and connect to the docking station so they can use external monitors, she asks how mouse and keyboard will work so I point out the USB slots for her. She seems to understand and thanks me for the new setup. 

After she leaves I start taking things out of the bag and separating for end of lease return or recycling. There's a keyboard with all of the letters rubbed off, the PC and power supply and lastly the mouse. But this mouse was 'special'. Why was it special you ask? Because it was wet and now so was my hand. I don't know what was on it or how it got wet but needless that put a damper on my day.",32,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF787A60>
489,Power Matters,"This just happened a solid 30 minutes and two cups of coffee ago.

Back Story: Army, Deployed, IT. Not awake yet, Don't judge.

&#x200B;

So there I was walking to work one cold morning. It's seem as though in Kuwait, 15 Celsius (59 Degrees) is actually freezing cold. I think to myself that I should probably start wearing 'Winter' clothing. I got to Kuwait at the beginning of their Summer, so I'm used to their 120+ degree weather, rather then the 60's we are at now. 

My important task of the day? Install a new UPS for our Switch stack since our last one died. Our stack has been hard shutting off every night when they fill the generators. Once or twice they failed to come back up on their own, So it's time.

Due to circumstances prior to coming out here, my unit cannot buy our own equipment. This leaves us at the mercy of higher echelons to provide. Been roughly a solid 6 months since our last UPS died... But finally through the power of complaining enough we got a brand new UPS!

I get to the office and ensure there is no one working before I cut the power to the stack. Once off I unpack the UPS and hook it up and make it look all purty before connecting it to the wall. I plug it into the wall. 

Nothing

SlightPanic.Jpeg

I look back at the UPS and realize the self test button is also the power button

NoPanic.Jpeg

I press the button, self test happens with a beep followed by a green light, nothing

SlightPanic.Jpeg2

I grab the instructions and realize it says to hold the power button in for 3 seconds to power on.

NoPanic.Jpeg

I press the button in for 3 seconds, self test, green light, beep, nothing.

Panic.Jpeg

I look at the box and immediately see 120V/60hz in the product name. 

FeelKindaDumb.Jpeg.

Everything on base is 220V/120hz, I don't know why we would even have an UPS here that won't work. But that makes sense as to why we got it then lol.

I unplug everything from the UPS and remove it, and plug directly back into the wall, Nothing.

RealPanic.Jpeg.

I blew the breaker, Ops. Flipped the breaker switch and it powered up just fine. I got scared for a moment that when I blew the UPS I blew the Stack as well when it didn't turn back on when plugged into the wall.

It's too early for this shenanigan's. I'm bout to drink my third cup of coffee.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: Got a new UPS, wasn't the right power type, blew a breaker, and got upsetttispahgetti for a moment.

""it was acting up again""

I told her I will be there in 15min after my standup, but that will simply not do, she has a VERY IMPORTANT MEETING TO ATTEND.

I just sigh, excuse myself from my colleagues, drink the remainder of my coffee and head up.

She's already standing at the doorway of her office, gesturing me to hurry up. 

>*Her*: ""none of the programs respond, everything is acting weird, nothing works!!!""

>*Me*: ""have you tried restarting the laptop?""

>*Her*: ""no I can't do that it won't let me!""

***at this point I look down and see her headset is resting on top of the spacebar of the external keyboard, which I remove.*** 

>*Me*: ""hey look your headset was resting against the spacebar""

A look of mild panic settles in on her face and she angrily explains that this cannot be the case as she just set them before I came over.

I asked her to describe one of the issues she was having.

>*Her*: ""when I opened outlook it kept scrolling through the mails on its own""

I asked her to open Outlook and then I held down the spacebar and to nobodies surprise the ""error"" she reported replicated.

trying her hardest to look surprised

>*Me*: ""yeah that's crazy. Anyway, whatever caused it, it's gone now, if you've got any other problems, lemme know""

492,security? I'm too busy to think about that!,"Back in the olden days when I worked at a University as a sysadmin, my department assisted another department from time to time with computer issues.   This was pretty much okay but we were rather limited in what we did for them, and sometimes folks just didn't understand that.

Anyway, one day I get a call from our network security team, they've received notification that a computer in other department that we assist with is doing something bad, probably its infected, can I get it shut off?  They don't have the ability to kill the switchport its on, they will have to take the entire building offline.  Supposedly the switches in this building are so old they can't remotely manage them or something, but they can manage the upstream switch. 

They are able to give me enough information to identify a professor's lab so at least we know who to contact.   I look up the departments webpage, find the faculty list, professor's office number is listed so I call it.  A grad students answers, I explain what's going on, grad student talks to professor, grad student tells me professor is too busy to talk and he's using the computer, so no, he won't shut it down or disconnect it.   I call the administration person for the other department and explain that Professor X needs to shutdown his computer or bad things will happen.  No problem they'll contact him.  

Security guys call me back, the bad computer is still on the network.  I call over again.  Apparently Professor X will not listen to anyone, he's busy.  The computer is still up and running, and connected.  I explain again, your entire department is going to be disconnected if X doesn't shutdown his machine, or at least unplug the network cable.  

Admin folks explain that they don't have the authority to make X do anything.   I suggest they escalate to the head of their department RIGHT NOW.   I call the security guys and explain what's going on, they tell me they will pull the plug.  I explain, I have no authority over this department, or this professor, or anything, we just help them out from time to time.  I don't have access to the wiring closets so I can't disconnect him from the switch.  As a matter of fact, the security guys shouldn't have called me anyway, we don't support faculty machines for the other department at all.  

Security asks if I'll walk over to the other building and try to talk to Professor X.   No, I have no authority, I'm trying to get the Dept Head to handle it, he has the authority.    The admin person calls me, Professor X has told them that he won't shut down or disconnect the computer, if the security guys need to unplug the whole building, that's fine with him he needs his computer running and connected.  Apparently he doesn't realize that his computer is going to be off the network one way or another, the only question is how many other folks are going down also.  

Finally Professor X realizes he better do what he's been asked, or a whole lot of folks are going to be pretty mad at him, so he unplugs his network cable.     Sometime later he got his system patched and I had a meeting with the Head of the department on what they should do.  I said they could hire a sysadmin/network person and give them authority to disconnect machines that had problems, that was how it was handled in my department.  Of course they didn't have the budget for that so it didn't happen.

Eventually the switches in that building got upgraded so that the security guys could shutdown individual ports, which pretty much solved the problem.",38,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF787BE0>
493,"It's not always on and off again, it's ""did you pull the leaver?""","I always imagine myself going ""PULL THE LEVER KRONK!"" over the phone...but that would be unprofessional.

Side note, hope I ain't breaking the anonymity rule... just pretend you can't see my user.

Anyway, allow me to introduce myself to the sub, I am a typewriter repair and service technician by trade.  You may be wondering to yourself, ""who needs tech support for typewriters?""  Excuse me while I take a break for a hearty laugh.  

Apparently a lot of people do.

So allow me to rifle through my rolodex of amazing stories of unplugged tech support and bring to you a young man's perspective of a dying and sometimes annoying industry.  If I don't get kicked outta here, I have more ;)

Anyway, allow me to paint a picture of a generic portable typewriter.  It comes in a case with a handle for portability.  However, in order to protect it inside the case, most machines come equip with a small lever to keep it all locked up.  Cue many calls of typewriters ""not working,"" which I normally handle with poise and patience (if I do say so myself).

HOWEVER there will invariably be this old fart who knows more about typewriters than some 21 year old city boy because they've been around the block a few times and grew up with them.  I have since retired the tirade of ""I've seen machines you didn't even know existed etc etc"" because it's lame and frankly...unprofessional.  instead I politely ask the age old question, ""have you tried turning it off and on again?"" Which in typewriter language is said as follows: ""have you unlatched the carriage lock?""  

""Oh yes I have, I know how to use my typewriter, every time i press a key nothing happens"" seller said it was working blah blah blah.

Either they bring it into me and I smugly pull a lever and type away, or I circle it in a photo they sent me.  It's really thankless work.  Sometimes, yes, it is genuinely broken, hence why everything must be approached with neutrality.  But it really is something to see someone who thinks they're all knowing be foiled by a lever.

The levers also apply to paper release and the age old mimeograph settings.... a story for another time.  And don't get me started on DIN numbers.... God help me.

494,A broken clock is always wrong,"A broken clock is always wrong

Background: 
I am filling in for our sysadmin as we attempt to hire and onboard a new person. As such, all tickets for Frontline and sysadmin are landing in my desk. Also, we are an institution of higher learning. On to the show. 

Arrived in the office Wednesday morning, opened our help desk ticketing software, It started to process from the afternoon/evening list of tickets which were minor, until I got to the Entitled Professor. 

EP: The clock in #classroombuilding is not functioning, despite having tried fresh batteries.

ME: hello EP. 
Is this a clock on the computer or projector, a clock on the wall, or a digital clock mounted in the room? 

We do not work on clocks or any clock hardware as that is not a computer or a/v issue. If that is the case then this may be an issue that maintenance can try to assist you with. 


EP: It is an analog clock with hands that hangs on the wall. Should I contact maintenance?

ME: As stated below please note that IT does not work on clocks, and if its an analog clock that takes batteries the clock may be dead. You can reach out to maintenance or if its a cheap plastic clock that someone put up there it may just be time to dispose of it.  

TICKET CLOSED

In case you are wondering this is a ""Technology"" professor and not even the most frustrating encounter with a professor this month. 

My wife is a Professor at the same institution and you better believe she hears about all of these and has advocated for us during faculty Senate meetings.



Additional background

2 months ago the same professor put in a ticket to repair his personal ear buds that he uses for running that he slammed in his car door. 

Last semester I had to leave a meeting as there was an urgent outage impacting the classrooms in an entire building. Upon arrival I found the HDMI cable was not fully seated and with a slight push had it in. He assumed if it was in at all it would work and that it was not working because our entire system is down. 

1 1/2 years ago he submitted a purchase request for software to make his non touch screen laptop work as a touchscreen.  


Yes he is friendly but this is very frustrating.

495,Correctly logging the issue,"A positive one for a change - as there have been a lot of logging failures recently.

One user in the building managed that rarest of things - to be A) someone who genuinely understood computers and only came to us with sensible stuff and, B) a really nice bloke too.  He served as an unofficial liason between IT and his team, a position I've held myself.  Oh, and he was a fellow Sci-Fi geek which really helped him to be a friend.  Thankfully, his team had him logging issues for the whole team just for efficiency.

One day, his report just read (in full, word for word) ""I"".  I should really have phoned but I needed a leg stretch and needing friends is always more fun in person.

Him: ""I know, I know, I'm editing it.  So, you notice this one quickly then, don't you.  Bit faster than your average"".

Me: ""Oh we always see it quickly - it's just we see it's from you and put it to the bottom of the queue.""

We then both had to explain to his senior management (who passed behind we were chatting) that no, this was not an issue between our teams.  To be fair, he was fine with it.",52,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF787D00>

I thought this was odd because the user wasn't remote, they were sitting maybe 20 feet away from their WAP. I decided to hit the gateway and it almost immediately dawned on me what the problem was. This client uses Ubiquiti access points and upon accessing the WAPs web management portal I was greeted with a login page for Netgear. I called the client and asked if they possibly knew why this device was connected to a Netgear WAP. The client told me, ""Yeah, Sally the receptionist brought that in 2 weeks ago because her internet was running slow"" I was stunned, they decided to allow a low level employee to bring their own WAP from home, plug it in, and allow half of the users to connect to it.",59,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF787D60>
497,The nicest stranger getting saved by our Apple DEP.,"I worked for a financial institute. This was right around the holidays a few years ago. 

I get a call from helpdesk(non-IT) at my company saying there is a person (non-employee) on the phone who has a device (iPhone) with our company on it and he's looking for a login. This is the main purpose of Apple DEP. (Incase you don't know what DEP is. Think iCloud activation lock but if the serial is registered to our company the activation unlock part after wiping it goes to our company MDM login. This is regardless of if you have icloud/find my iPhone turned on.). At this point I get the guys information and he was the nicest friendliest guy. I get the serial number. He tells me he bought this off craigslist for $180, I think it was an iPhone 8. He just wanted to use the phone and thought it was a retired phone we use to own. 

At this point I think I am dealing with internal theft. I am thinking IT helpdesk guys are selling company phones on craigslist. I do some digging in our MDM and find the last person the phone was registered too. I also see that this person has a new phone. I go straight to the helpdesk manager and explain. She is now concerned. We bring in the IT helpdesk user who did the swap and registration. We casually ask like nothing is wrong: ""what happen with the user who had the phone swapped?"". He explains that they lost the phone but they think it will turn up so the user was lent a loaner phone until its found. 

At this point we are relieved that there is no internal theft but now worried about that the phone which may or may not have company data on it and is in the hands of a stranger. The stranger is also out $180. We talk to compliance about the issue and we are 90% sure the phone is wiped because it was at the MDM login screen, but not 100%. The phone should of been remotely wiped when first reported but the user who lost it thought it would turn up at his place, car etc. It lost communication with the MDM. Either with the sim card pulled or someone wiped it with a PC/MAC. 

I called back the guy and explain that he bought a lost company phone. I told him we can reimburse him for the money he was out ($180) if he returned the phone to us. We upped it to $200 for his troubles. In compliances mind it was worth $200 for peace of mind. This way he is made whole and we can verify the phone doesn't have company data on it. He returned it and was grateful. We were grateful to him. He gave us the craigslist sellers information but he already reported them and there wasn't much we can do.

This could of gone differently, we could of been assholes and told him to return it and paid nothing or reported him to the police for possession of stolen property. He also could of been fucked out of $180. Our MDM told him who the phone belonged to and saved him.

This story has a pretty nice holiday season ending.",15,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF787DC0>
498,"""So I know they'll remove inactive alumni emails from the system after six months...can I expedite mine?""","So I'm a student worker for my University's ITS Help Desk. I enjoy the job and generally it's smooth sailing with people calling needing help with Password resets and occasionally the faculty needing us to fix some Zoom/high flex stuff. 

Anyways, our university put out a notice to all alumni with emails that if they don't utilize their college-affiliated  emails after six months then they'll be removed from the system. This is generally due to security concerns and also to clear up some room on the servers which have like 300,000+ email accounts on record but only 40% of then actively used. We anticipated a bunch of calls from people either upset or panicking or confused about this, and we have gotten a decent amount of tickets so far, which my supervisor has mostly taken care of.

We got a call from an alumni about the email thing, but to all of our surprises they weren't trying to save it, but delete it faster.

The wild thing is that they told me that they reset their password shortly before calling us, but then decided immediately to 180 and get rid of the account. We told them that as long as the email account is not touched or interacted with in six months, it'll delete automatically so really the caller doesn't have to worry about it.

""I see, but can you expedite deleting it? I don't want to have an old email floating around affiliated with me if I'm not using it.""

I get the callers concerns but we all found it funny because up to the point the notice email was sent out, they didn't care as much about this. Also they literally reset their password which one would normally do if they wanted to get back in!

We did deactivate their account for them and of course the whole thing was friendly and cordial, but when I hung up my coworkers and I had to laugh at the apparent absurdity of it all. It's like accelerating the car as you see the bridge collapsing in the distance. 

Times like these are why I'm never board here!",42,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF787E20>

*I really hold my anger*

> Then why not contacting us?

That's why having a consensus on what software you want to use is important, if a person don't want to support something they'll trash the software/the person that deals with that software, and eventually come to blatant lying about support personnel (although, in this case they were right, tech support didn't do its job, but they're usually lying)",10,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF787E80>

$Me = DanuinKBH, the doofus that answered the phone

$CO = Co-Owner of business.

\*phone rings\*""MSP, this is $Me, how may I help you?""""$Me! Just the person I needed. This is $CO at -business that is 50 miles away-! Our server is gone!""

I think to myself.. ""Gone? WTF did you do this time!?"" This user only runs stuff on the server as admin (Don't Get Me Started! I KNOW. I fought and fought, but MSP-Owner allowed it.)

""OK, $CO, what is it doing? Are there any lights? LEDs? Fans?""

""No! It's just GONE! I need a new server! Today!"" says the frantic person.

""I can dispatch up there for the usual fee and take a look, but if there is a new server needed, we are looking at AT LEAST a 3 week lead, but closer to 8 week. The lockdowns and pandemic have really caused a delay.""

""It won't do any good!  They took the server!"" It's at this point that I sit there and just blink. And try to process what they said.

""'They took it'? Who took it? Did you file a police report?""

$CO proceeds to tell me that it has been seized by the police.

""Well. Did they take the backup devices you have?"" I ask in trepidation...

""No!  I found one from 2 weeks ago!""

""OK, so, at least you have some data. As long as you have your work orders and receipts, you should be able to rebuild your PeachTree/Sage books. But, this is going to get expensive. Just a heads up. We are looking at a LOT of work to COMPLETELY REBUILD YOUR STUFF.""  I am not sugarcoating this. This shit is gonna be expensive for the small business. New server, restore of data (from USB..), build of the server, rebuild of the AD.....

""Just do whatever you can to get us up and running!"" $CO says in frustration.

Anyway, I get a message that a client is hard down. Their Equallogic is reporting as down and their VMs are all fucked. As ""acting door dude"" I have to go out to the cabinet to check it out... but the cabinet documentation is wrong. This client split into two, but the new one was never set up right so now I have to look in all kinds of places.

I can't find this Equallogic anywhere, right? I even found the switch it should have been in, and traced the labelled cable all the way to the end, and found it was just gone. The ethernet cable was just hanging there. It must have been moved during the split and not documented.

I'm telling all of this to the facility engineer, who takes care of the building (HVAC, coolant, power, etc). He goes, ""ha, there was that field tech in today, he was in that cabinet. Would be wild if he just took it.""

We laughed. That would be funny.

...

...he WAS in that cabinet, wasn't he?

...and he left with a server.



I called the head technical supervisor immediately who got field services to bring it back. They're setting it up now and we're trying to figure out how to tell the client we literally just... _took_ their entire storage environment and left with it.


I need a drink.


EDIT: Apparently it was erroneously marked inactive when it obviously was not. Because it was our company's device being used for their paid service/environment, but was marked inactive for that client, the field tech just ripped it out to put it into another internal environment thinking it was all good.

One user called in and told me his ""mouse was stuck"" - the cursor on his monitor was no longer moving. While trying to get more information from him, I kept hearing him grunt with effort followed by a loud THUMP in the background.

After the third such instance during the call, I finally asked what was going on.

""Oh, *oof*, I'm trying to see if I can shake loose the mouse on my screen. *THUD*""

He was picking up his monitor off his desk and dropping it down in an attempt to ""loosen"" it.

They hired another consultant to take a look at the problem and they couldn't figure it out after 5 days.

Just a clueless user from the top floor\*

I always thought that people making 6-7 figures of salary and with corporate card limits higher than my salary would have some sort of sense of the seriousness of protecting your company assets and data... not go several days without reporting a stolen laptop, but alas, my conversation today. For context,  I work as helpdesk for a multi-billion dollar Canadian Retailer who's high-profile users are very much in the public eye and have been targeted before for phishing and data theft.

Cast: Me - Me, CC - Clueless C-Suite user.

\*Que call on the VIP line from an external number without caller ID. Red flag number 1. (Anyone on the VIP line should be coming through from either their extension or corporate cell with their name, already verified with employee number)

&#x200B;

Me: Thanks for calling service desk, my name is Me, can we start with your name please?

CC: I think I'm locked out of my account, unlock me. I have a meeting to join.

Me: We can take a look, I'll need your name first though.

CC: It's Clueless C-Suite user.

Me: lets check why you can't get in, one moment.

\*Their account has been blocked by network security team, after dozens of failed logon attempts to the network.\*

Me: Alright, your account was disabled by the security team, I'll need to confirm some information before we do anything with this. You'll need to verify your Employee number, the person you report to and the address of the building that you work out of.

CC: My employee ID is  \*incorrect number\*, I work from ""head office"" and I don't report to anyone I'm the \*high profile c-suite position.\*

Me: Alright so you do have a listed manager even if you don't communicate with them every day. Please confirm their name. Also the employee number you provided is incorrect.

CC: Why am I locked out this is costing the company millions of dollars! (it's probably not but ok)

Me: There's been suspicious activity on your account. Have you clicked any emails asking for your password in the last few weeks or let anyone access your hardware? Even if it was locked or powered off?

CC: I don't click emails, you make me do enough training on that.

Me: Ok how about if anyone has had access to your laptop or corporate cellphone. Even just for a few minutes.

CC: Well it was stolen from my car... I'm not sure where it is now.

Me: ....I'm sorry, your laptop was stolen? When did this happen? Last night? We'll need a police report immediately.

CC: No it was a few days ago. My bag with my corporate cell and laptop was taken from my car when I was parked at local mall. I asked my assistant to order me a replacement  but I haven't received it.

Me: These sorts of things need to be reported to us or security immediately. Whoever stole your devices would have unrestricted access to any incoming phone calls and could get into your laptop without much difficulty. I'm going to begin the process to wipe those devices and alert the security team. Please provide as much information as to the time and location of the theft, where was your car parked at the mall, etc.

CC: This is why I didn't report this in the first place. You make such a big deal of this for no reason. Just get me back into my accounts so I can join my meeting.

Me: Unfortunately that can't be done until the network team can perform a risk assessment on your account and get the proper monitoring configured. What sort of information do you keep on your laptop and phone, is there anything confidential or that could harm the company if released to the public?

CC: I'm working on an acquisition of a competitor with the legal team, there's probably some documents regarding that that shouldn't get out. When do I get my new computer?

Me: The new devices aren't the issue here, I've paged out the network security team. Once they complete the assessment and receive confirmation that the devices have been wiped, they'll call you and provide you new credentials for your account. I suggest that you reach out to HR so they can forward your employment letter so that you can correctly verify your information.

CC: So you can't tell me the information I'll need?

Me: It'll likely be a combination of your employee number which is on your benefits card, as well as your manager listed on teams and your office address.

CC: What's my employee number?

Me: You're not verified so I cannot provide that.

CC: So you're not going to help me at all?

Me: My job is to help protect the company systems and assets, lost devices are serious and the process is strict. If I unlock your account or give you the info you need to verify I'll be fired immediately.

CC hangs up on me, I go about my morning but keep an eye on this ticket because I'm nosey.

505,You Don't Need To Know,"Some background: I spent some years on IBM mainframes as the BOFH before progressing to the next logical step of automating all those menial, boring tasks and spending more quality time watching funny pictures of cats.


A long time ago, years before the internet became popular, I was approached by a Network Support Guy (NSG) asking for my help on a project. Now, the organisation I worked for was super secretive, so everything was on a ""need-to-know"" basis. In this case, the Project Manager (PM) was the only person who needed to know the end-to-end setup. This is important for later.


There were about 25 offices up and down the UK, with local PCs running our propriety software. This software had to be updated regularly, so the plan was to write and test the update at HQ, then electronically deliver the new software to the offices. The developers would upload the software to the mainframe then issue a message including the new filename. My task was to intercept this message, capture the filename, pull a batch job into the scheduler and edit it with the filename. Repeat for each office. Each job would create a process in our network data mover (NDM) to send the file to that office.


So Network Support Guy set up the SNA links to the 25 offices, Batch Support Guy set up the jobs and I rattled off a few scripts, then we got permission for the live test. Unusually for me, this worked a treat and every transmission was a success. Job done, right?


PM: Not quite. See, the location where the software runs is different from the location where we deliver it.  


NSG: Ok, so we write a step into the NDM process to copy the file from the network directory to the working directory.  


PM: Er, no, they're on different PCs.  


NSG: Oh, I see...ok, we write a step to issue an alert on the network PC, then the user can copy the file to a floppy disk and use that to update the other PCs.  


PM: That won't work either. The staff kept putting their own games on the network PC, or changing the password then going on holiday, so it's now kept in a locked room.  


NSG: So how do you plan to let them know the new software update has arrived?  


Developer: We could send them a fax (I told you this was a *long* time ago).  


PM: Nope, a fax can sit unread for days or get tossed out. What we'll do is send them a letter by recorded delivery; they can't ignore that.  


Me [sticks hand up]: Here's a mad idea, shoot it down if it's too crazy. Why not stick the disk with the software update in the same envelope as the letter?


Project abandoned.   


TL;DR spent weeks developing an electronic software delivery plan when snail mail was right there.

507,Sometimes It Works (Never),"Been awhile since I've shared a story here but this just happened and I've got the time so....

I receive a text from a gentleman (to be known as Cus) who tells me the following:

Me:  What's the issue with the machine?

**Cus:**  It has recently stopped turning on.  It sometimes turns on *without the ram sticks* but other times not.

**Me:**  Ok, sure, bring it on by.

Cus arrives and sets his new build on my table.  I pull the side panels off and start looking it over---checking all the cables, making sure everything is seated properly, while plugging in my keyboard, display and power cable.  I'm in the middle of saying ""Well everything looks to be assembled correctly,"" when I see them.

You know those big, tapered hard drive screws used to mount 3.5"" hard drives into hard drive trays?  Cus has used those to mount his motherboard to the case.  I remark that he has used the wrong screws, and look closer as the corner of his motherboard appears to literally be bending and touching the case.

It is.  *All the corners are*.  There are no standoffs underneath this motherboard *except* for the center notched standoff that doesn't require a screw.

I stop and unplug everything and tell him I can't turn it on as it is, and that the board has to be removed and either remounted properly or breadboard it to test it and make sure it's not toast.

**Cus:**  It didn't come with standoffs.

**Me:**  Typically the standoffs are already installed, and extras come in a little cardboard box tucked in the hard drive caddy of the new case.

**Cus:**  There weren't any.  I would've noticed.

**Me:**  Well, I'm happy to go further and test it out and do the work, mount it properly if everything is working properly and hasn't been shorted out.

**Cus:**  Nah, I should be able to do this.  It's just some standoffs.

Right now I'm thinking *yes, you should be able to do this, but you didn't do it the first time, and not only that....you've insisted there are no standoff screws available, they didn't come preinstalled and that there were none in the case so....how are you going to achieve this!?*

**Me:**  Is this your first build?

**Cus:**  It's my first build.....recently......in about 20 years.

**Me:**  Ok, well, good luck!



As a side note---I see this A LOT.  Typically not this bad, but it's always a variation of this.  What I usually end up seeing are the wrong screws used to mount the mobo that over time vibrate loose and dance across the motherboard shorting things out along the way.

C: ""Entering power sleep mode"" and i can't get it to show anything else

\*Ya, so the CPU being stolen, I have no idea what that means, this ""HDD"" Error just means the computer isn't getting a video signal...so I document what actually is going on and get back to the call\*

C: Okay so from the sounds of the error on the screen it may be that the cable is loose or bad, could you please check the cables for me?

C: pfft, no the cpu was stolen and I already checked the cables

SF: Could you try turning the computer on for me to check to see if any lights pop up?

C: No I'm telling you...

There's a bit of a scuffle and some random worker comes on

R: The CPU was stolen and we need a tech up here to fix it

\*I try to do the same troubleshooting steps to maybe hopefully get a lock that it is an issue with a cable or it's not plugged in but...\*

I was riding the helpdesk and an email came in from a site about 30 minutes away, strange beeping coming from the comms closet (actually a stack of network hardware and a UPS underneath a staircase). They included a picture.

So beeping means UPS issues. I looked at the picture and did a little zoom and enhance (okay just zoom) on the UPS display. 47 minutes remaining on battery and the picture was taken 15 minutes ago.

I'm in my car within minutes, calling the boss and telling him I'm going to go prevent a site outage. Got there with maybe 8 minutes to spare by driving like I usually do, which I do not recommend.

Plug a lamp into the same outlet as the UPS, no current. Nor does any nearby outlet provide current. I had to run a 50' extension cord (yes, I know that's not good) to the UPS to get it powered back up. Checked the breakers, they were all on. The circuit was just dead.

Let the UPS charge up a bit and found a shorter run to an outlet everyone forgot existed, had the site manager call an electrician and managed to get things working with zero downtime.

Reports: there are thousands generated every hour, every day, every week. Client reports, status reports, daily reports, weekly reports, quarterly reports, etc. We have many systems that generate the reports, and many ways we can generate them: it can be a simple scheduled data source which spits out into a CSV the contents of a SQL query; it can be an actual report that was designed with a template and on regular basis gets the figures updated with the latest data; it can be a web panel export in Excel that is emailed to whoever the user wants because they can set those up themselves. Then there are Excel spreadsheets every team uses that can pull data via a SQL connection or a third party add-in. Also, we have email notifications in HTML forms that have nice tables and graphics in them.

I call them what they are: scheduled data sources, panel exports, spreadsheets, etc. so I can keep track of which system generates them and how. For the users, however, they're just ""reports"".

So yesterday, a user reaches out via Teams:

$user: Hey, I need help with the $GenericName report.

$me: What $GenericName report? Can you be a bit more specific?

$user: the [Department X] $GenericName report.

$me: I'm going to need more than that. Is this a report generated by $SystemA or by $SystemB? Is it an Excel file or a PDF? Do you get it via email or do you consult it via $WebPortal?

$user: it's the afternoon $GenericName report that is sent to [Department Y].

$me:...... I still don't know what you're talking about.

$user sends me a path on one of the shared drives where analysts save all their documents.

$user: it's this $GenericName report.

$me: (finally getting somewhere) Ah! I see... Yeah, this isn't a report any of our systems generate. This is manually created by analysts, you need to ask whoever owns this to help you.

$user: Ok, thanks.

Sometimes I wonder how small people think our company is. Or maybe users think the world revolves around them and fail to realize there are other departments that deal with other shit, and I cannot know every single aspect of everyone's roles.",142,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF85A280>
512,Customer support 24x7 you say?,"Back in the late 90’s I worked for a freight forwarder setting up a new office in England. I handled their cargo tracking system data, and customer support. The system used an Access Database and dialup modem to retrieve data from a Valued-Added Network provider. It was so badly written that the Database would constantly break while downloading updates and have to be repaired on my local machine. This entailed downloading the entire DB file, repairing it and uploading it again to the customer’s cargo tracking PC.

I had some fantastic training, including a 10 day trip to the US. Unfortunately, while I was there, a major customer (think global sports apparel brand) had a major data issue, that I ‘had’ to correct (according to my boss). I could not connect to their database from the freight forwarder’s office as they had a new digital telephone network, so I had to do it via the Hotel’s analog telephone. It was urgent, and I had to do it over the weekend from Seattle. Downloading, repairing and reuploading the Database took from Friday evening to Sunday evening, allowing them to only lose Friday afternoon in the UK. I thought this was great customer service on my part, despite the challenges.

It was painfully slow as at that time I was using the latest 48k baud modem. And I was literally connected for 35-40 hours! My boss chewed me out when I put in my travel expenses and the Hotel telephone bill was £4000……… He was just a Sales Manager so completely clueless on any of my processes and what I had to do to support his customers. I thought I’d saved the day, and he was angry!

He was even more angry when I quit some months later to become an IT Manager. Such is life 🙂",10,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF85A2E0>
513,sometimes it only takes one question,"Another story from my university sysadmin days.   

Our cast of characters:

Me:  department level sysadmin with many unhappy professors

A:  my coworker who had all the same problems I had

Dean J:  Dean of the College that my department and A's department were in

B:  Interim CIO for the University

G: Director of Networking for the University

I worked at a university back in the early 2000s as a sysadmin for a computer intensive research department.  Most of the users on campus were supported by a separate IT organization that had fairly severe budget and expertise problems.   Some of the folks were great, some were not.  

These folks were having real issues keeping us connected to the outside world.  Bandwidth was low, security was bad, infrastructure was poor, all around not a good situation.  ""A"" was a sysadmin in a similar department who had all the same headaches as me, mainly professors continually complaining about poor connectivity, things like they couldn't reach outside sources reliably from their offices, and could not reach their department research systems from home.   These folks tended to work any and all hours so this was very important.

Anyway, I spent a fair amount of time opening tickets with the IT guys on network issues, as did A.  It was super frustrating since it was clear that the IT guys were caught in an endless loop of fire fighting and basically never got ahead.   Finally A got so fed up he asked his Head of Department for permission to ask our Dean to ask for a meeting with IT management.  He asked if I wanted to join in and I didn't even ask my boss for permission, I just said, ""you bet!"".

So  A and I go to the Dean's main assistant, a lady we had worked with a long time and was a whiz at getting things done.  She got Dean J on board, he was getting all the gripes from professors just like we were, and we got the meeting scheduled.

The big day arrived and we all sit down in Dean J's conference room.   Dean J is at the head of the table, B and G are on one side and A and I are on the other.  B and G start off admitting to all the problems, telling us how they inherited things from previous managers (not quite true since both of them are old timers in IT management).   And finally they start to lay out all their plans for future.

There's a plan to replace outdated network equipment (it was scary, some building were operating on 10M shared environments).   They were going to spin up a NOC, implement collecting network metrics (something A and I were already doing for our shops).  Implement improved IDS systems, all music to everyone's ears.  

But there's a problem.  A and I having been hearing this for YEARS.  And nothing ever happens.  Or its tried and makes things worse.   A and I are exchanging glances knowing that these guys are just telling us what they know we want to hear.  There are no actual milestones quoted, its all pie-in-the-sky BS.  

I'm worried that Dean J is going to buy this load of manure but no, he's not a Dean for nothing.   Dean J has been sitting listening politely, asking very few questions, with a small notepad in front of him, and he's been twirling a pencil around, not actually writing anything down.

B and G are really talking up the NOC, its going to solve so many problems once its up and running, Dean J positions his pencil over the notepad and asks, ""And when will the NOC be operational?""

B and G start squirming in their seats.  ""Well, you know, hard to say, depends on this or that"".  And we get a bunch of double talk about how they can't really say when, ""security is hard"".   A and I are about leaping out of our seats watching these guys twist and turn.   Dean J is just sitting, still holding his pencil, waiting for them to give him some hard dates.   B and G are exchanging looks, some mumbled ""what do you think?"" back and forth, floundering like a fish on a dock.  

Finally they come up with ""Spring Semester"".  

I can't resist and innocently ask, ""of what year?"".",14,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF85A340>
514,Users NEVER forget their passwords.,"This is about a ticket I got at 9am this morning.

I work for a healthcare provider, and we use a number of government websites. A manager puts in a ticket saying they're unable to log in to a website and are adamant the firewall is blocking them.

I log on to the user's computer, they get to the login, screen and it throws up an incorrect password error. The user tries multiple times until they lock themselves out of the account. I walked them through how to unlock the account through the website, and then hit ""forgot password"".

The website says the user cannot change their password because it was just changed within the last 24 hrs.

Me: ""Oh, did you change your password within the last 24 hours for this site?""

User: ""No, I changed it yesterday""

Me: "".....Okay, let me clear your saved password for the website and see if we can log in""

I go through the browser's settings and clear the saved password, the user then tries to log in, saving the password back to chrome and gets the same ""incorrect password"" error.

Me: ""well we can't reset the password until tomorrow, so you'll have to wait until tomorrow to log in""

User: ""I know I'm typing the password correctly, I just set it yesterday.  I called the support line and they said it has to be our firewall or the browser that's blocking it""

I then connect the user's computer to a public wifi that's not connected to our firewall, and have them try it again, and same ""incorrect password"" error.

User: ""Well they (the site's support) closed the ticket on me because they said it has to be our firewall""

Me:  ""Well I just tried it on a completely different network, and we got the same error, so.....""

User: ""I'M JUST GOING TO LOG IN ON MY PERSONAL COMPUTER FROM HOME""

Me: ""Okay, please let me know if you're able to log in so I can update the ticket, have a great day""",11,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF85A3A0>

516,Choosing beggar client blows up my phone 3.5 hours after the store is closed!,"I run a small repair shop in the middle of nowhere. I had a client wait until 8:30PM last night to text me... 3.5 hours after store hours. It ended up in a stupid argument because she doesn't like the answer I gave her and wants free work or free phone tech support and I said no and finally blocked her number.

For even more context this computer came in unable to boot. Hard drive was dead. She donated the PC to me so she wouldn't have to pay the 50 dollar bench fee since she said 150 was too much for a new SSD + Windows 10 install (which was me cutting her a 50 dollar break since I usually charge 200 for that)

So I kept it for about a week before she called me 4x asking for free tech support on how to get a new PC before finally wanting the donated one back which I gave back to her when she paid the $150.

Then last night she blew up my phone again... at 8:30 PM...

This is how the argument went.

Her: Why is this email on my login screen?

Me: Because windows 10 requires an email.

Her: Well what if I wanna sell it? How do I get it off?

Me: You don't. You have to reset it.

Her: How do I do that?

Me: You figure it out or give me $100 and i'll do it for you.

Her: Well... my printer doesn't work. It used to work before you had it. (classic line; always the printer doesn't work and you need to fix it for free!)

Me: How old is the printer?

Her: 2007 (a lie)

Me: Send me a picture of the error

Her: \*error says the printer isn't compatible, it's too old, supported up until Windows 7\*

Me: Explains the error and gives her some fast solutions out of kindness. Same error message with 3 different approaches. Tell her to buy a new printer.

Her: Well it used to work.

Me: It would cost more for me to drive to your house to fix it. It's $150 for a house call for that and more if you need more stuff done.

Her: Well I don't have a lot of money.

Me: The price is the same for everyone.

Her: Well how do I get my email off the login thing? Can I call you?

Me: It's 930PM... I don't do over the phone tech support. You can have me fix it in shop for 100, on site for 150, those are your options. Thanks.

Her: Keeps saying the same shit.

Me: I am sorry you are having this difficulty but those are your options.

Her: Well you said it would be just like I had it before (gaslighting, a lie)

Me: I told you it would be as if you took it out of the package from the manufacturer.. (same thing I tell everyone)

Her: \*more whining about the same issue at the top of this page expecting a diff answer\*

Me: \*blocks her number\*

I told this woman the previous day the shop closes at 5PM... we don't do phone support. She's already hassled me more than once trying to get out of paying her previous bills with sob stories and bullshit.",63,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF85A460>
517,Descriptions Are Everything,"I work for a Service Desk at a very large auto insurance company (my first official role working in IT). We work with thousands of internal employees everyday and like everyone else our workload increase has been  exponential during the pandemic. I enjoy the work for the most part but have had my share of headaches working in the role taking phone calls. Recently I got promoted to work in our help portal website queue where employees can provide their own help tickets for assistance with the understanding that the issues aren’t urgent and will be answered in about 24-48 hours. I like not being on the phone all day anymore but I’ve received some of the most absurd ticket descriptions while working in this role. The web form is a small text box to provide a brief summary of the problem encountered. 

Yesterday we had an outage with one of our internal systems that was reported to all employees in the company. We still got a few tickets requesting help which is expected, but one ticket in particular I could not help but laugh about. Someone submitted a description where they decided to open the source code for the website that was down and decided to copy and paste all 400 lines of error code into the description. In the next ticket, someone wrote 1 single word about their problem: “website”. Needless to say, these 2 employees were the last on my list of priorities since they don’t follow basic instructions.",26,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF85A4C0>
518,"Doctor had me fired, my company imploded","Back in the Dark Ages, around 1993, I worked for a medical transcription firm as their SysAdmin.  We were doing some cutting edge IT stuff, in getting transcriptions printed at the hospitals remotely, using print queues with the modem number hardcoded in and the system would look for queues with anything in them and dial the number if it found something in that queue.  It worked really well, until it didn't.  

I was the only SysAdmin in this city, so I was on call 24/7/365 and was averaging 3 hours of sleep per night, when I could go home and trying to catch little catnaps here and there when I could.  Anytime something would go wrong on the hospital side I would have to go to the hospital and fix it.  A few months after I started the two of the VP's from Corp relocated to my city, since we were the most productive city with the highest profits.  The first thing they did was come up with an excuse to fire the current director, then they took over operations themselves.  

Then my job went from taking care of our systems to taking care of the doctor's computers too.  I did what I could, but I was also sending out resumes.  Then I was told to go to a hospital and see why the printing stopped.  I remember this day, I hadn't been home for two days and had been going nonstop for 18 hours.  I get there, someone had unplugged the modem.  I plug it back in, call comes in and jobs start printing.  This doctor walks over and tells me that VP#1 told him that I would go out to his house and work on his home computer.  I politely explain to the doctor that I can't do that, and that I'm heading home to get some sleep.  Then I head back to the office to pickup a few things before heading home.    


As soon as I walk through the door I get escorted straight to the VP's Office, both VP#1, VP#2 and the Office Manager are there.  They proceed to start chewing me out.  I just started laughing at them.  I'm the only person in a 1000 miles that knows anything about this system.  They lose their temper and tell me I'm fired and am to leave immediately.  I really said ""Thank You.""  Then left.

This was December 15th, my oldest son's birthday.  On the way home I stop a Mom & Pop computer store where I know some of the people to drop off a resume.  They tell me that they have no openings right now but will call me when they do.  I talk to a couple friends while I'm there then head on home.  The only thing I'm worried about is telling my gf that I got fired.  I walk through the door, she's at work.  I see the answering machine blinking so I hit play.  Mom & Pop Computer Store, our primary Novell Engineer just quit are you still available.  I call them back and let them know I'll be there tomorrow.    


That began a much more peaceful career, with better pay, rotating on-call and most every weekend and holiday off.

519,You made it worse!,"Many years ago, one of my first jobs in this company was to find a technical solution to a situation where technology was used wrong. A customer had a business, that had a production control and billing software run locally and as a part of wanting to exist on the internet they bought a booking service from an outside vendor. At first things were good, the orders made throught the portal came in as e-mails and they'd have someone enter them into their locally run system.

But then more and more people moved onto ordering from the internet and all the sudden entering all that data turned into a never ending chore. The company owner approached us for a solution. 

We talked to both software vendors and I create a simple system, that fetched a comma separated text file with info on the new orders and used the production control software's API to push it in there. Magic happened: people ordered, the orders went directly into the system. Everyone was happy, the end!

Wait! There's more! The system worked without a single hickup all these years, until not long ago the customer sold his business and in comes the new owner and his friend slash IT genius. Just talking 5 minutes to this IT guy made me fear for the worst and boy, did we get it.

The IT guy starts drilling into what the customer has. He likes nothing of it. One thing he specially dislikes is the order portal, which he fires and makes a contract with their, worse IMO, direct competitor. He also asks for the technical details on how the system used to work and hears it uses CSV files. He makes a tirade about it being an outdated format and that something more modern needs to be used. Me and my boss both tell him no one ever sees those CSV files, they're processed automatically. No change.

So the IT guy goes behind our backs and requests the new portal to send the orders daily as .xlsx files. He also dumps the middleware we made and requests a software that saves the incoming Excel files onto a network share. Since we're talking to a wall, what's requested is made. 

Now the employees get an Excel sheet with a lot of eye candy and the IT guy sells this to the new owner as a huge modernization. Then comes the day when it's actually switched to use over the old one and guess what! All the employees hate it, they have to type in the data manually into the production control software and a lot of the less tech-savvy employees struggle with finding the files from the network share. The friction this causes in the work force finally reaches the new owner, who contacts my employer and tells we made their systems worse, fix it!",30,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF85A580>
520,Truncate the table in the right place,"All developers were on the rota to work on the support desk for the software house I worked at many years ago. This one story springs to mind.
 
A developer had a problem he couldn’t reproduce on our system, and we needed to get a copy of a couple of their tables back on to our system to see if it was something environmental with the system or their data. So, the procedure was basically, truncate table locally, log on to client machine via VPN and a puTTY-esque client to both our local server and the client’s machine and run a utility to pull the table contents. Except this one time, the developer forgot to truncate the table 1st so ended up with the union of our test data and the client’s data. So they truncated the table and pulled the data - except they’d switched sessions to the client window so truncated this table on their live server. Daft thing was, he mis-typed the command in 2 times before he got it “right”.
 
Thankfully because he’d pulled the data locally, we were able to delete our test data from it and pull the data back in the reverse direction to recover it on the clients server.
 
Soon after this, they put a policy in place where any support work should be done on a COPY of the live data whilst investigating any issues.

521,"Sorry, but that's not allowed. Or how a manager can be a complete jerk.","Normally I try to post the more funny and outlandish encounters and situations from my job. This one isn't that funny. But a part of me really needs to vent this one.

For those who don't yet know. I am an application admin for an elder care facility. I managed the electronic patient dossier system including account management and the like.

&#x200B;

This morning I got a call from M. M is the manager for some of the supporting staff, mainly housekeeping and the event organizers. Middle management, she is normally not allowed access to the dossiers since she doesn't actually provide care. And the rule of thumb is 'No care no access'.

M starts about how there's been an incident at one of our sites, one of our clients has theatened one of the staff. The police are involved  and she'd like to have access to the medical dossier of this cliënt.

This is what happened afterwards:

Me: ""I'm not sure I can grant you access since you don't actually provide care for this client. Plus the way our system is built would mean that I'll wind up giving you access to the files of other clients as well. I'll talk to my team lead and ask him what he thinks. Can you log a ticket in the mean time?

M: ""Sure but it's really urgent. The threat was very serious and there's information in that file that will help with the eviction.""

We break off the connection and while she logs the ticket (yes she did do that) I open a chat with my team lead and with someone from control to talk about granting acces, wether we should and what alternatives we can offer.

Both control and TL are not eager to grant the requested access. TL tells me to keep to the basic principles for access (which tell me not to grant her request) Control suggest that M should talk to the cliënt's caregiver and ask for the individual relevant reports from them. Which is actually a really sensible idea. Armed with this new information and considering the urgency I decide to not react to the ticket, but immediately call M back.

me: ""Hi M. I've talked about your request with control and my TL. And I don't think I can grant your request. The information in a clients medical file is privileged and should only be accessed by the people who are involved with providing care for the client. Control had a good suggestion to contact the clients primary caregiver and ask for the relevant reports from her.""

M: ""I think that's very strange. My subordinates the event organizers have access to those files. So why can't I have access?""

Me: ""Your subordinates have access because they're required to report on the clients behaviour during activities that they oversee. But you don't organize or oversee events like that.""

M: ""So I have to call the primary caregiver on her day off to get her to make a printout of those documents?""

Me: ""No there's other people in her team. You can call one of the head nurses as well if you don't want to bother the primarycaregiver on her day off.""

M: ""I still think I should have access! Now I have to get all this stuff printed out. That's not safe either!""

Me: ""No, the nurse or caregivers can send you the information through $securesystem that's in place for things like this.""

M: ""This is crazy. I am the manager for these people and they do have access to the files! Why won't you give me access?!""

Me: ""I'm not allowed to give you access. Even if you're their manager. I'm sorry but I strongly believe it goes against the privacy regulations of our client to give you access. You don't need to see their medical information. It's my job to be the gatekeeper here and I can't give you access.""

At this point I'm pretty exhasparated. I cut some bits out but we'd been going in circles for a while already.

M: ""Well fine! I'll go ask someone for access. But that means the police will not be able to do anything!""

Upon which she hangs up on me.

I'm really frustrated, especially by that last sentence. It feels a lot like she is trying to blackmail and/or blame me for any undesired outcome in the case. I called my TM after she hung up on me and he has my back.

After I've calmed down a little more I'm going to follow the CYA protocol and document the shit out of this. I'm also considering mentioning this to HR.",72,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF85A640>
522,That's Not A Docking Station,"I work at an MSP and early on in the pandemic most of our clients were still working to transition to remote work, so there was a lot of calls regarding setting up docking stations, external monitors, etc.

One particular call came from a very nice, but notoriously clueless user, ""Abby"". Abby had been promised a new docking station from the CCO and was calling to get that set up.

Abby: ""Hi, I got this new dock from the office today but I don't see where my laptop is supposed to plug into it?""

Me: ""Okay, well there should be either a TB or USB-C cable on the dock that you should he able to plug in, do you see that?""

Abby: ""No, it just looks like there's a bunch of ports on the back, which one of these am I supposed to plug into?""

At this point I know something's definitely not right.

Me: ""Abby, Can you tell me what the model number on the dock is? I need to look up what exactly you have.""

Abby: ""The thing on the front says Optiplex 3080.""

...what the fuck?

Me: ""Abby, how exactly did you get this 'dock' again?""

Abby: ""CCO had it on a desk outside his office, he told me to grab it on my way out.""

At this point I had to start muting myself because I was laughing so much. She'd stolen an entire desktop thinking it was a docking station!

We ended up calling the CCO and explaining to him what happened, whose only reaction was to loudly shout ""OH MY GOD"". He'd left the dock on the same desk as the PC and (incorrectly) assumed she'd be able to tell the difference.

Abby has had her fair share of goofs before and after too, but that was definitely the most amusing one. She's always at least pleasant to talk to, but as I said, definitely clueless.",41,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF85A6A0>
523,When sleazy salesmen and cloud apps collide,"Cast your eyes back a few (or more) years back to the time that cloud apps were the shiny new hotness. If you didn't have them, your company was a relic of the stone age, and could no longer sit at the cool kids table... 

Lol, some people actually believed that dribble including our Chief Sales Officer (CSO). He'd seen an advert on the back of an in-flight magazine for this cloud app and instantly knew this was our ticket into the new age of business, exploding sales, stonks memes, and fat bonuses.

And so he did what any reasonable person would do... Have a chat with the Head of IT (me) about this awesome new application. Lol, wishful thinking. But he did organise a demo of the software with the C-suite and senior management team. At least that's something, right?

Some time later, we trundle into a conference room with our sleazy sales guy, and our cloud app's sleazy sales guy for this demo. 

Through the demo, the Ops Manager leans over and whispers *""This looks like MS Excel""*.. I nodded, not wishing to miss the good stuff.

After the demo, nobody is especially impressed, except for our CSO. We just saw a half-developed online spreadsheet with some fancy graphics. But we're not finished yet, it's the CSO's turn to sell it, and we spend the next half hour being entertained by all the business applications he's got lined up for it. It's going to create a collaborative workforce, it's going to foster information sharing, it's going to enforce single-source-of-truth, it's going to streamline business processes, it's going to be available any-time and any-where, their support team can remotely help, and it's going to replace MS Excel.

That's when the mic dropped. 

See, none of the department heads really cared until it impacted them directly. They all use Excel extensively, and what they heard was we were going to take it away and replace it with something shittier. *""Can we import our Excel files?"" ""Can we link sheets?"" ""Can we filter xyz"", ""Can we, can we, can we""* and so on.. And the answer was nearly always *""No, but that feature is on our roadmap*"".

Until this point, I had been quiet.. I'm a grizzled old IT manager.. I've been through this, and seen how it plays out, and it was my turn to put the final nail in the coffin: 

*""So if this is cloud based, where is it hosted?""* *""Singapore""*, the cloud sales guy replied.

*""CSO, you do realise that a majority of the data you're proposing to host is controlled under license that doesn't allow for 3rd party access, and especially exporting from our country?""* It's a rhetorical question of course, the discussion is over, and I'm closing my notebook and getting ready to leave. I've wasted enough time on this.

CEO starts to thank everybody for their time, we're not going to buy the software.

&#x200B;

*""We've already bought the software, this is the project kick-off meeting""*

\*Mic drop\*

&#x200B;

To be fair, my stunned goldfish expression is simply because the grizzled IT manager who's seen it all, has in fact, not seen it all.

&#x200B;

Cutting to the chase, our company of 200 factory workers and 70 engineers / office workers / etc now had a subscription to 500 seats of this spreadsheet software. Why 500? That's the minimum commitment.. Apparently.. The annual cost of this license was about the same as buying Office Pro for every employee, 3 times over. Every year. And because it was a ""professional service"", not ""software"", the purchase wasn't flagged for IT review. 

Where did this money come from though? It was reallocated from a HR software project that we were going to commence in a few months time, a headcount reduction (because ""improved efficiency""), with the remaining supposed to come from cancelling various MS software maintenance contracts that we obviously didn't need anymore (hint: Office was a perpetual license without any SA). 

I'm still goldfishing, Finance manager is having a heart attack, HR manager is having conniptions, and the CEO is looking like an axe murderer.

But, as it turns out, we had the software. None of the managers wanted anything to do with it.. They were still very attached to Excel and weren't going to volunteer to give it up. It was the HR manager who was voluntold - after all, her software project was now off the cards. But never fear, our cloud spreadsheet friend has personally guaranteed that his software will do the job..

All we needed to do was engage his recommended 3rd party delivery consultant and they would spec up and quote for the design and implementation work.

And that was our 3rd drop of the afternoon. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

So how did this all pan out?

* Firstly the CSO didn't get fired, but his name was mud for a few months. He did get fired later for something more egregious though.
* The headcount reduction came from the CSO's open positions, but after complaining bitterly, that burden was transferred to Ops and the CSO went on a hiring spree.
* The consulting bill came in at about 5 times the original budget we had for the HR software project. It didn't work, and they went back to using MS Excel.
* Despite the Finance manager's best effort, they couldn't fully reconcile (cover-up) the financials and process ""loopholes"" and ended up getting a stink-eye on their yearly audit
* The budget cuts were eventually eaten by IT of course.. I did cancel the sales team's laptop refresh planned that year. I also made sure that the laptops I refreshed that year for other people were awesome. I'm pleased to report that it caused a whole bunch of jealousy drama. Petty and vindictive, I know
* The subscription contract was for 2 years, and despite our commercial manager's best effort, we paid a second year. uugh.

524,Why do some IT guys go bald.,"Just a couple stories to help my fellow trench workers smile today.

Story One:

This morning the bosses wife couldn't log into the system.  Her password kept locking her out.  After resetting the lockout and password several times I was ordered to make the drive and see why she couldn't get in.  

First things first I tell her not to keep trying until I get there (15 minutes out).  She does and locks her account again.  Once again I unlock her account then stand behind her telling her to try again.  After watching her I reach over turn on NUMLOCK.  Works the second time.

&#x200B;

Story Two:

This case was ongoing.  It literally has taken me weeks to figure it out.  Accountant's computer shuts off then restarts while working.  I check and see no reason it is being shut down.  Swap out her workstation after running several tests and it is fine for a week.  Then it happens to the new workstation.

Thinking it must be environment I test the outlet and replace the power strip (outlets for computers are on battery backup).  System seems to be fine for a few days then it happens again.  This time I ran a cord to another outlet with a battery backup just to see if the outlet was acting up.

It wasn't until multiple fails I figured out the problem.  During wet cold weather the accountant wore boots to work.  Once at her desk she would take off her boots.  Occasionally she would run her toes over the power strip pressing the reset button.",109,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF85A760>
525,Woe is me and the SSD,">User: ""My computer doesn't work!""

I'm startled away from my morning ritual of coffee and ~~TFTS~~ productive research by a user propping open my door.

>ME: ""OK, what error messages does it give you?""

>User: ""It's black screen with loads of writing on it!""

*Ooooook, helpful...*

So i pop down to the user's office and investigate the issue first-hand.

>No bootable medium found. Press F1 to reboot

*Feck.*

I unplug the monitor and cabling, and haul this poor old laptop back to the office to reseat the M.2 drive.

I pull it open, clean ou the cat hair, and take the M.2 drive out. I rub the contacts with our fibreglass pen, and wet the contacts with some isopropyl, and insert/remove it a few times from the M.2 socket. It feels a bit loose, weird... I slap the back panel back on it, just to stop unwanted shorts, and power it back on.

>No bootable medium found. Press F1 to reboot

*Double Feck*

Oh well, time to file a ticket with Smell customer support!

*A few hours later...*

An email arrives from Smell Tech Support. Oh goody, a bunch of troubleshooting steps i've already done.... I start composing the slightly agitated email...

>Smell: Were you able to check if the drive is detected in BIOS or not?

>Me: Yes, not detected in BIOS

>Smell: Have you tried running the Diagnostics to check for error codes or if the drive is not detected during the test?

>Me: Not detected in diagnostics either...

>Smell: Is there a known good drive that you can try to see if that works with your system or another system where you can test the original drive to see if it would be detected there?

Wait, hang on, i haven't tried that. There's another one waiting for service in the office, i better just try it and see if we can isolate the fault to the SSD or the motherboard...

So i crack open the other one, swap over the known good SSD into the faulty machine, pop the back back on and power up

>No bootable medium found. Press F1 to reboot

Cool, it's the motherboard. Probably explains why the SSD feels kind of loose. Lets just try the SSD from the faulty machine in the good machine

>No bootable medium found. Press F1 to reboot

Huh, must have fried the SSD too. Weird that this one also feels kind of loose though... Lets pop the SSD's back into their respective machines...

>No bootable medium found. Press F1 to reboot

>No bootable medium found. Press F1 to reboot

*Triple feck. Have i just killed another machine?*

I take the SSD back out of the good machine, wipe it and reseat it. Wait, that's not in the M.2 slot, that's kind of jammed under the mainboard....

No... it can't be... Surely it's not that simple... I crack open the faulty machine and verify my theory.

Yup, i'm an idiot. I reseat the M.2 drive *into the M.2 slot*, instead of jammed higgledy piggledy under the motherboard, pop the back panels back on both the machines, and take them for a test toast.

They both boot without issue.",96,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF85A7C0>
526,Now she knows what it's like,"I work on an IT service desk and my partner works in a food shop

She was off yesterday and kept getting called by her manager, she answered on the 3rd time and her manager asked how do I use this CCTV? Baring in mind this is a system the she could use multiple time a day and she's worked in that shop for a good few years now so she should know exactly how to use it

She asked how to log on to it and my partner talked her through it multiple times, turns out she was trying to log in as an admin instead of a user, once she eventually got to the user log in she couldn't remember the password, even though it is and always has been the name of the shop, the shop ID number and a full stop, my partner reminded her of this and still after multiple tries she couldn't get logged in and saying the password wasn't working

She eventually got on after about 10 minutes and hung up my partner, she came and told me and I just laughed and said yep.. Welcome to my life every call!",94,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF85A820>
527,How WiFi turns into Mashed Potatoes,"Edit: Thanks for the Karma and awards and gold!  You’ve all managed to quintuple my karma and make the dopamine center of my brain go crazy!

TLDR: How I fixed the internet and got invited to Thanksgiving Dinner. 

I’m a digital nomad, and I moved into a Airbnb (a garden apartment attached to a house) I’ll be at for a month on Sunday. The WiFi was crappy (low speeds, drops often). Now this isn’t abnormal, especially when I’m staying outside the country, but I’m in Florida. 

This is especially confusing because there is a Google Nest Wifi access point 2 feet from my laptop. 

I message the hosts about it, and they have no idea what to do, although they are very kind and know they need to fix it. 

In these situations I can either pretend I don’t know anything about tech, and hope it gets fixed eventually, or try to be helpful. I go back and forth each time.  But these hosts were rather nice, let me arrive a day early (and didn’t charge me for it!), plus, I’m here a month, and would like good wifi, so I offer to help. 

I used to do IT support, but that was a decade ago. It’s amazing how things never really change. 

They had a Nest mesh router connected to the Cable Modem/Router, and two other mesh access points elsewhere in the house, which their son had setup. As far as everyone in the family was concerned, it was plugged in and there was a blue light, so it’s working!  Thus they were just confused why wifi sucked on both ends of the house (the host had even ordered a separate internet service for the guest quarters on the opposite side of the house from me, as service was almost non existent there. )

When I saw the access point right by me and saw my crappy signal, my assumption was that particular access point had just never been setup. It turns out that all the son had done was plugged things in physically, and never actually setup the network.  We were all using the default cable modem/router network. 

So, I setup the mesh network, advised them on placement and that they order an additional access point (then set that up). Speeds went from 10 to 150 Mbps at the edges of the house, and the network now covers the entire house and yard. The separate internet got cancelled, saving $60/month. 

I then got invited to Thanksgiving dinner and to go Dragon boating. 

Very sadly, I had other Thanksgiving plans, so I was not able to be tech support for the entire extended family yesterday. (Although I still had to fix my Moms printer, ironically by rebooting their router. )",59,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF85A880>
528,Classic Slow Internet Speed,"This is a couple of months old now, and the short of it is I replaced someone's router and they got way better internet speeds.

I'm a physician, and my partner I share an office with turns to me for tech advice, and she loves to save money whenever possible. So a few years back I encouraged her to buy her own modem to work with Comcast, linked her to a refurb model from Woot. Fast forward to 2 months ago, she had been complaining her internet speed was crap for some time, she tried all the steps I taught her like resetting the modem, router. Then she did something I don't usually advise, which is to call Comcast. Comcast told her the modem was outdated, no longer supported. She then bought a new modem (did not check with me on this) and when she told me, I immediately told her to not open the box because I don't think it's a modem issue. I imagine Comcast's scripts say to give that advice and in the long run maybe was trying to sell her their gateway/modem/router.

Anyway so then later I'm at her place and use my phone to verify her speeds are terrible, she's getting 7-8 Mbps in her dining area. The router is in her bedroom which is not very far, but behind a wall. If we walk over to her living room (which is the furthest from the router) the speeds drop to 2-3 Mbps. This was with an iPhone 12 Pro Max which has good antennas. So I tried connecting directly to the modem with a laptop. I didn't have my laptop on me and her newer laptop doesn't have ethernet. Fortunately she keeps everything (becomes relevant in a second) so we find her 10 year old laptop and manage to boot and connect it, running Windows 7, it has ethernet, and when connected to the modem we're gettin 50-75 Mbps. So I explain it's probably her router since the modem is getting fast enough speeds. So finally, I look at the router. It's from 2007. She keeps everything. If I remember correctly it was maybe 802.11n. I laughed quite a bit, and told her how it's crazy she's using a router from >13 yrs ago. Her response was it was meeting her needs, so never felt the need to replace it, and her dad set it up for her a long time ago so she's never thought once about it.

So we do an immediate run to her local Best Buy and I find a WiFi6 router, Linksys. Run back to her home and install it. Repeat speed test in her dining room and it's now 250 Mbps. She is so happy she asks me if she can hug me. (I'm not a hugger). Living room? 250 Mbps. I explain to her that she's been paying for this internet forever, but never been able to utilize what she's been paying for because she was kind of cheaping out on upgrading her equipment. She brushed that off. Now she can even stream 4K to her living room.

I'm always amazed how much people don't want to touch their equipment, or think about upgrading it. I understand the principle of it isn't broken don't fix it, and how tempting that is for a person not familiar with tech. Still, she was being misled by Comcast, and if they did manage to convince her to get their all-in-one device it would have fixed everything but given her the wrong impression about what the actual problem was.",67,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF85A8E0>
529,An interesting RAM installation that I've came across,"Hi,

&#x200B;

sorry if this doesn't read like all the other posts on here. I'm new to posting, I was more of a silent reader. Also english isn't my native language.

&#x200B;

Anyway I was recently asked by a friend of mine, let's call him ""T"", to help a friend of him, I'll call him ""C"", to install more RAM into C's Computer.

I asked no further and aggreed. So while we were driving to C I was talking to him and got to know that he thinks he bought 16 GB of RAM but his system was only showing up 8. I thought ok, maybe this is just a misconfigured BIOS, nothing serious. As I got to his PC and got into the BIOS, I saw that the BIOS was only recognizing 8 GB of RAM. So I powered the machine off and took a look inside, to find 2 8GB Sticks of RAM in there.

Here is where it get's interesting.

I took both 8 GB Sticks out and put them back in. Then I powered the PC on and went into the BIOS again, to see 8 GB of RAM again. Then I was wondering if I myself installed it wrongly. As I've put the first stick out, I saw that I've put it in the wrong way, which many of you might know is impossible, so thought I.

I then tried to put it in the wrong way knowingly to see if it would make a clicking noise. It did. I then took a deeper look inside the RAM slot itself and saw that C managed to put so much force on both the RAM stick and slot to put it in the wrong way. The notch inside the slot was pressed down. I then put it in the right way to see it clicking there too. So nobody would think this slot would have survived a misuse like that, because not only is it physically damaged but maybe electrically too every pin got wired up differently so maybe also data swapped with power.

But as I put it in the right way and booted the machine into the BIOS again, it was showing up both of the 8 GB Sticks, adding up to C's full 16 GB of RAM that he bought. I then just configured XMP and booted into Windows, to find all 16 GB of RAM showing up and working correctly. He never had a problem since that.

&#x200B;

I think this story again shows how strong PC hardware sometimes can be. Let me know if you liked this story, I certainly did find it very interesting. Thanks for reading.",173,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF85A940>
530,Wifi = HUH...?,"For the past 6 or so months, I've been doing level 1 support for a mobile app. I had a chat today for the app, where the person doesn't understand what wifi is or how it's used. below is chat I had:

Me = Me

Me - thank you. are you connected to wifi?

User -    ???

I wouldn’t have a clue how to do that

me -       alright, please go to settings > wifi > that screen should list if you are connected to a wifi signal or not

531,Some people just don't add up.,"I worked as a teaching assistant on a college course that taught how to build, upgrade, and maintain simple PC systems like you would get at home.

The course was 12 weeks with the first 2 weeks being getting to know the different parts inside a PC. After that was the usual installing windows, upgrading, fault finding, simple networking, etc.

In any group there is always one person who will struggle and needs a bit of extra support. This is the one I had to help many times with little hints and nudges to point him in the right direction throughout the whole of the course. I'll call him ""N"".

At the start of the lessons, the computers, monitors, keyboards, mice, and all the cables that the class were working with had to be brought out of the storage cupboard and put away again at the end of the lesson as the room was used for other purposes during the week.

Week 11 was typing up the notes you had ready to be added to the electronic test taken on week 12.

Week 11 comes round and the tutor opened up the room for the students to use the word processors to type up their work while the tutor and I set up some simple fault finding tasks in the teaching room.

N comes in and says the computer to type up his work isn't working. We tell him to use another and we will be through shortly. Less than 5 minutes later he's back. The other computer isn't working either.

This is really odd as the college has an IT team and the tutor is head of that team. If a computer wasn't working he'd know.

Anyway, I follow N to the other room and ask him to show me which computer he was at. He showed me and I immediately knew what he had done wrong. The power light was lit on the monitor, but not on the desktop PC. I pressed the power button on the PC, waited for it to boot to login, logged in for him and went back to the teaching room. When I told the tutor the problem he just sighed and shook his head.

This wasn't the last time N stuck that week.

After everyone in the class had had a go at fixing the faults we set up, we packed everything away and went back to the other room to work on our teaching notes and help those that were struggling. Cue N.

We could hear a lot of grunting coming from a corner of the room where N was sitting. The grunts quickly got louder and then the banging started. One extremely loud grunt followed by what sounded like a fist bashing the keyboard and the tutor and I quickly rushed over to see what was wrong.

N was so frustrated he was sweating and saying that the text won't go down the page. I asked what he meant and he pointed to a paragraph on the screen. He said he wanted that bit lower down so he could put something above it, then started bashing away on the space bar. ""See"" he said, ""It's not moving.""

Instead of pressing the ""Return"" key to advance a line, he's been adding spaces.

It turns out N had a PC at home that he had never used so joined the course to learn how to use it.",85,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF85AA00>
532,No internet? Must be the firewall,"This incident actually happened after I retired from my University sysadmin job.  I still had an email account which I checked every couple of days, and one weekend I found I couldn't check this account.  System was unreachable so I tried a couple of other systems, also saw the website was not available.  The entire network was un reachable.    

Not a big deal for me, maybe they were doing some network upgrade or something.   A couple of hours go by and I get a call from the guy that took over when I retired.  He's out of town for the weekend, his boss is calling him because the link from the department to the upstream network is down, and the network engineer they are talking to is insisting that the problem must be internal, probably the firewall.  Network guy wants the FW rebooted, he won't keep working on the problem unless this is done first.   So, if I can, will I go in and reboot the FW?   There is no one else in town who knows the systems.  I'm not doing anything so I agree.

Since its a Sunday I arrange access to the building and head on in.  Arrive, get access to the server room, find the FW, reboot.   No change.  For yucks I follow the fiber connection from the FW box the to edge switch, maybe a gbic is bad or something.  

There is no link on the switchport to the upstream fiber.  OK, I swap the gbic since there are a couple of extras sitting on the switch, no difference.  Clearly this is NOT the FW box.  I'm updating my local contact, who I know from the old days, who is on the phone with the Network Guy.  He grumpily agrees to look at the upstream switch again.  Local contact then tells me that NG is asking if I have a copy of the upstream switch configuration.  

I'm totally surprised.   Why would the department have a saved config for switch we don't admin?  We have a clumsy three way conversation about this and it becomes clear that there is more to this story than meets the eye.   Problem started with a scheduled power outage for electrical upgrades to the building.   Everything appeared to come back up after power was restored, but the uplink did not.

I had seen this multiple times when I was working at this place.   The network guys would make changes to switch configs and FORGET to save the config.  Months go by, there's a power outage, and when the switches come up, the config is incorrect, you're routes are GONE.

Anyway, I left, the Network Guy eventually figured out what was wrong with the config and fixed it, and uplink connection was back. 

I just hope he saved the config before he went on to his next ticket.",53,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF85AA60>
533,I plugged in the cable like you said and now nothing works...,"Just a quick reminder that some people really have no tech skills whatsoever. (Also mobile format, sorry)

I went to a client's house to look over their laptop and monitors which weren't connecting.

When I arrived, I noticed the client had a USB hub connected to their laptop, and a docking station, which was located underneath the table,  connected to the hub. This has nothing to do with the actual issue I was there to fix, but I suggested to the client that they buy an  extension cable so they can plug the USB hub into the docking station directly to power the USB devices.
The client listened to my advice and bought an extension cable from me.

I arrived into work the next day to the following email:
Hi Fwog
I came into the shop yesterday and the attached blue cable is what you sold me. 
It does not work with my set up.
Do you have something that will?
Client.

There were 2 photos attached to the email, one was the cable I sold them, and the other was of the hub with every USB cable still plugged in, including the docking station USB cable.

I had to pointed that out to them and needless to say, I haven't heard from them since.


BONUS: I spent 2 hours on a call with a call centre trying to get a VoIP password for a client. The password the company provided my client was incorrect and the password they provided me was similar, but also incorrect.

After 2 hours with them I decided to try a mixture of the passwords they had provided (mainly different capitalisation) and got the phones to work.

Turns out they gave me a password with too many characters, and my client a password with the wrong capitalisation. Just had to use my clients password, with the capitalisation from my password to get it.

534,"""Can you fix my slow PC?"" aka the user who wished for unlimited RAM","~~Short~~ and sweet one for you, before I head into work. This happened about a month ago, a user opened a ticket about her laptop being slow. We'll call her Sally. Totally not because she's a letter swap away from being what she really is (silly).

Now, important thing to note is her laptop is the same model as mine. Issued roughly same date too. Same amount of RAM, everything. I'll be the first to admit I have some really really terrible habits when it comes to keeping tabs open. But I remote into this user's machine and... yeah, it's really slow. Like, I start task manager, and I got time to go get a glass of water before it's started.

I spend some time checking out the machine. 8gb of RAM, but she's got like 50 tabs open of Chrome across 5 windows, about 10 pdf's open in acrobat reader, a dozen or so different Word and Excel documents open, and none of it minimized. Task Manager reports her RAM is capped out, in addition to about 5GB of page file. My final check was the CPU Up time.

I'm disappointed in myself normally for having a CPU uptime on my personal PC that's right now at 5 days. But this woman? Try 25 days. I don't think she's ever shut down this machine in her life. No wonder the damn thing is slow she's basically torturing the damn thing.

So after I've done with my check, I wait for her to get back to her laptop because of course she basically said ""I'm going on my break, remote in and fix it thanks"" and the conversation goes as follows.

> Me: **I've had a look at your computer, and I've identified 3 possible reasons your PC is slow-**

> Sally: **Have you fixed it? It's still slow...**

> Me: **Yes, it's still slow. I was just about to explain why it's slow and how you can prevent it from being slow in the future-**

> Sally: **But you are IT, not me. Can't you fix it?**

> Me: **I can fix it, but you'd need to save your work first. Firstly, you have too many tabs open in chrome-**

> Sally: **I need all of them.**

> Me: **Do you need all of them right now? Or could you close some of them and re-open them when you need them?**

> Sally: **No I need them all. Just fix it**

> Me: **Ok, well the other thing is that you only have 8gb of RAM. You can't have this many things open at once with only 8gb of RAM.**

> Sally: **Can you increase the RAM?**

> Me: **Perhaps, but you'll need to get your manager to approve it, and it'll come out of your department's budget. And they'll contact me and I'll tell them that you keep 50 tabs open, and if you stop that it might speed up.**

> Sally: **Well then I'll get more RAM. Is that it?**

> Me: **Well there is one last fix that I can attempt. You haven't shut down your computer in forever, if you reboot your machine it might speed up.**

> Sally: **I close the lid every day is that not enough?**

> Me: **No, it isn't. Here's how you shut it down PROPERLY.** *(proceeds to show her the shut down button in start menu)* **Do this every day when you leave for home. When you next use the machine, press the power button on the machine to turn it back on. Your laptop will be faster then.**

> Sally: **Ok thanks then.** *click*

535,"It's not the system's fault, it's your fault","I'm not sure if this is worthy of TFTS, or if it's just a rant. It might be just an excuse for me to vent, in which case, thank you guys, you are cheaper than a therapist.

I work for an Assets Management Firm as a guy who manages their software and databases (not an ""IT guy"", as I don't deal with hardware, and IT can't troubleshoot the issues I deal with).

We have a neat software that keeps track of our transactions and balances. Basically, it shows you how much you own for each asset in each fund, and has workflows to start a new trade to buy or sell those assets (among many other useful things).

There are many checks the software does to conform to fiscal regulations as well as security compliances. For example, it won't let you buy assets from a Tobacco firm if your fund only allows a certain percentage of its capital to be invested in that industry, and most importantly, it doesn't allow you to oversell a position, EVER.

Now, what happens within the software is not what happens in the real world: the software keeps track of the orders, but doesn't actually push the trades. The way it works is, traders are on the phone with other traders, or third-party brokers, agreeing on a deal, then both parties (figuratively) shake hands, and everybody goes on their merry way to scribble their checks and balances on their respective platforms.

In my case, the traders check the system to see how much cash we have available, decide what's best to be invested in, do their phone calls, and then send an email to the middle office grunts who capture that trade in the system so that tomorrow the new amounts are reflected. At least, that's how it *should* work.

The thing is, you can start many sale orders for the same trade, but only execute them IF you have enough capital for that position (again, WE CANNOT OVERSELL). So, if I own $100,000 of product A, I can book two sales for $100,000, but if I execute the first one, then I cannot execute the second one because I no longer own enough of product A. Only executed transactions are sent to the back office and are considered official amounts.

So, we get an email from $user with ""oversell"" in the subject (which again, is a BIG no no since it could expose the firm to liabilities and fines), so of course I panic. I start investigating, but find that the software *still* doesn't allow oversales, so I sigh in relief. I go back to $user saying ""Preposterous! Our software doesn't allow oversales!"" with a screenshot of the error message saying ""You cannot oversell a position"", and I leave it at that.

$user, however, comes back saying ""well, the system allowed me to sell a position twice"". Puzzled, I check all trades, check audit trails, balances, and all I can see is one sale captured. I reply ""that's not possible, there is only one sale executed. There are a couple of orders booked, but none of those can be executed since we no longer hold that position"".

Well, it turns out $user sold the position twice, BY PHONE. Whereas other traders check the balances before taking a decision, this trader has a group of analysts booking orders based on those balances which the trader then executes via phone call, without checking the balances first, and then pushes it on the software. So, what happened was that $analyst1 thought it was a good idea to sell position A, but $analyst2 had the same idea, so both booked the sales in the system. Then $user made phone calls to confirm one trade, executed the trade on the system, then later that day made a second phone call for the other trade, and when trying to push the second execution, the system blurted back ""You cannot oversell a position"".

And somehow this is the fault of the software...",76,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF85AB80>
536,"""I cannot access my computer"", aka how a power failure confused a user with poor power-off habits.","Been a while since my last post here. Been a while since my last job in IT. But I come with a short one because sometimes I cannot believe how incompetent some people can be when it comes to basic computer usage in 2021.

In this story that takes place during one of the many lockdowns we've experienced over these past two years, I was working from home as an I.T. Engineer for an undisclosed MSP. The ""customers"" I'd work with are staff members responsible for either teaching english-as-a-second-language students, college students, or recruitment partners for job hunting services.

Our systems are pretty heavily into the whole microsoft ""everything-as-a-service"", single sign-on ecosystem. Office 365, MS Teams, etc etc. Even logging into the WiFi in-office relies on your current login details in AD. During lockdown, we had to overhaul our IT security so that certain systems couldn't be accessed without a company VPN, which changed configurations like 3 times, and didn't support some protocol that Windows insisted on enabling for the VPN profile. This is very relevant, I assure you.

One day, while I'm seeing to my current project of ensuring all devices in our network are running the latest version of windows, I get an urgent support request from a user. Let's call this person Dianna. Dianna tells me that she cannot access the computer, and that she needs access immediately.

Now, many of you might be thinking expired password. I was at first too. Our password policy is that passwords invalidate after 6 months, but you can still log into the computer if you aren't connected to the domain. I reset her password and get her to try and login, but she just says she cannot access her computer.

I ask her to tell me if there are any errors when she tries to login. Same response. I ask her for her asset tag, so I can remote in. She gives me this, but our remote management software doesn't see her device as online. I tried asking her to turn it off and on again, and I actually get a new response this time. She tells me that the computer is sleeping.

The way she said it, it felt weirdly phrased. After pressing some more, I discover that the monitor was actually going into sleep mode, and she was just turning the monitor on and off. when she was/wasn't using it. To save you the blow by blow, I then spent about 15 minutes getting her to understand that her PC wasn't the monitor, but the thing the monitor was plugged into, in this case her work laptop. She couldn't understand why it didn't just work because that's how it had worked for so long until now.

It turned out that her house had experienced a power failure overnight, which lasted several hours. All our devices after being imaged are configured to never switch off while on charge, but they do go into hibernate if they are left on for over 2 hours on battery. When her power restored, the machine had already switched off and had to be manually switched on, but she had never done this in the lifespan of her using the device. She just thought the monitor she had attached to it was all she needed to do.

So after that little lesson, I took the opportunity to make sure she could login, that everything was working, and called it a day. 40 minute call, just to get her to press the right power button.",168,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF85ABE0>
537,The Curious Case of The Rebooting Server,"Ding! UKHRDPYRL002 has gone offline.

I watched the Solarwinds display. In a few seconds... Aha, there it is. UKHRDPYRL001 offline.

For this one, I was in storied Hereford, brought in as a consultant to help them work out why their payroll servers kept rebooting.

This company was not a tech company, so its higher IT management was made up of all financial professionals, not a single techie in sight. When a big budget project to virtualise the datacentre came along, that then became the entire IT department. IT had Service Desk, Work Order Fuilfillment and Infrastructure, but didn't have a single applications or business systems professional. One of the VMWare guys sort of knew how to create CSRs in IIS and that's about it.

Big skills gap they didn't even know they had.

My role here was to work with the payroll vendor and work out why the servers kept rebooting. Of course the payroll vendor had given their software a clean bill of health. In their IT Director's words, they needed a ""blended skillset"", their words for someone who knew the faintest concept of server applications and, indeed, application servers.

Back in the real world, both payroll servers were back up and I shot off an email to the Active Directory guy. ""What's the documented purpose of GBDS\\payroll-svc? That account rebooted the servers.""

He replied that, from the name, he thought that's the service account the payroll system used. I couldn't find any trace of it. It wasn't authenticating to SQL with it. It wasn't running services or app pools as it.

Finally, I found a scheduled task called ""Watchdog"". This very much piqued my interest. It was a VBS script which seemed to query the payroll system and then restart IIS, restart services and, if stuff was still in some state, reboot the server.

Okay, so just disable the scheduled task? Aha, no, for we don't know why it's there.

I go back to my contact. ""What's the last payroll issue you  had anyone  consulting in for?"" He had no idea. It was years and years ago.

The IT Director, copied in, actually knew the answer. Sometimes payroll would hang, and so need the services restarting.

I pieced together the clues. The VBS was quite telling.

1. Does payroll system complete a web call within 120 seconds?
2. Restart services and IIS if not.
3. Wait 120 seconds
4. Go to 1. If we've been to 4 before, continue
5. Reboot server

A smaller organisation had an issue with the payroll system, but restarting it fixed the problem. The consultant had belt-n-braces it and rebooted the server if the system failed to come back online.

Over time the organisation had grown, the final straw being an acquisition. The API call being used was asking for a list of all payroll numbers, appropriate for a smaller system, but wasn't going to complete in time today, so the check failed more than it succeeded.

Restarting the services also now took too long, so the wait in step 3 wasn't long enough. The script looped once, step 1 failing the second time as the services are still starting back up, so we go to reboot the server.

Armed with this knowledge, I disabled step 5 in the script and changed step 3 to 600 seconds, then went to the vendor with my findings.

The vendor was aghast that the client was doing this, and showed them how to properly implement a watchdog timer on the system.",30,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF85AC40>
538,"""All these POS terminals keep shutting down!""","Years ago, I was the top contact for Point-of-Sale support for a high end hotel chain in the US.

One day, I got a call from our San Diego location. They were setting up 6 bar terminals for a Comic-Con event that evening, and all of them kept randomly shutting down and restarting.

I was a bit mystified, because it was happening randomly to each terminal (as opppsed to all at once). At one point, their on-site tech mentioned that it was kind of hard to read the screen, but i didn't think much of it.

Everything looked fine from a network perspective, until the machines would indeed randomly restart after 10-15 minutes. Very unusual behavior, and it wasn't affecting any of the 20ish other identical terminals at the hotel.

After speaking with the on-site tech for about 45 minutes, he reveals some key information while making chit-chat. 

""Man, it's so hot out here.""

""...Wait, are you outside?""

""Yeah, I think they said it was the hottest it's ever been this time of year.""

""OK. And these terminals are all outside?

"" Yep.""

""Are they in direct sunlight?""

""Uh huh.""

""On the hottest day on record... Um, I think I've figured out what is going on. Set up some umbrellas over the terminals, and let's hope there's no permanent damage.""",99,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF85ACA0>
539,The Google box,"Any time someone comes up with a theory about how the government is tracking us all with Covid vaccines or conspiring with BigCorp to stock pile their favourite cereal and drive up the prices, I know they've never worked in the public sector. If you have, you know that they would be incapable of thinking of it, ill-equiped to execute it, and physically indisposed to avoid bragging about it if they pulled off something so cool.

Here's how the employment turnover works. You have a team with a certain number of roles. Any time there's a vacancy the new person comes in full of ideas and ways to improve the ridiculous systems, so they try. They bang their head against all the walls, floor and ceiling. They do way more work than everyone else in the team. Eventually they say ""fuck this"" and quit. This process repeats ad-infinitum until through the probability of deviation, a slacker gets the rotating vacancy. That slacker looks around and sees a world where they can get away with doing no work. That seat is now filled forever. And is stays like this until someone retires, dies, emigrates or is hit by a meteorite.

This was my experience. Sat in the office, about half way to quitting, when the IT Director sticks his head around the door and announces proudly to the team ""I've bought us a Google Box"". This is quite surprising that some equipment has been bought without any involvment of the people who look after the network and servers. Like I said, I was only half way to quitting, and I'd still be surprised by things like this. I was also surprised that I'd have to fight and argue about having an extra redundant hard drive in a server that had no backup server. It wasn't that I wanted more money, but the space would be the total of 2 hard drives, and not 3, like the boss wanted. They were so tight with money that everything was a fight. Yet now we have a Google Box.

""What's that do then?"" I ask. ""Well"", the boss starts, ""you plug it into your network and it indexes all the files on your network much like Google does, and then you configure an address and you can search your own network, and you don't even have to manage it"".

A large part of IT design is looking for the problems. It annoys a lot of people because you piss on their bonfire. If their bonfire is next to a box of fireworks, it's worth pissing on though. Not that a bonfire isn't great, but it needs some work. I start thinking about the Google box for about 3 seconds. I literally think it took me this long to come up with the question, and in all the time of looking at it online and going through the purchasing stage, not once did my boss think ""So how do you stop it indexing something?"". ""Why would you need to?"" he dumbly asks with his dumb face. ""Well, we don't want HR and finance records available and searchable for all to see, even a preview or cached version. How do you prevent that?"".

Three things happened after I asked that question. 1, the boss said ""Huh. I'll have to look into that"". 2, the boss left our office, far less proudly that he entered. 3, the Google box sat on top of one of the server racks unused until the day I left. Return it and get our money back? Nah, why would we do that?",42,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF85AD00>
540,It's All in the Details,"LTL FTP here, or at least, I think so. I work for a large collections agency as Desktop Support. I've been out of IT for some time now, but recently stepped back in, about a month now, and honestly am sad I left, but I digress.

I get a message from my boss about a request that has been approved, asking me if I can take care of it. No problem, I look up the request and it's for sourcing assets. I'm thinking, okay maybe it's a new hire, but I didn't see a new hire come through my email and we don't typically do new hires in the middle of the week.

The request turns our to be from HR, asking for a docking station. Now, our SLA's start at 10 days for a P4, also known as a ""request"", which I find to be lengthy, but not my call. Which I thought, with WFH, maybe they need one for home. Assign the ticket to myself and proceed to go to lunch, cuz foodz is good.

I get back to a message from HR stating that they will be leaving in 20 minutes and really need the dock replace for the amount of work load. Mind you, I didn't see this ticket until 11:30am, right as I'm headed out for lunch. That was 40 minutes ago, well you're not getting your dock today then. I did think to myself ""did you not just use one of the displayport cables and plug into your laptop"", but that's thinking too smart for the end user.

I send a message back (mostly covering my hide, as I technically have 10 days to complete the request) stating that if something like this were to happen in the future, please open an incident ticket,  and we're not waiting on an approved request, which can take up to a day. The SLA for a P3 is still 5 days, but we tend to take care of them within the day. Get a reply back next day, they will be in on Monday or Tuesday and thanks for my help.

I had a good chuckle at this, nice person, but when I see a P4, I certainly don't jump, no matter who it is. I'll update with the outcome, because I'm curious to see if the dock is burnt out, or unplugged.  


Update: I completely forgot about this post, not gonna lie. I did end up replacing the dock and bringing it back into the office. Plugged it in, hooked it up to my laptop, and what do you know, external monitors come to life and everything is working. My guess is they managed to bump a cable and unplug it from the power strip.",2,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF85AD60>
541,"You can lead a man to knowledge, but beating him incessantly over the head with it won't make him learn.","It is the time of year where my department starts conducting training for our company dealerships located all over the US and a few placed overseas.  Last year the pandemic forced us to do it all totally online.  This actually worked great for a few products and those are now only going to be taught online going forward.    

I got assigned one of these to teach this year and decided I should watch the recording from last year.  This will let me figure out the format it used along with any updates or changes where I could make it better.  

This training talked about a topic for 5-7 minutes, asked some review questions the students answered in the zoom chat, then allowed students to ask questions before moving onto topic 2 where the format repeated.  

Topic 1 was all about compatibility.  It clearly and repeatedly states that controller A only works with option A and the newer controller B only works with option B.  They look the same but mix and match shit isn't going to fly.  Then it moved onto the review questions where question 1 was if controller A would function with option B.  Everyone typed NO in the comments like good little student and onto the next question.  

When it was time for the students to ask questions, the first one to appear in the chat window was, ""All my option A's are on back order.  Can I use the option B's to finish the installations instead?""

542,A tale of Duo permissions,"Long time lurker, first time poster. For reference, I've worked for an MSP for 4 years on the network engineering side of the house. Just recently I was tasked with testing out Duo for our customers because a lot of cyber security insurance required 2FA on Windows devices and everything else, and because of the price, my company didn't want to adopt Duo sooner.


Now a couple of days ago, we got our Duo account bumped up to an MSP partner account, and we decided to go forward with offering it to our clients. This meant that I needed to create admin accounts for more people in the organization, such as our partner relations lady, who I guess must be the most technically inclined person in the organization (even though she can't figure out how to ring my extension on the company phone), because the second I did that she took away all admin rights and made every admin account, except hers, a helpdesk account.


If you've never worked with Duo before, let me shed some light on their permissions quick. Your highest two levels are Owner and Administrator. Owner is completely unrestricted, they can do everything, so naturally you'd only want a couple accounts at this level, in my head that would be me and the one other person who has done any sort of Duo training. The next level, Administrator, has similar permissions to Owner except for the two big caveats that they can't create or change other admin account permissions, and they can't view or edit billing information. 


It's important to note that in Duo's terms Admin refers to anyone with an account that has access to the organizations admin panel, and administrator refers to the permission level that I just described.


 So, for some godforsaken reason, the operations person I referred to earlier is the person in the company that's in charge of creating people's accounts and updating billing information, but if you couldn't tell by my sarcasm earlier, she has no actual technical skill, so of course I don't actually want to give her Owner rights, but Duo has no way (that I found in the time that I had) to give admins custom rights, such as ""give this admin administrator right and billing rights"" or ""give this admin user rights and application rights"" you can only select one. 


So this leads to the most annoying part of the story. I had to create the operations lady's account as an Owner so she could do her job, even though she shouldn't be in charge of creating admins since she doesn't have any Duo training, and doesn't know how to read the summary of what each permission level does. The first thing she does, as mentioned earlier, is make every account a helpdesk account, without calling me, the person who knows what's up with Duo, then she doesn't send anything out to notify me or the other guy of the permission change. So here I am going to create a setup document for Duo, and I find out that I can't create test users, I can't give more people panel access, I can't even setup a new Duo application to be protected.


I emailed her to find out if she changed my permissions to which she say ""Yes I did. Call me, for some reason your extension doesn't ring."" No one else in the company, i.e. 45 other people, has ever had issues calling my extension, which leads back to the technical level of this operations employee. So I call her, sent to voicemail. Call her a couple hours later, sent to voicemail.


So here's where we're at, I'm supposed to give a presentation on how Duo works today, but since I don't have any rights, I'm just going to tell the CEO that until this lady gets over her power trip, we can't implement Duo, which means our customers can't get cyber security insurance without finding a new MSP.


The moral of the story: my company has a poor way of assigning roles and Duo has poor way of assigning permissions. Thanks for coming to my TEDTalk.


Also please refer any formatting complaints to my operations lady, I'm on mobile.

Edit: spelling, it was early, I was mad.



Update: probably won't be your favorite update, but here we go. Didn't come up in the meeting, some other things took precedence. I sent a rather harsh, at least for me, email to her, CCing my boss and the CEO. Got nothing all day until CEO called me toward the end. Got a bit of a scolding for the email, which is fair, like I said, I was mad.

 
Apparently this was protocol due to some things that happened prior to my time here. I didn't go through the proper channels when setting up a new partner account, primarily because I wasn't told what they were, I was just following orders. CEO apologized for the lack of communication, which was my whole issue, like if you're going to change my permissions, tell me first. Our Duo rollout is on hold, obviously since I didn't get my permissions back, but oh well, guess we'll see if we ever get there.


As for people talking about how she shouldn't have owner permissions in the first place, I agree, I think that should be saved for service managers and the CEO, but that's how her job is setup, she's the internal point of contact for all of our vendors and in charge of creating external accounts for our people. I don't fully know why, but I imagine it has something to do with accountability. 


All that said, I do think that Duo's permissions should be check boxes rather than radio buttons, so that you can make someone both application manager and user manager, or whatever combination you need, rather than giving them administrator rights, or requiring multiple accounts. As it stands now, I can't currently test some of the applications that we're going to want for some of our clients, and while the Duo setup process is fairly straight forward, it's still not something I want to put in production until I test things.


There's a small part of me that still hopes her phone breaks over the weekend so that we're locked out of Duo entirely until she gets a new one.",49,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF85AE20>
543,Your boss said you can get my data back...,"First post here, so a little introduction, I work in a computer store in Belgium for almost 14years now.

Before I could ask anything he continued that de disks where disks out of a hard drive... 🤦🏻‍♂️
I told him that it was not possible and that the disks now are broken and that he lost his data. The person getting annoyed and start telling that he came to my boss to ask if we can get data out of ext HDD's that couldn't be read, my boss explained him that we can try it, that we take out the HDD out of the enclosure and can try it like that, but that wasn't guaranteed. So he went back home and took out the hard drive out of the enclosure by himself, but also opening the hard drive to get the disks out... He started to get a little bit mad and start complaining that my boss doesn't know what he was talking about and give him faulty information. I tried to explain him again that it was only taking out de HDD of the enclosure.. Then the customer left being mad that he lost his data and lost 80€ for a hard drive.

I get a call from one of my stores saying that their cash register at the first drive thru window shut off and wont power back on.

Still no luck. Not even a bios screen. So I crack it up to hardware failure and make my way over there with a spare register to swap it out with. I arrive at the restaurant to find a space heater on the table blowing DIRECTLY on the register. At this point I’m thinking, oh come on now they can’t be this clueless. So I turn the space heater to “fan” mode and cool down the register for a few minutes. Power it up and everything works perfectly. I called in the manager to inform them that the space heater blowing directly on the register caused the computer to overheat and that’s why it wouldn’t turn on.

An elderly gent called up and explained to me that ""I'm watching a TV program, but theres a man explaining whats happening on the screen. How do I turn it off?""I ask if he has subtitles on, he said no, there was a male voice explaining what was happening on the TV screen.I asked him to change his channel to see if its happening on his other programs and the answer is no.

I then explained to him that some TV shows air things with people explaining whats going on for visually impaired people, so they know whats going on. The customer asked me if there was a way to turn it off.

I had to explain for the next five minutes that its not a setting, the show was taped that way like when you watch a documentary with animals, they add the voice over it and it wouldn't effect his other shows.He eventually understood and thanked me before hanging up. Bless him I wanted to hug him.

546,power is off but work anyway,"This is one the just demonstrates general management silliness.   At the time this happened I ran the support staff for a computer intensive department at a University.  Our building was offices, labs, administration, no classrooms at all.  

One summer there was construction going on to the building next door to our building, and a backhoe managed to cut through an underground power cable that fed our building.   Luckily no one was hurt but apparently the upstream transformer was damaged, in addition to the power cable being cut.  Our building was also the ""hub"" for power for three other buildings, so those three buildings had no power either.

It took only a couple of minutes for us to figure out what had happened, and various administrators started calling around to see if they could send us home.  This was summer in the Southwest U.S. so the building started getting hot and stuffy.  None of the windows could be opened anywhere in the building.  And of course we had NO lights, NO computers, NO elevators, NO network.  

Word came back from the Grand Poobah Administrators.  Everyone should ""work as best they can"", hoping that the power would be restored quickly.  So we did.  I went to my office, put my back to a window, and read some technical articles in a trade magazine.   While the building got hotter and hotter.  Some folks went outside and camped out in the shade.  All our admin tools were only available online, plus the temperature in the building was climbing by the minute.  Outside temp was probably around 100 F.  

Then we got the word that our campus electricians, working with the local power utility, were saying they might not be able to get a replacement transformer until the next day.  It wasn't noon yet and people were getting pretty pissed off at being told to hang around doing nothing, just because no one in higher admin wanted to take responsibility for putting us all on ""administrative leave"" for half a day.  Supposedly this had budgeting implications, like closing the campus due to snow.

Then the batteries on the emergency lights in the stairwells started to fail.  This cranked up the possibility of folks being injured, which really made the admin folks nervous.   Vision of worker's comp claims, law suits, bad media coverage started making the rounds.

I actually didn't mind hanging around since once power was restored I was going to have to make sure all my servers came back up properly so I didn't want to drive home and have to turn around and drive back.   But finally we got the word, we were all released to go home, and everyone needed to provide a contact number so they could update us later.  These were the days before everyone had a cell phone.  

I was half way home when I got a call on my cell, power was back up.  It had been maybe a bit over an hours since they sent us home, no idea how they fixed it so fast.   I could come back if I wanted or wait until the next day, I turned right around and headed back, I knew I needed a couple of hours to make sure everything was back to normal.

So everything was back to normal by end of business and no one got hurt, but seeing the buck passing going on with administration over a common sense issue was eye opening.",64,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF85AFA0>

Like... you woke up, ate some breakfast, grabbed a coffee, sat in traffic, came to work, clocked in... and now it's your life mission to just make one specific person feel completely miserable with 100% malicious intent?

That's how this person has been feeling about me for the last 2 months ever since I deployed her thin client and shipped it to her house where she works remote in another state. I've built umpteen thin clients and laptops by now, I can do 10 of them at the same time with my eyes closed. All manually too, no scripting or using image files. I know exactly what's on every machine because we get them brand spanking new and I'm the grunt who installs everything and authenticates new users so that when they receive their shit, they're good to go right out of the box.

We'll call her Korra because man she gets on my nerves and is angsty as shit when she opens her mouth, but since Avatar The Last Airbender was so amazing I constantly give her a chance.

Everything she says that's either working or not working, or even things she just observes... apparently everything tech related is out to get her. I think she might be a paranoid schitzo? I really don't know. Here are some examples of her questions, and her voice is ALWAYS shaking with triggering anger and upset vibes, it's been so incredibly awkward:

**""Why are my personal files showing up on my work computer?""** \--After she had signed into her personal OneDrive on her work computer...

**""Why do I have to go to** [**microsoft.com**](https://microsoft.com) **to change my password? Every time I try to go there it redirects me to a different site and that's something the IT Team needs to take care of.""** \--I tell her again, because we do everything in the cloud... and it's not redirecting you, it's sending you to the English, United States version of the website (referring to how typing in [www.microsoft.com](https://www.microsoft.com) changes to [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/))

**""How am I supposed to keep my programs secure and up to date when I can't install them?""** \--Because you're not an administrator and we've gone over multiple times how you are to send in a ticket when you need anything installed or updated. That is my job, not yours.

**""Why does it show I'm signed into multiple computers??? See I told you somebody is in my system!!!""** \--Because you left your machine at home when you went to visit the office 2 weeks ago and and I helped you sign into a vacant computer while you were there.

**""How come everyone has a VPN and I'm the only one lacking security?""** \--Nobody else has a VPN, you're looking at their screen and seeing Norton VIP which is a token/2FA tool for banking... and you're not in that department. I don't install things that people don't need and I'm not treating others with more secure machines and not you. That would make no sense.

***Here's the real kicker and I'll make it the last one because I can go on forever with her:***

""SOMEBODY EDITED THE PDF I SAVED WITH ALL MY PASSWORDS AND ALSO EDITED THE EMAIL YOU SENT ME WITH ALL MY PASSWORDS, THIS IS A COMPROMISE OF COMPLIANCE AND SECURITY AND I'VE CC'D MY SUPERIORS ON THIS ISSUE. IT'S UP TO THE IT TEAM TO FIX THIS"" --This was the last straw for me. Now she's calling us out for not doing our jobs, of which for the most part there hasn't been much remediating, mostly just telling her HEY DUMB DUMB EVERYTHING IS FINE, STOP TRIPPIN.

Your sent or received emails aren't being edited... that's not how it works. You saved the wrong email as a PDF. ""No I didn't"" she said. ""I'm sorry, yes you did"" I would say. And I continued: ""When I sent you the welcome email, I used a template and I copy and pasted from the last new hire. One of the usernames was incorrect so I apologized and sent you another one, remember?"" She'd say ""Yes I remember you sending me another one, that's the one I saved."" Me: ""The PDF you saved doesn't have the incorrect username from the first welcome email?"" Her: ""Yes it does"" Me: ""So... you saved the incorrect email."" Her: ""No, I know for a fact I saved the corrected email you sent after.""

Denial is weird.

&#x200B;

Some people just can't get certain things through their heads. Apparently she had been giving her team a terrible time the last few months, and this incident was the last straw after I called to talk to her superior about the fact that I can't seem to get through to her and I'm doing everything that I can. Always have a paper trail, always explain everything as best as you can. My boss and her boss knew what was up immediately after our last conversation. You gotta always cover your ass and you gotta always stand up for yourself.

I rock at my basic help desk job and I love every minute being here and learning. Fuck up on out of here if you're trying to tell me I'm not doing my job when you're a paranoid individual, that's not my problem.

A half hour later HR sends in a ticket to disable her Microsoft account immediately.

&#x200B;

Edit: I never used the name I designated her in the beginning lol I'm dumb, and actually for the most part I really enjoyed The Legend of Korra",240,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF85B040>
548,Secure data - SQL database testing,"Some years ago I worked in an educational establishment. One of the many jobs I undertook was to rebuild an SQL database that had been so badly designed that it had failed after 5 years. I didn't think that was possible, but anyway...

So I had to rebuild all the various functions and add a few more (using Excel), but I replaced a lot of the code in a manner that would be *sort of* future proofed. To do this I had to test the functionality, but the data was all subject to data protection law. There is an easy fox for testing.

The Head (or principal) wanted an update, so I shared a data set, and she accused me of revealing sensitive data - a fireable offence, until I pointed out the names in the data set...

Harry Potter, Darth Vader, Billy NoMates, and so on. All dummy data. 

Well, I didn't get fired as there was no data protection issue, and finished the project about a month later.

Good times.",29,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF85B0A0>
549,"School emails are too large, please","I was trained in help desk. Naturally, when I joined the parents and teachers association they soon divined this and rolled their technical questions at me. One item on the agenda was email size. Parents had been complaining their daily fest of image packed emails would exceed their mailbox limits. 

Without putting much effort in I gave them three solutions, in ascending order of merit. You could compress them, not recommended because dumb people. You could load the images onto your own website and simply post text with URLs for them to download the graphics, or not. Or my very own favourite, you could simply opt out, either of the image laden emails or the whole daily data fest.

A teacher turned to me and explained we weren't talking about that, but about ... sending emails home to parents. I duly apologised in case I hadn't fully understood the issues. But still remained amused that she was allegedly there to teach some people some things.",74,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF85B100>
550,Dial 896 To Reboot The Internet,"Back in the beginning of my consulting days, I had a lot of small clients. Usually just offices of 4-10 users with basic needs. The pay wasn't great, but the work was consistent. These companies never could afford a decent MSP and didn't have the revenue to support a full-time IT tech. So it was either the President's kid did the IT work (and either was really, really good or terrible, never any in between) or some guy who did sales but knew how a computer worked got roped into doing all the IT stuff. And naturally that got old fast for a lot of these small businesses so my name worked its way around this subset, giving me a nice base to start my own business.

I had this one company. Let's just call it Fastone's Inc. and I actually have no idea what they did.  The only billing I saw them do was simply called ""professional services"" and I was only in the office long enough to fix whatever brought me there. Always thought to this day it could have been one of the CIA front companies you hear about occasionally. But, anyway....on to the story.

And as always, no matter how you brand your business, no matter what you put on your promotional material, and no matter what name appears on your driver's license, when you are doing IT consulting, you will always be The IT Guy.

**The Internet is Broken Again!**

That is the entirety of the ticket that just came in. But I know this user and company all too well. Fixing this issue has become something of a weekly occurrence. But, for me, instead of an annoyance that means at least a consistent billable hour (and the client doesn't seem to mind paying it).

I give the user a quick call and try to walk them through a few basic troubleshooting steps. I know this is probably all for not as this guy has the tech skills of a caveman, but figured I would give it a shot and justify a visit. And after a frustrating ten minutes, all of that fails, so it is off to the client. (Billing for travel time and mileage now!)

**""I need you to reboot the internet!""**

I'm greeted with this brash statement as I enter the user's office.

""Well I can't actually reboot the internet, that would be beyond what...."" as I trail off realizing there is no need to explain anything to this guy.

""I have no idea why the internet just goes out every single week! But it always works after you do whatever to it, so just have at it!"" the caveman guy says getting up from his desk. ""I'm getting lunch.""

So I have half an hour to get this guy back online and maybe figure out more of a permanent fix. A reboot gets him back online and after checking a few places looks like maybe the network adapter is out of date, so upgrade that. Otherwise, everything looks fine. Trace back the cable to the network closet and appears to be good. Tone up the termination in his office and it is good. I'm not seeing anything readily apparent on why this guy is just losing network connectivity, but every time a good old fashion reboot seems to fix it. Maybe the driver will fix it this time for good....

**""Is there anyway I can just dial in and reboot the internet when this happens?""**

What an absurd ask I think to myself when he first asks the question, but you know what on second though I think I can automate the solution to this problem.

""YES!,"" I respond. It will take some programming but I can make that happen.

""Good. Do it. I'll tell the boss I OK'd the hours.""

""OK. Tonight I am going to set it up so if you dial extension 896 on your phone and follow the instructions on the voice prompt it will reboot the internet for you.""

""Hey that is awesome. I'll let you know if it works.""

**That Night....**

I remote into the company's PBX and set up an IVR for extension 896 (which is currently empty). Then place simple voice recording on it to play when dial. Basically it said ""The internet will reboot in 30 seconds. Save all your documents. Go to the start menu. Choose Shut Down. Wait until you hear the tone and then turn back on your computer. When your workstation is back up and running the internet should have successfully rebooted."" Then I added a simple beep to play after the voice recording and set the IVR to disconnect.

Done and done. Let's see what happens.....popcorn time....

**The Next Day....**

""Hey IT Guy! It worked!"" the caveman user wrote to me in an email. ""My internet went down, I dialed the extension, followed the instructions, and it worked!""

""Thanks IT Guy.""

(And to the best of my knowledge, that user used that extension religiously for the next 3-4 years until the company mysteriously disappeared one day ghosting me on my bill too...)",44,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF85B160>
551,Wherein Boss learned why the Exchange Admin uses test accounts...,"Semi-long time lurker, first time actually posting. (I think. I've slept since then.)

So this has been a pretty busy three weeks here at \[RedactedCo\];  Due to Outside Meddling that would have cost the place rather a lot of money(1), we had to make a few emergency changes to the way things work, like  enabling MFA for the Exchange's  web client, killing TLS 1.0, and other assorted shenanigans.

Things finally settled down from a chorus of screams to a dull ""oh, I guess I need this now"" requests in the ticketing system, and %Boss decided that now was the BEST TIME EVAR to migrate thier mailbox from the on-prem exchange servers to the Office 327(2) environment that I've not have any time to even look at the  instructions for fully configuring it for hybrid mode for our specific setup(3), let alone try anything approaching configuration with the various bits n bobs that make up our Kinder egg that we call the email system.

That was monday afternoon.  Yesterday around... oh, 2 or 3 pm local time, one of the other IT managers pings me with ""hey, I'm getting bounce messages trying to forward emails to your boss- what did you do?""

My response was ""Well, I didn't do anything, but %Boss sure did!"" and I got to spend the rest of the afternoon figuring out how to 'off-board' their mailbox back to the on-prem servers. That resulted in me discovering that we needed to tweak a couple settings with how EWS is configured for authentication, and I figured that it was all sorted.

It was, more or less,  But the boss still couldn't get their voicemail back up and running, because the thing that handles Unified Messaging either a) still depends on TLS 1.0 being enabled on the nodes, or b) still depends on older, broken cipher suites being enabled. (or both. Both is good.)

And so the production DAG nodes got their third or fourth rolling reboot in the span of two weeks, I've declared a freeze on any non-Microsoft published emergency patches(4), and I'm seriously considering revoking the boss's admin access to the exchange environment.(5)

&#x200B;

1. The amount of money between not implementing said changes and implementing the changes was something like six digits, with the first being over 5.
2. Yes, I know it's office 365, but I like randomizing the number because how stable has it been in the last 12 months? And the product name is supposed to represent the amount of uptime it's supposed to have?
3. It's an unholy mixture of Exchange, Cisco Call Manager, and a couple F5 BIP-IP LTMs, with Exchange's Unified Messaging taking over for Cisco Unity, because it's cheaper by a great deal of money. I think.  Jury's still out on that one...
4. And maybe even not then, unless the CVSS on it is over 8.5 AND some miscreant is hammering away at our systems with it.
5. Seriously- My plan this week WAS going to be to get  some honest work done with planning part of my big project this year done, but nooooo, people have to break their shit...",30,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF85B1C0>
552,The Case of the Missing Server,"You all thought I was going to leave you hanging there, didn't you? Don't worry The IT Guy would never do that to a bunch of strangers on the internet.

So, [just to review](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/qswp9j/how_did_you_get_this_number_you_realize_you_are/), the guy who was supposed to be on call got fired Monday morning for failing, officially, performance issues, but unofficial, because he was a jerk too many times. I show up to a round of ""high fives"" because people think I advocated for getting the guy fired, when it was instead the site manager who had a beef with him. Doesn't really matter now. It looks like actually no one who currently works there actually likes the guy and it is like I just landed a big giant house on the big bad Witch of the East. Whatever, I'll take it.

But, that leaves me, your friendly IT services consultant, still with a job to do....

""When can you deploy that server,"" the Site Manager throws at me in the late afternoon.

""As soon as you can find it....""

""Yeah, no one seems to know where it might have gone. Can you check the (fancy hardware location application - going to be vague with this one for corporate reasons) logs and see if it has any history?""

""Ummm, sure wasn't aware you had that kind of visibility on the equipment. Where can I get access?""

""I emailed corporate security to have them create you a login and you should be able to find the machine profile by doing a search for the asset tag.""

""OK...I've never used (or really even heard of this system) but I'm sure I can figure it out....""

""Yeah IT Guy I'm sure you can....""

**Location, Location, Location**

OK I've got to be a little vague here because what I will call an asset tracking system is FANCY and I don't want to even hint at anything that might touch a non-disclosure. I've never seen anything like it. Looks custom to a capital C and like someone high up at one point in time had some OCD about hardware, corporate espionage, or security, or something then threw a ton of money at a solution. Anyway, trust me. This thing is NICE.

So, just as the site manager said I get my login credentials, pop the asset tag into a query, and poof the whole profile is right there. Has a history of checking in on the internet and hey look there even GPS coordinates. This ought to be easy as long as the GPS is accurate...

""Hmmm....those coordinates aren't anywhere close to any of our offices...."" I think to myself.

Looking at Google Maps, it sends me to a residential section of town about 30 minutes away.

""That can't be right, I can see the delivery confirmation here in the profile. This isn't on the back of some truck still out for delivery....."" I continue thinking as I mull over the possibility.

The GPS location is solidly in a house, so I do a quick property tax record search to see who might be the owner of that address and \*poof\* it all makes sense.

""I'll be damned if this is right....""

The address comes back to one owner - Mr. I Got Fired This Morning.

Quickly I think my options are:

1. Call the Site Manager and tell him I think the server has been stolen
2. Call Corporate Security and make a report
3. Hey I have the guy's number from the weekend, I can just give him a call and see if he will give me the server.

Yeah I know I should have done option #1 or #2, but I'm feeling frisky for some reason. Figure might as well text him and give him a chance to give up the goods. Guy has already had a bad day, last thing he needs to do is catch a theft charge on top of it all. Maybe he had a legit reason why he took it home....

**""Hey This is the IT Guy...""**

So I start a text.

IT Guy: Hey, this is XXXXXX. You yelled at me this weekend when I called asking if you could help me locate a server. Security software is showing it at your house. If you have it for whatever reason just drop it back off at the office. All I want to do is get this thing in production tonight.

Jerk Guy: Fuck you. I don't have shit.

IT Guy: Fine by me. I'm going to report it to corporate security and the police.

Jerk Guy: Wait, wait.....I might have something but I didn't steal it. Had it to do some work and needed....(long, desperate explanation here)

IT Guy: Look, I don't care why you might have had it. I just need to have it and tonight. If it appears and everything looks good, I don't care how it shows up.

Jerk Guy: OK, so if I drop it off you are fine with this just going away.

IT Guy: Look I'm not going to lie if asked but in my mind all that people need to know is that the server has been properly installed.

Jerk Guy: I'll drop it off (location at side of building) after hours tonight.

(OK before you security guys jump all over me. The thing was going to get completely wiped anyhow and I made sure there was no tampering. This guy was not some kind of criminal mastermind looking to defraud the company. I think he just had an expensive piece of hardware and after getting axed probably was planning on keeping it.)

About two hours later.

Jerk Guy: Server is by the side door. I kept my part of the bargain, please keep yours.

**Sweet Irony**

In the end, the on call guy still found me the server and ended up personally delivering it. All that it cost him was his job (which was probably in doubt anyhow since he was a jerk). There was something wholly ironic (or maybe that isn't actually irony - Alanis Morissette anyone?) about him ultimately finding it for me. But, I digress....

Server was still in the box, sealed. I spent the next few hours getting it up and running. Emailed the site manager that night to tell him the job was done and was just going to leave it at that unless asked for further details. 

The next morning:

""That was some quick work IT Guy, where was the server?""

""I found it by the side door.""

""Huh....that is strange. Maybe one of the guys moved it thinking it was something else.""

""Yeah....who knows. Anyway job is done. What is in store for the rest of the week?""

""Thanks IT Guy. I've got a few more projects for you to tackle over here....""",108,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF85B220>
553,I need the hunt group you just deleted,"This has been an ongoing issue, so the long short is that we installed a phone system for a client a few years ago but the thing was installed by an engineer who quit for greener pastures without much documentation on what he had in mind midway through and kinda left us and the client in the lurch. So for the past few months I've been point on this phone system (since i'm basically the break/fix phone guy at work) trying to get the pieces put back. We had a ticket come in last week from $Bob their new IT guy to go over some of the phone system things and re do some of their hunt groups to better align with their location setup.

Sadly what $Bob doesn't realize (which is fine it is what he pays me for) is that you can have groups that are in a hunt group without giving them a hunt pilot, ie you can group extension 100-140 in a group without needing to have 199 to call them directly. However that being said there are some groups that they need direct lines for , ie 199 being for ""Region X Sales Managers"" but are not directly exposed to the public via DID.

Anyway $Bob and I had a meeting last week about their hunt group setup and after sending him a list of the Hunt Pilots, their descriptions, and the extensions associated with those groups he asks me to remove 4 of them. Me, being me make a backup as I know something will bork. Boy was I correct, about 3 days later we get a new ticket in that makes it way up to me.

$Tier1: hey Tyr4774, can you look at ticket 654321? $User says calls are no longer coming in when you call their number of 555.123.4567. They said it worked until last week sometime$Me: Ok I'll take a look.

I  look through the configs and see that 555.123.4567 points to Hunt Pilot 555 for ""Sales group BFE"". le sigh, so i call up $Bob.

$Me: Hey $Bob, I need to recreate 555 as it is in use by ""Sales Group BFE""$Bob: Oh, i didn't know that they were using it! Yeah, recreate it

I recreate it and think nothing of it until today. I get a call from the primary operators saying that they can't find the number (internally) for ""Commercial Sales BFE -1"" and ""Commercial Sales Group BFE-2"" and people have been asking for them all morning. I once again look over my backups and see yup 444, and 445 had been removed per $Bob's request. So once again I call $Bob.

$Me: Hey $Bob, according to the operators we need to add back in 444, and 445 as people are asking to be routed there.$Bob: Huh, really? I didn't think we needed those. Ok, re-add them

Thankfully I had the backup configs to recreate these hunt groups but overall I wasted about 6 hours between all the meetings to remove and recreate these Hunt Groups. Some days you just need to send the liver on ahead to the bar.

554,Can I just go home?,"I work in a medical office. A majority of my users are great. They read and respond to my emails coherently. They accept correction well. I am one lucky sysadmin.

Then, there are the small handful of users that everyone knows. The ones that keep clicking on a frozen application. The ones that don't listen to any of the sounds that your flapping gums are making. The ones that make you wonder, ""How did you make it this far in life?""

That is where Amanda\* (names changed to protect the innocent until proven guilty) comes in. Amanda is one of our medical records ladies. She spends most of her time in our EMR scanning in paper records from various places. Don't get me started on the EMR. It's backwards, freezes every 5 minutes, and we have outgrown it.

Back to Amanda. She has been with the clinic forever. She has been there since they implemented the current EMR. Amanda calls my office and tells me she can't get into the EMR. Every password she uses isn't getting her in. So I take a look for her. She's locked out. It happens after 5 incorrect attempts. It happens. Normally, I'll unlock it, the user will type in their password and all is good in the world. Nope. Not Amanda. Still doesn't work. Locks herself out again. I reset her password. Give her the temporary and she is off to the races. We part ways.

This unfortunately did not last long. About 5 minutes later, Amanda calls back. ""I changed my password but, I still can't get in. I know I am typing it right."" Give me a second to tell you about our EMR's password policy. It pretty much can be anything. I don't think there is a complexity requirement.  What it does require is that your password has a maximum of 10 characters. Yes. I typed that right. Maximum. Not minimum. What is further frustrating is that when changing your password, It will only accept up to those 10 characters, any more and it chimes at you. Chimes don't help when you are in an office where most of the audio is turned down because it isn't needed. On top of that, the log in prompt will accept more than 10 characters to be typed into it. You may see where I am going with this.

Amanda should know this. She has been here forever. I go to her desk to unlock her account and watch her attempt to log in. I ask her if her password is over 10 characters. It starts dawning on her. I ask her to log in using only the first 10. It was successful. I ask her if she wants to change her password again. She says no. She is going to just use the first 10 and get over it. She just wants to go home at this point.",71,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF85B2E0>
555,How many USB ports?,"I work in IT, and even though I don't work for the help desk support unit itself (I work for a unit that troubleshoots and supports certain databases), we sometimes get the calls that should really go to the main help desk support, but if it's an easy fix, I'll just help the person out.

When the pandemic started, a lot of us employees were issued work laptops and set up to work from home.

During the summer, I received a call from a WFH user (an IT manager) who had keyboard trouble.

User:  my USB keyboard is not working with my laptop and it used to. My laptop keyboard and the ""touch thingy"" works, but I don't want to use those because I hate them.

Me: (laughs) I don't blame you, let's see what's going on. Is this the first time you've tried to use the keyboard?

User: no, it was working fine up until today.

Me: did you check to see if it is securely connected to the laptop?

User: yes of course. 

Me: what make and model laptop do you have?

User: such & such

Me: OK, that's the same as what I have, you have two USB ports available, have you tried connecting the keyboard to either USB port and neither of them work for the keyboard?

User: yup, that's correct. 

Me: ok let me check something out here. (Had user go thru some steps, etc, all seemed well, then...)

User: would my new headset & mic have anything to do with making my keyboard not work anymore?

Me: (absent mindedly) it shouldn't... wait, your headset is USB, correct?

User: what else would it be? (Nope, not gonna take the bait on that one...)

Me:  is your headset currently plugged into your laptop right now?

User: yes, I had a two-hour meeting this morning and my keyboard and mouse both worked just fine before the meeting and now the keyboard doesn't work at all. Mouse works.

(99% of the world population knows where this is going... everyone, except for this user) 

Me: if you have the mouse plugged into one USB port and you have your headset plugged into the other USB port, what is the keyboard plugged into?

User: Silence for about 15 or more seconds...

Me: are you still there? Did we get disconnected?

User: oh. 

Moral of the story: next time I get a call like this, esp if it's an IT manager who makes more than I do, I will have the user do something I read in a funny tech story from decades ago, about having the user grab the keyboard and it physically take 10 steps away from the laptop, and if the laptop doesn't come with the keyboard, that's a sure sign it wasn't plugged in.",43,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF85B340>
556,"Yes, I already did that.","This story happened last month but just getting some time to write it up now. 

Key players:

$Me = obviously Me

$ OU = older user

I get an email from $OU saying she can't print from the terminal server. 

$Me: Sometimes printers lose connection if you're logon gets disconnected. Try logging off and back in.

$OU: Did that, didn't fix it. 

$Me: Okay I will remote in and help you. 

I remoted into her computer, logged her off and had her log back in. Did a test print, and boom it worked. She thanked me and went on her print-happy way. I thought all was good until:

$OU: Printer stopped working again in the terminal server. Logged out and back in. Restarted, nothing  helps.

I am thinking, okay maybe there is something wrong and I got lucky last time. So I remote in and do all the troubleshooting steps. I deleted the printer, re-added it. Verified the printer was online, etc. Still wouldn't print at all. So, I just logged her out again and back in. Wouldn't you know, it worked again. I showed her how I did it, sent her a video of me doing it and a quick tutorial. She thanked me again and I thought it was the last of that. 

It was until she said it stopped working again a week later. 

$OU: Printer stopped. Don't tell me to logout, yes I already did that already. 

$Me: Okay let me do research.

In the mean time I queried her user to see her last logon time. It says 8:34 and I look at the clock, 10:41. This means she didn't logout and just disconnected from the server.

$Me : You didn't log out. Here is your logon time, that was two hours ago. Please logout 

$OU: How do I do that? 

$Me: Please refer to the video I sent you. 

$OU: Oh, I watched that but wasn't sure what it was I will try that now. 

$Me: Let me know if it works.

Waited about 15 minutes and I sent another email

$Me: All good?

$OU: Yes, logging out fixed it.

557,The nicest customer,"Back in the days, I had this one dude call and demand to speak to me personally every day when I worked for company X's helpdesk. He took *a lot* of strong medicine and did not even have a X product... but I figured out that he could not play vidya because he had the wrong TV HDMI input, so every day we did a few mins of small talk and fired up the gaming console, laughed together at something weird that had happened since yesterday, and I got a top review. The nicest customer I ever had refused to call the console maker or the TV manufacturer as ""they sucked"" and hung up, because he sounded so blitzed on benzos and painkillers... so we had a thing for years.

edit: typos

He was always super grateful when I reminded him what button to press on the remote and it was a pleasant ritual.

I hope that he is all right!",11,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF85B400>
558,The monitor arm conspiracies,"When working the public sector, there are often times when several departments scream ""not it!"" when it comes to hardware management. Computers, monitors, and printers are usually accounted for, but as for the accessories, their organization often resembles the holiday candy section at Walmart the day before Christmas.

As in, a mess nobody wants to wrangle. 

The other day I was asked to find a monitor support arm and mail it to Podunk, New Wisminnekota. The one who put in the ticket is known to be a persistent lady with her requests. I'll call her Jill.

I checked or back stock and a room the requestee stated some of their stock was in. After quadruple checking, I didn't find anything and told the relevant people.

However, Jill insisted that there must be a monitor arm somewhere in the unexplored bowels of the central office. She decides to send me to a forgotten basement storage room, a closet full of mostly annual reports from the 70s, and a room where a bored supervisor was eating their lunch. No monitor arms were located.

A week passes and Jill keeps emailing me asking for a status on locating her treasure. I states I couldn't find any and asking her department's tech coordinator didn't yield any. I was asked to then check a training lab nobody has been in since the Before Times. 

I go in and check, lo and behold, a few dusty monitor arms are hanging out behind an ancient monitor. I grab and get it mailed out. 

Jill was thrilled to to have finally found them. She asked where they were and I told her. 

""Oh, I think [Former employee] put them there. I think she retired and is now living somewhere warm! She left like 6 years ago!""

So these valued monitor arms were hiding in a room for 6 years after the central office moved into the current building, hidden away by a person who I didn't even know. 

Can't wait to see what happens when we took out new hardware to users next month.",22,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF85B460>
559,huge change to our infrastructure because why?,"Creative destruction certainly has its place in things, heck I've used it myself a time or two.  But the old adage, ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it"", also has its place in the tool kit.  Anyway, back in the mists of time, I was in charge of a small tech support group for an academic department at a public university.

I had inherited a pretty cool set up, lots of automation for server and desktop maintenance, a desktop cloning set up that was pretty sweet and scalable, a ton of documentation on how everything worked which made training new employees fairly easy, anyway it was a pretty solid setup.   Not perfect, and always needing incremental upgrades, but it was pretty robust and it worked.

Then the powers that be decided things needed to be shaken up.  One of the faculty had some grant funding to hire someone part time for his research, database stuff IIRC.  The person they hired would also be working with my group part time, which would make him a full time employee.  New Guy (ng) was pretty smart but very much liked doing things his way.  He had a skill set geared towards a different Linux distro than the one we used and he started advocating for us to change over.  

I had several discussions with him over the practicalities of this.  All our automation,cloning, and documentation would have to be rebuilt.  We would be undertaking a huge amount of work, at the end of which he would have an environment he was more comfortable in, and all the rest of us would be on learning curve to some extent.  Functionally, our set up would be more or less the same, not better or worse.   It seemed to me that this would involve a huge amount of work, potential outages, and for what?  

However NG had some faculty members that really liked him.  He was the new broom, I was the old stick-in-the-mud.  So I had to be very careful when handling this situation.  I didn't bad mouth his ideas in public, tried to say things like ""interesting idea, we need to look at it"".   Then hopefully no one would follow up and I could forget it.   But NG had the bit between his teeth and scheduled a meeting with my group and ""interested faculty"".   He made up handouts to give everyone describing his vision and reasons why it would be better.  My co-worker and I were very careful not to be negative when the agenda came up.  We were mildly positive, or neutral.   But I was concerned since I REALLY didn't want to change.  I got the distinct impression the NG was using this job to build his resume and would not be around long.  

Finally the day arrived and we all marched into a conference room to hear NG's presentation.   He did a pretty good job, had slides, the whole enchilada.   I just sat quietly and listened attentively.   Finally NG wrapped up and took questions from the various professors who had come.    Then one of the professors asked me what I thought.   I had been thinking about my response and while I wanted to say it was one of the stupidest ideas I'd ever heard, I very calmly replied that I was sure we could do all this conversion, but I was concerned about loss of our automation tools and the requirement to either build new ones or modify the old ones.  

Another professor asked me to explain and I walked through how we managed things, version control, automation, replication/cloning, we had it down pat.   I could spin up a server from cold iron in minutes.   Need to install ten new Linux desktops?   Let me get them out of the box I can image them as fast as our network will allow.   I wasn't really being critical of NG, just pointing out that switching distros was going to be less than half the project.   

I was more or less holding my breath and I could tell my co worker (who felt the same as me) was also on the edge of his seat.  There were two professors in the meeting that were very system oriented, they knew what it meant to run the plethora of services we did, it wasn't a magic black box to them.

One of them, my boss, mildly stated that seemed that switching would not be worth the effort.   Another professor, who I was more worried about since he really liked new stuff and ideas, chimed in that he agreed.   The cost of conversion was not worth the effort.  

NG took it pretty well and co worker and I went out to lunch and marveled about how we had dodged a huge bullet.   

NG shortly got involved in a campus wide IT project which he found very frustrating since the other folks involved wouldn't do what he suggested.   In fact he mostly alienated the other folks involved but he would come back from meetings and tell me that those other folks might get fired for obstructing things.   

NG ended up leaving not too long after that, leaving me a handful of servers running his favorite distro, which I converted to our standard image as soon as I could.",56,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF85B4C0>
560,Rule no. 100000000000: Why backups are important. I learnt it the hard way,"Greetings to the wonderful folks at tales from tech support. Long time lurker in this sub, the below incident occurred about three days back (am still recovering from it:) . TLDR: Password for new keepass database does not work, all old backups deleted. Screw up of giant proportions, old database recovered and things are back to normal.

Usual disclaimers: English is not my first language, so please excuse any slip ups. Please revert back to me if you face any problems. A thousand apologies:).

I have a portable version of KeePass (a single .kdbx database with a key file) set up like this (it will be important later):

1. Computer has only the database file.
2. Two pendrives have both the database file and key file.

So, whenever I need to access the database, one pen drive is plugged into the computer for the key file (pen drive plugged into the android phone directly, using the OTG cable), the password is copy/pasted as needed, pen drive is unplugged safely.

A few days back, I tried accessing the database in a Linux VM, using Keepass XC and it kept throwing a warning message that the key file was outdated etc. So, I went ahead and changed the key file to the newer format (.keyx). So far, so good. While changing the password, Keepass threw up a message saying that the password was weak (it's about 20 characters long) and asked me whether I should continue/I wanted to change it, etc.

I ignored the message, but then thought: why not change the password to say something like 64 characters? (A small note here: I have been using the same master password for years safely).

Here is where things got f@cked up big time. I changed the password and key file, everything was working great ( I copy/pasted the 64 character password, FYI). Wow! Awesome! Works fine.

Then, the goof up: I will never know where exactly I messed up (not even willing to experiment at this point). I deleted the old databases in both the pen drives and overwrote the files. Now, the database was the same in all three places, with the new key file. Then tried opening the database. The dreaded error message ""Failed to load the specified file. The master key is invalid. Make sure that the master key is correct and try it again"" came up.

Even then, I was calm, of course, I must have copy/pasted it incorrectly and tried it again (in all three devices). The damn thing kept throwing up the error message (tried typing the password, nope not working).

I literally stopped breathing and went into full blown panic mode. This database had ALL the passwords: Banks, Demat account, mutual funds, crypto wallet....EVERY DAMN PASSWORD and USERNAME that I and my family use (It also stored the passwords of my wife's bank and stuff).

I was on the floor, begging to the Gods, whatever forces were out there, to help me out. My wife was unaware of all this drama. To add to the agony, I had used the Eraser software to securely delete the older databases/keyfiles from the pen drives (Even though I was able to access the older database in the computer using ""the restore previous version option"" in windows 10, without the old keyfile, it was useless). Was there no way out of this mess?About 20 minutes must have passed on and I think I must have lost about 10 years of my life at that point. If a writer had been present in my room, I guess he/she would have described me like this: "".....he had a look of horror, tinged with sadness on his face. All his efforts were in vain"". That was me at that moment. My wife, did step in briefly to discuss something and noted that my face was ""different"" (I had to pretend very hard to keep a cool face. Thankfully, our five year old kid stepped in at this point and both of them left the room).

I knew that there were data recovery services out there, but before that, I wanted to try to retrieve the files myself. A quick google search, led me to wonder share file recovery and while the software did show the missing files, it said that I needed to pay an amount to get the full version. Okay, let's try one more time before going for a paid solution. I downloaded Kernel data recovery, which showed the missing files and asked whether these could be recovered (they have a 1 GB file limit, which can be recovered for free).

This was the moment: Would the database and key file work properly? Was it corrupted? All kinds of thoughts were running in my head. The Gods, perhaps thought that I had learnt a good lesson and mercifully, everything worked perfectly as I was able to recover the files. I double checked and found that all the usernames and passwords were there, in perfect condition.  I let out a sigh of relief, which I am sure would have been heard in the entire universe. At this point, the ""Ode to Joy"" was playing in my head continuously.

Okay, freeidiot40x2, you messed up and now, you've got another lifeline. No more adventures. Before doing these stunts, I had discussed about the password change with my wife (both of us know the master password) and she had warned me not to go ahead with it. She felt that 64 characters were too long. Of course, when has any man obeyed the sane advice of his wife? /s.

Her point of view was very simple (and sensible): The old master password has been safe enough (using it for nearly 3 odd years), I don't backup using any cloud service, the usernames and passwords have not been used in external machines, all stuff is stored locally and under our control, we take all precautions, no matter which device we use keepass on (Windows 10 and Android mostly). I believe this stuff is known as: If it ain't broke, don't fix it.

So, lots of lessons learnt here (most of it is obvious stuff). One: no matter how old you are/how much of an ""expert"" you think are, there is a huge possibility that you will screw up. Two: Never delete old backups, they could save the day (I discovered an old keepass backup in an external drive, but this dated back to 2018 and was downright useless). Three: Even if a file is ""securely"" deleted, it can be recovered. Four: For the love of God, **please do not delete any backups until you are dead sure.** Double check, triple check whether all stuff works fine before deleting them (even then, keep a copy of the old database safely). I could go on, but you get the point. Oh and test your backups, once a week or so. Thanks for pointing that out, u/XkF21WNJ. Last thing anyone needs is the backup file being corrupt.

PS: Writing about this stuff, triggered the unpleasant memories. Sorry for the long rant, if you've made it this far, great. Thank you for taking the time to read this completely. Have a wonderful day and hopefully, you folks did not mess up this badly when it comes to backups.

Edit: Thank you for the awards, folks. A few quick updates:

1. Initially, I had both the key file and database in the computer also. A few months ago, against my better judgement, removed the key file from the computer and retained it in the pen drive. Bad move. Of course, here it was also plain stupidity on my part to erase the older backups. The (previous) master password consisted of about 21 characters.
2. Maybe this sounds very dramatic, the whole incident traumatized me and now, I have gone back to using the old password itself. It's not a perfect measure, a password change is long overdue. Thank you all for your wonderful suggestions regarding a stronger password. As a first step, I have started creating time stamped backups in 3 of the pen drives and  2 of the external drives and of course, the computer. It's not perfect.  The strategy will have to be fine tuned.
3. I do not trust any cloud with personally sensitive data (too much of paranoia, I guess) , but it looks like a cloud backup would have been of great help and spared me much agony in this instance. Perhaps, something like an encrypted zip file of the database with a strong password or using software like cryptomator/veracrypt (for secure cloud backups) should do the trick. The password for such a cloud backup would be written on a piece of paper and stored in a bank locker/a trustworthy secure place.
4. Someone pointed out that a properly configured eraser software would be make it hard to recover the files. I double checked and the eraser software I am referring to, is this one: [https://eraser.heidi.ie/](https://eraser.heidi.ie/). It is setup with the erase option ""Gutmann"" 35 passes. I guess that the option ""US DoD 5220.22-M"" (3 or 7 passes) is a better option.

In this case, I wouldn't blame Keepass, the fault was entirely mine. It's a fine piece of software, which I have been using for over 5 years, without any problem.",101,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF85B520>
561,I think this printer is magic,"Background I work in a small local computer shop which does a bit of everything and a lady brought a printer in for the second time after the previous week it was jamming. Likely the paper as it seemed very thin and cheap likely recycled as it was yellowish.
We came to the conclusion it was something to do with the way the printer was picking up the cheap paper as standard A4 allowed the printer to work reliably again.
The second week it has been brought in again. Why because they are back with the weird thin paper the printer jams with. So having delt with it the previous week. I took the paper out put standard in and it printed reliably. So I put the customer's paper in the scanner. The weird stuff begins when they pick it up. Note they where not charged.

OL: old lady OH: old husband M: me

M: We got the printer working again **showing test prints** and it seems to be the recycled paper doesn't get picked up well by the printer.

OL: You must be mistaken I am using Morrisons paper not recycled paper. I took all that out last week.

M: Well it seems you left some in the paper tray as it was still in when we got it.

OL: No I removed it all.

M: Alright perhaps you missed a few sheets *it was not a few just trying to be polite* I put it in the scanner so that you may use it at home for jotting stuff down.

OL: It wasn't in the paper tray I **with  the focus being on the I** put it in the scanner there was no paper in the tray.

M: Uh...

OH: must have been magic dear.

The look the old lady gave him almost sent me over the edge cause it was such a confused but also angry face and clearly the old husband wanted out cause he rather quickly took the printer to their car.",18,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF85B580>
562,"""How am I supposed to know that?"" Look here. ""Oh I don't look there.""","Today has been a wonderful day so far! I have worn the wrong shoes so I can't walk anywhere without getting a reprimand, I wasn't able to get coffee, and am the only tech working today for my several hundred person company! Living the dream :) Here's a quick one that I thought was ""fun"".

I had just gotten off a 30 minute call trying to get a user into a bank system that simply doesn't work thanks to a bad update from our vendor, and through no lack of trying we had to just give up. Not in the best of moods after struggling and failing for half an hour. I was given a 5 second breather before the next call came in from someone asking for a quick password reset. EZPZ this is a nice change of pace.

$user: Hey I'm locked out of this, it just keeps saying ""Cannot Sign on"".

$me: **(it does say that when you're locked so makes sense so far)** Sure thing I've unlocked you, can you try again?

$user: Getting the same thing.

$me: Want a reset?

$user: I guess if you have to.

I reset her password, it still doesn't work, so at this point I know either she's the worst at typing or something's up.

$me: Hopping into your computer.

$user: Finally, thank you.

I try to type it in, and I get the same thing, so it's not user error from typing. Good to know. I immediately poke around and see that she has the icon pinned to her taskbar, which we warn them not to do since it's not actually an application, it's a website that launches an application, and gets updates when it reaches the website. Dumb I know, but we work with what we got. So if there's an update, that pinned icon will stop working, cause they're pinning the local app, *not* the website. Wouldn't ya know it, there *was* an update from the 2017 system to the 2020 system. 9 MONTHS AGO. So this person, who makes more in bonuses than I do in a year, hasn't logged into our main banking system in at least 9 months, possibly longer.

$me: So I see the issue, you're launching from this pin on the taskbar right?

$user: Yeah that's what I always do.

$me: Gotcha, well there was an update a few **(read: more than a few)** months ago to the 2020 system. This link was to the 2017 system so that's why it wasn't letting you login.

$user: **(She got a bit flustered here)** Well....I...how am I supposed to login?

$me: Well, we recommended to everyone to use the shortcuts provided on the desktop so that way the updates run when the program gets launched, rather than Pinning the application itself.

$user: But I use, the pins. How am I supposed to know that there was an update?

$me: Look here on the desktop, it says **Blah Blah 2020.** Your link says **Blah Blah 2017**. 

$user: Well I don't look there.

$me: The desktop?

$user: Yeah I just look at the pins.

$me: ...can you try to login now for me?

Queue the user then spending the next 5 minutes trying to setup a password and me continually telling her that the ""new"" **(again, read: not new)** passwords have to be 15 characters.

$user: I hope you know that NO ONE is going to remember these stupid long passwords.

I internally die as literally the entire company uses these passwords, which we didn't even set the requirements for.

$me: Yep they're long. Have a great one!

565,"Endless scanning project, well, you're the boss","This is another story from my days in a University computer support group, dealing with my boss's boss.  I referred to him in the past as $bigboss, so he'll be $bb for this story.

Many years ago $bb got it into his head that he'd like to post pdfs of a whole bunch of old papers he had written or co-written on his webpage.  No problem you say, totally makes sense.  However, he had no electronic copies, only the actual paper copies, and he wanted me to scan them for him. 

The problem for me was I had NO access to bulk scanning.   This was before the days of every copier having scanning ability, and we didn't even have a desktop scanner.  But he wanted it done, he was the boss, so I dove in.  

 I did have requests from some students for a scanner, and I had access to some funding that was reserved for student equipment, so I figured I could buy an inexpensive desktop scanner with a sheet feeder and ""borrow"" it for a couple of days while I had a student scan the hundreds of pages that needed to be scanned.

All the papers were bound in various types of non permanent binding so they had to taken apart, scanned, then put back together, so the process was going to take a while.  There were dozens of these documents.   And to make things interesting they were printed on A4 paper, so we had to make sure we didn't get a scanner that couldn't deal with that fact.  

So, I bought a scanner, did some test scans myself, seemed OK, showed one of my student employees what was needed, and went back to my real job.   At the time my group was down two members so I was handling way more work than normal and relying on my students a lot. 

We got several of the documents scanned, I took a quick look and then copied them into $bb's directory and emailed him to please review and see if they were acceptable.  He said they were so I told my student to go to town.  We got everything scanned over several days (obviously my student wasn't available eight hours per day, far from it).   He got the documents all rebound and delivered back to $bb, and I figured, we were done.

But I was wrong.  Within a couple of days $bb was back with a couple of issues.   The scanner I had bought fed the source pages from the top or bottom of the page, not the side (long edge), and the pages were two sided.  So the pages got pulled into the scanner over the glass, scanned, then flipped, scanned, ejected and the next page pulled in.  The problem was that the pages tended to be scanned slightly off on vertical alignment so if you were viewing a document in a pdf viewer every other page seemed to ""lean"" slightly away from the previous page.  I don't know if this was because of the non-US paper size or not but $bb didn't like the way it looked.  Frankly I hadn't noticed when I did my quick proof.  

Another issue $bb brought up was that some pages, especially those with graphs or diagrams were very faint compared to the pages with pure text.  I went back to the source documents and found the originals had the SAME issue.  It seemed to be that we were going to have to scan each page by hand, edit for brightness or contrast, then merge everything into separate pdfs.   

I suggested to $bb that this was really a project that should be outsourced to someone who actually did this kind of thing as a profession, but no, $bb thought that would be too expensive.  I don't know how many hours I had invested at this point but I got $bb to realize that there was no way I could do this for him in any reasonable time frame, without letting my main duties completely go.  

A day or so later I had what I thought was a brilliant idea.   I rushed to $bb's office to tell my cool solution.   I knew $bb traveled a lot.  He typically spent summers outside the U.S. frequently in up and coming third world countries.   Why not take the original documents with him on one of these trips, and find a local person or business who could transcribe the documents into some standard electronic format?  It could be done for a fraction of what it would cost in the U.S.  It would be providing work for someone who likely needed it.  Diagrams and graphs could be scanned separately, it was a win-win.

I'll never forget $bb's response to my idea.   After getting me to mess around with this project for weeks, at a time when I was doing the work of three people, he just waved my idea aside and shook his head.   The documents ""just weren't that important"".   I walked away wondering just how important my time was to him.",114,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF85B700>
566,Monday morning fun... New users,"Someone suggested I post this here

 

Firstly  we have a shared mailbox for ITS support emails. We also have a mail  address that goes directly into our ticketing system, but that doesn't  work for external domain emails. Those automatically drop in the shared  mailbox. Also: my work related emails have a standard signature block.  Thanks, MistressDodo, ITS helpdesk Coordinator.

This morning (monday) I had the following email exchange:

Initial email to helpdesk :

>*Hi,*  
*I  am a new staffmember in group xxxxxxx and am wanting to set up a  computer and login. Let me know the process to get this underway.*

My reply:

>*Hi,*  
*When  you start you will go through the on-boarding process with HR. You get a  check list and one of the items is to come to IT to get your  username/password for your account.*

They answered:

>*Hi,*  
*This  is the process I am currently following as today is my start date. I  have the checklist with me and will bring it along. How do I go about  contacting I.T directly as this was the contact I was given to set up  the account.*

I replied:

>*You have contacted IT directly….?? Your account is ready to go, you just need to drop by to collect the details.*

Their answer:

>*I  have not contacted I.T directly as this was the only contact I was  given. I can come to level y and see if the details have been already  set up for me.*

My answer:

>*Just  to point out You Have Contacted IT Directly – we just have a shared  mailbox to make sure someone being away doesn’t impact the  response-times.*  
*We have your account ready and you can collect it at your earliest convenience.*  
*We are located building x level y behind the lifts*.

She  was just here to collect her account and was quite indignant that  someone “dared” to setup an account without her input. I pointed out  that HR knew when she was starting and they let us know so we could have  things ready on her start date. Her answer? “Well that is a weird thing  to do”",44,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF85B760>
567,"My modem dont need power if the ""Wireless Thing"" is powered on.","Hey everyone, so good to be posting again, it has been a while. My previous posts in this subreddit were pretty popular, so I was happy that I could entertain you all. 

As stated before, I am a local PC repair guy in my area and most of my customers are by word of mouth. I got this call one morning from a repeat customer. I probably hear from her about 2-3 times per month. 

So, it is around mid-morning, I get the call. I answer with my usual greeting. (No clue what that greeting is, however; I am sure it was clever and somewhat charming) LOL

The caller right away and what sounded to be like she was in a panic, tells me that she has a “Major Problem” and tells me that her internet service is out. I respond and tell her; I am sorry to hear this and tell her that the local ISP (Small Town) may just have an outage. Being on the same ISP and sitting in front of my PC, I checked mine and it was working ok. I tell her this info and she says, “Well that’s weird can you do me a favor and remote into my computer to see what’s going on?” 

Of course, in my head I am laughing, and of course this made me go silent. She asks If I am there. I say, Yes I am sorry, and then proceed to tell her that if her internet is not working I cannot get into her PC. She seemed confused and said, “Oh, I thought you said your internet is working?” 

Of course at this point, I am not annoyed or anything as I do understand that some people, especially a little older like this customer, really do not understand the concept of all of this. 

I try to explain to her that my internet is working but for remote connection to work, that both sides would have to have internet. Still confused, she says, “Yeah but I don’t understand, you remotely work on my computer when its broken all of the time.” I of course spent more time trying to explain the whole thing to her, but decided to start going through troubleshooting with her. 

Long story short, I start at the 1st point, look at your modem, tell me if you see lights on. (Its cable internet) 

She then says, “Well none of those lights are on but do they have to be?” I responded, telling her that yes, they need to be on because of they aren’t then that may mean the modem has no power. She then say’s, “Well the lights are off because I unplugged the modem but it should be ok because I left the “Wireless” box plugged in. She was meaning the router. I set her up with a modem and a separate router back in the day. 

Curious, I asked her why she unplugged the modem. She said she felt like there was too much plugged in, in tat corner and she assure me it’s not the problem because the “Wireless box” is still powered and she backs this up as proof by telling me she knows its ok because she can still see her network name on “Wireless.” LOL

So, I explain to her how the modem works in harmony with the “Wireless Box” and both have to be plugged in. Initially she tells me that she does not think I am right about this but ate her words when the internet started working again once she plugged the modem back in. 

Did not charge her since this was an easy fix. 

&#x200B;

TL;DR - Customer calls with report of internet outage. I find out the modem is unplugged (She had too much plugged in) but she insists this means nothing because her wireless router (Which she calls the wireless box) is powered on.",118,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF85B7C0>
568,I now know how Nero felt.,"Year is 2019. I had been at small MSP for 3 years now and things were going gang busters. Picked up numerous clients, installed some big hardware, grown from 2 people on the Service Desk to 8. Things were overall just going great.

There was this one customer that was really being hard to work with. Finance Officers wouldn't respond to emails, invoices were going 3 months into delinquency, you know the kind I'm sure.

So our CEO went to them, told them he was willing to help them through the obviously hard financial time they were having. Gave them a payment plan. Made it clear that we held all the chips and they needed to play ball with us. We had their domain name, their Microsoft licensing, the whole shebang.

Every week or so I would approach the CEO with a huge smile.

""C'mon CEO, I have always wanted to see how quickly everything goes to shit when I start turning things off.""

""Yes yes Hittingman, I'm aware of your constant need to burn down our customers services."" with an even bigger, some would say cheeky smile.

A few more months go on and it just stops. No payments. No emails, nothing. I jump into our finance software and at this point they are $60k in the hole.

""Please, CEO, it's time.""

""Give them a week.""

A week passes, two even but no sign. Eventually I look up to a knock on my office door.

""It's time Hittingman, you have my permission to terminate their servers. You should have just gotten a ticket from me to do so.""

The look on my face must have been something to behold because suddenly all my team members are coming in to watch the fire works.

First I divert their phone number to a voicemail and suspend all of their Office Phone Services. In a couple of minutes I get a notification that the voicemail is full so I crank it right up to 100GB from 150MB.

I remove all the Microsoft Licensing from their Office 365 account. I start seeing all of the machines start to through up activation errors and exchange logon errors for mailbox does not exist. It's beautiful.

I then delete their name servers for their DNS. They just disappear from the internet over the course of the 4 hours most of the TTL of the addresses had. I can see our warning alert emails are now bouncing back.

Lastly I turn off their UTM. They had never paid for this years license so it was running in a repeated 30 day trial mode so no harm no foul.

I see the general manager's mobile appear in the call centre queue. I park it and notify the CEO that it is coming through. He wants it directly to him. In the three years I'd been there nothing ever went to the CEO directly, always through the PA. I didn't even know CEO had an extension number.

""3000 Hittingman, if you could make sure that I am not disturbed for a while""

I forwarded the call and fell back into my chair utterly satisfied. I looked at my mess of monitors with pings all returning nothing and a steadily growing voicemail box.

Company went bankrupt a few weeks later, we managed to get the UTM back but that was about it. I wouldn't say that my experience was worth $60k but it was certainly worth something.

TL;DR -

Boss let me turn off troublesome customer. It was fun. The end.",178,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF85B820>
569,Office Downgrade - Don't shoot the messenger.,"I got requests for more stories about user after this [one](https://old.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/qsfvkx/my_mouse_is_missing_some_one_took_it/) This user was neurotic and paranoid that the business hated her and wanted her gone.

Me: me User: user

This was around 2009 at the time of the great recession. The business decided that it didn't need 2 offices and planned on moving all of the secondary office into our office. To be honest I don't know why they didn't do this already there were plenty of cubicles spaces. I guess not enough offices and that's where our story begins.

It was well known that the owner, CEOS high level executives etc would all have an office and that if you weren't one of those your office was available if needed. User's office was available. I am sure there was some sort of heated argument between user and her boss about this and she probably demanded to keep her office and she be put at the bottom of the office availability list. Her boss was coming from the second office and had no authority here. All of this prior to where I come in.

My boss comes to me and says HR just called and wants you to move user from her office to a designated a cubicle. It seemed kind of immediate like it needed to be done right away so I left to go do it right away. I walk in to the office of user.

Me: ready? As I say it I look around and realize the office is not packed but didn't think much of it. Maybe she wanted to move her non-IT stuff later. User: looks at me huh? Before I can say anything about the move User: OH NO NO NO NO NO I AM NOT FUCKING GOING ANYWHERE. I ALREADY SAID I CAN'T AND SO&SO(her boss) SAID SO.

Me: I know your not yelling at me. I was told from my boss and HR to move you. I am doing my job. Take it up with them. User: WELL I CAN'T DO MINE LIKE THIS! DON'T TOUCH ANY OF MY STUFF. I walk back to the IT area, she flies over to the HR\Executives area. I hear her from the other side of the office area screaming bloody murder and bringing up my name in a negative fashion. I tell my boss what occurred and he called HR. I am brought in minutes later so that her boss my boss HR ETC are all there. She is now crying and the impression I get is that she was reprimanded. The HR lady who is the sweetest person in the world has this look of angry and disbelief like I she never saw anything like this before. Her boss was saying things like ""I don't know why your being like this and I told you I would try and make sure you keep your office but its not guaranteed. I forget the whole conversation but I told them what happen and that I was not happy. They said ok you can go. I get a call from HR later apologizing and saying we will let you know when she is not in her office so you can move her stuff. I moved it and that was it. Over the next few days I did hear her complaining about her setup being slightly off and I heard her coworker had to help her move tons of documents ETC from her office to her now packed cubicle. I heard whispers around the office like ""this is what happens if you don't keep up the times"" Like the fact that she didn't want to move to a cubicle because she couldn't fit all her documents in it. All could of been avoided if she learned to scan files instead of printing and storing. Old school mentality. She rarely contacted IT for anything after that and when she did it was through her boss and if I had to deal with her directly she was forced fake nice.

570,A Dropped Blackberry,"Before becoming an IT manager, before qualifying as an IT architect, before becoming Service Desk Lead, your author was a standard ol' Service Desk Engineer.

Everyone has their ""best tale"". You probably do. Mine was from 2012 and a chap called in about his BlackBerry Curve 9300. The Curve 9300 was a quite unlovely replacement for the Pearl, and replaced the ball with an annoying tiny touchpad thing, but they had 3G and could do WiFi hotspot for free, which endeared them to us even as the bigwigs were getting iPhones and Androids.

Anyhow, this guy had dropped his BlackBerry. I asked about the damage, mostly to check if I needed to advise about a punctured battery, he said he didn't know.

Wait...what? Okay, what's it look like?

He didn't know.

What was he doing when he dropped it?

""I was 45 metres up a tower doing an insulation inspection."" (A ""tower"" is what the layman calls an electricity pylon, but strictly only the arms are pylons)

Ah. That'll do it.

571,IT Support does not want to do IT Support things,"The company I work for feels like heaven compared to some of the companies I hear about here, so this little story is probably not as interesting, but it did put a smile one my face.

&#x200B;

I receive a ticket asking us to create Jira accounts for two users.

I could do this manually, but a couple months back someone made an active directory group that automates the process, only IT Support has permissions to manage this AD.

I´ve done a couple of these but this time I just thought hey, there is a quicker and easier way for someone else to do this, why should I bother with it.

So I reassign the ticket to IT support with a comment ""Please add the user to Jira-XX-Access group as we lack the neccessary permissions to do so""

Two minutes later, the ticket comes back.  
Of course, I expected this to happen, so I assign it back to IT Support with another comment:

""As I mentioned below, we do not have sufficient permisions to add this role to the users, which is why I am reassigning the ticket to your group.""

One minute later, ticket comes back again, this time with a comment from IT support:

""Passing the incident to XX-L3 as per the exception list.""

Okay, now I am amused that someone just refuses to do a task that takes two minutes because it is supposed to be on their exception list, even though it is a task handled by their department but I still refuse to budge, so I send a request email to the IT Support mail adress, which creates a new ticket for them, not five minutes later I get an email notification: 

""Your incident INCXXX has been resolved: AD - Add users to Groups""

572,"""How Did You Get This Number??!!!"" - ""You Realize You Are 'On Call' Right?""","Despite almost doubling my rates for new clients (and that rate was not bargain basement either to begin with) the work keeps on coming in. I know this wave isn't going to last forever, so am taking full advantage of the shortage in the labor market while I can do so.

This means an average work week for me in around 70-80 hours, but again, I'm getting paid by the hour so I don't really care it is pretty much sleep, eat, work, repeat. I'm starting to feel like Scrooge McDuck and his money bin with the good times rolling. I just need to make sure to put enough away so when the bottom falls out of the this labor market and the leads dry up, I've got enough to go lean on for awhile.

Anyway, here is a quick one that I just experienced. Enjoy.

**The Scene**

**""**Hey IT Guy! When can you get to that new server we were talking about???"" the manager screamed over at me while I was tending to a network issue across the cubicle farm.

""Yeah, it is going to be sometime here..."" I say looking at him annoyed.

""Well, I need it up by the weekend if possible. Feel free to do any of the work at night if that helps.""

""Actually it does....I might have some time this weekend...Who is my technical contact after hours""

""Great. We really need that up by Monday. If you have any hangups just ping the on-call tech. They are usually around on the weekends anyhow...""

**Saturday Night**

I remember when I used to have a social life and hated it when a job took me for weekend work. But, that seems like ancient history here approaching year two of a pandemic. Now a Saturday night is just like any other evening. This one though I was about four cups of coffee in and knew sleep was not in the cards. So over to my client's office I go to finally tackle that server I had been promising him.

Should be a 4-5 hour job to get it into production. Nothing special here. Just decommission the old one. Restore a backup. Optimize some stuff. And boom I should be done. Home by midnight. Client will be happy and I'll get a few more hours to bill this week.

First things first, I show up and go to the location where the server was supposed to be. It is just gone. I look around in all the usual places - nothing. Check the not so typical places where some of the in house guys will put stuff - nothing. Hmm....stumped but not wanting to go home, I remember there is an on call tech. I look through my email and see the announcement about who it is this weekend and give his number a call.

Rings through to voicemail. Sounds like a personal phone number, so I leave a message. Call back time says one hour or less in the protocol so I hunker down doing some odd tasks waiting for the return call.

An hour later I don't have a call, so I ring the number again. Once more through to voicemail. I leave another message asking if this is not the right person to please let me know, but I have a job that needs to be finished tonight so give me a call back ASAP.

**""How Did You Get This Number!!!!!""**

I went to the bathroom and left my cell phone on a desk. When I come back there are 5 missed calls. Thinking something is wrong I page through the call logs to see it is the same number 5 times in a row in about 7 minutes. Hmmm....so I give it a call back thinking it might be the on call tech.

Firs thing out the mouth of the guy who answers - ""How Did You Get This Number!!!!!""

""Ummm....."" taken aback.... ""You called me five times in a row just now....""

""No I didn't....."" ""Put me on your do not call list!""

""Hey look you called me figured it might be a return call for XXXXX company, I'm a contractor doing some work tonight....""

""You just can't go calling people in the middle of the night because you want to work!""

""Ummm according to the office email you are the on-call tech....""

""I told my boss I don't do call anymore!""

""Well, tell that to the office admin who put down your name.....""

The guy is clearly really annoyed and this is a new client. I don't want to get a bad reputation, so I just try to make nice, but he would have none of it.

""You contractors are all the same...."" blah blah blah as he dumped on contractors for five minutes.

""Look guy I just need to know where the server might be. Someone moved it today and I would really like to just get it up tonight....""

""This isn't why we have an on call person on the weekends. It is for emergencies only and you wanting to work ungodly hours on a Saturday night is not my emergency!""

At this point in time, I just want an exit strategy.

""OK got it. I'll just let my contact know that we couldn't locate the machine and see what he wants to do on Monday...""

""Got that right bud. Don't call me again unless there is an actual emergency!"" Click.

**Emailing the Boss**

As a consultant I know it is best to keep EVERYTHING in writing if at all possible So I start an email to my contact who is the site manager:

""Hey Manager Guy - I was at XXXXXX company just now to get that server deployed and the physical machine is missing. I contacted the on call tech (if you remember you told me to reach out to them with any problems) to see if they had any insight into its location. Unfortunately, the interaction I had with him was less than positive and I don't think I'll be able to locate the server to get it up by this weekend. Let's talk on Monday. Sincerely - IT Guy.""

Figured that was about a diplomatic as I could put it even though I was mildly annoyed to have wasted at least 2-3 hours that night with the whole drama.

I didn't hear back for the rest of the weekend, but figured he might just be waiting until he saw me on Monday morning.

**Monday Bloody Monday**

Turns out the site manager didn't email me because he was livid at the on call tech. He and that guy had a history of duking it out over on call assignments and other office related politics. So, the manager was taking full advantage of this situation and set up the tech to be fired Monday morning.

Apparently it was ""fireworks"" galore, but unfortunately I got there about 15 minutes after a few tables got flipped and the police had to be called. And also apparently everyone hated this guy for a long time (I wouldn't know why.....). Word got out that the tech was sacked mostly because I ""complained"" about him. Now I have people coming up to me thanking me profusely for getting rid of the guy like I actually fired him.

It was an odd way to curry favor with a new client, but hey if it gets me more work I'll take it. Also the random people treating me like some sort of hero, seeking me out to say ""Thank you IT Guy"" is icing on the cake.",450,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF85B9A0>
573,"Oh, 18 hours is too short notice? How about 4?","Hi there. As they say: long time lurker, first time poster. I never really though I would have anything worth sharing here, as most of my experiences with foolish users or customers have generally been fairly mundane. And to be sure, even today's experience pales in comparison to many of the stories I have enjoyed here. But at long last, I think I finally have something at  least worth ranting about.

For context, I work in application support for some specialized enterprise software. I don't actually spend a whole lot of time interfacing directly with end-users, but rather with the designated contacts at the client businesses who use our software. And as I'm sure you all know, some of those business seem to remain in operation in spite of themselves (you know the sort, cut corners on their own hardware, hire incompetent staff who can't find the start button without help).

So at about 4pm EST, a ticket comes in from this customer. They want after-hours support from us to work with them when they plan to reboot server of theirs which needs to communicate with our software. When do they want to do this? Tomorrow (Saturday) morning. By SLA we require AT LEAST one full business day notice for a request like that, and because of the time difference (most of the group that I work with is in Europe), all of the people who would be involved in such a thing ended their work day hours earlier. And that's what I told the customer, asking them to postpone the reboot until it can be properly coordinated with our team.

So what do they do? At 6:30 EST, they submit a new ticket with the same request but for a new time. And surely that new time must be for some night next week, or even the next weekend, right? Oh no, most certainly not. Now they want to schedule it for 10:30 PM - TONIGHT!!!!

My shift ended at 6pm, and I only even saw the stupid ticket because I was finishing some emails to help them out with their *actual* problem that I spent all afternoon working on. F\* 'em.

574,One isn't the loneliest number,"I was working for a small company, whose bread and butter was online retail sales. Onboard Raid died on the sole physical web server the website ran on. Replacement board had about a three-week lead time… Dept. Head recommended replacing the server, but even then, the store would be down for a week or two, and we’d have to get a $Vendor to setup their proprietary software; This in itself would have been expensive. As the owner is flipping his shit, I peeked at the server and notice it just had two hard drives, and thought to myself ""There's no way it would be this easy"". I plugged the drive into a regular SATA port, turned it on, and the server booted right on up, web server and all. We got super lucky that the server was running Raid1, and that the stars aligned with the soft raid. I got a bunch of atta-boys, and I recommended right then and there that we just replace the server since it was already about 5 years old at that point anyway.

Two years later I get called in early because the very same server, that was left as is, had failed to come back up after a reboot. By the time I got there the owner and Dept. head are arguing about whose fault it was between them that the server had never been replaced, and they ask me if there’s anything I can do. By that point I was aware that all the important bits of the E-commerce site, including the db, were hosted on a different server. I popped open the case, moved the cable from the bad drive to the second drive that hadn’t been touched for two years, powered it back up, and everything worked fine… Other than being more then two years behind on updates.  More atta-boys were given, and the server was replaced within a month after that.

TLDR: Cheap small business got extremely lucky twice with hardware failures.

575,My mouse is missing!!! Some one took it!!!,"Happen about 12 years go. Just some setup. Most of the workstations had a wired mouse. I handled workstation setups for the most part. This user was very neurotic and thought the company and her bosses were always out to get her or get her in trouble or get her fired. 

Me = me User = user

Boss gets a frantic call from user. 

User: My mouse is missing! ::incoherent ranting about workstation::

Boss immediately transfers call to me because its ""user"" and something about her mouse and workstation. I pick up and she is screaming.

User: Why is my mouse gone! What you didn't have one and so&so (her boss(s)) told you to just take mine cause I'm disposable right? You have no right to just come in my office and take my mouse! I'm going to HR! 

At first I couldn't understand her over the screaming so I said flat out: 

Me: I am going to hang up if you don't stop screaming and calmly explain what's going on.
User: My mouse is gone!"" Did you take it and give it to someone else?!?!
Me: No I didn't take it. We have plenty in the back. Ill bring you a new one. 

I walk in to her office and can feel the piss-mist. She radiating anger.

User: SOME ONE TOOK IT! This is ridiculous. I can't work and people are fucking with me. 

I see no mouse on her desk so with a new mouse in my hand I look under her desk at the workstation and see multiple things plugged in to her desktop. Since I set these up I know the workstation has 6 ports 2 in front and 4 in back and I know 1 for keyboard 1 for mouse and in some rare cases 1 for a scanner. So I see 3/4 in the back used and the 2 in the front empty. I also noticed the wires are loose and messy and I keep them tidy with Velcro wraps during setup.

I look at the top of her desk again and all the way back behind her monitor in the dark dust coated area of her desk is the mouse. It looked like her foot had snagged the mouse wire down below and pulled it so that the mouse flung all the way to the back of her desk. So I grab the mouse and pulled it deliberately slow towards her and the front of the desk and place it down.

The look on her face to this day I will never forget. She probably lost years of her life being that stressed and angry. She was now angry but in a ""I'm stupid"" way. I just walked out immediately and went right to my boss and explained everything and to make sure HR knows the real story. We had a good laugh about it.

577,Another side of tech support,"TL/DR at the Bottom:

The company I work for has a service/lease agreement with the company I physically work at.  Every 3-4 years the Laptops/Desktops get replaced with newer equipment when the lease is up and our group usually has to track them down if they aren't in their assigned locations.  Usually policy is that if laptops are left on desks they need to be secured via cable lock to the desk, but desktops being more bulky this isn't the policy.

I get tasked with trying to locate and swap out a device one day and finally come across it on a desk near, but not exactly where it should be.  Unhooking all the peripherals I notice someone attached a cable lock to the desktop, so I have to contact the on site security team to unlock the cable lock, which usually isn't an issue but of course I was in a hurry this day so it was a calamity in it's own.  Conversation goes a little like: SG(security guard), Me, RM(random manager).

SG arrives 30 minutes after making the request for assistance (typical)

SG: ""Did you call for assistance with a cable lock?""

Me: ""Sure did.""

SG: ""Is this your computer?""

Me: ""It's my companies, yes.  I just need to swap it out with this other one I have here.""

SG: ""Who sits at this desk?""(pointing to empty desk with PC on it)

Me: ""I'm not sure, I just know that this device is past due to be replaced and that's why I'm here.""

SG: ""Well I need the permission of the person that sits here for you to take the machine.""

Me: ""It doesn't belong to whoever sits here, this device belongs to my company (shows him the work order with the computer ID of the one that is on the desk and the one that I'm trying to swap it out with) I just need you to unlock the cable lock so I can put this one here and then I'll secure the new one if that really makes a difference, though it shouldn't have been locked in the first place.""

SG: ""Well all the devices should be secured to the desks.""

Me: ""That's never been the policy for desktops, but I just need this unlocked.""

SG: ""I'm going to need a manager of this area to approve that this device is ok to take.""

Me: \*sigh\* ""I don't know where any managers are for this area, I don't work for *comapnyname* I work for *othercompany* and have other things I need to get done today as well.""

SG: \*walks off to find a company manager\*

RM/SG *returns*

RM: ""What's going on now?""

Me: ""I work for *othercompany (point to security badge with othercompany name)* I need to swap this machine out, it's past its replacement date (show paperwork again).""

SG: ""I need to know who sits at this desk to make sure this guy can take the machine.""

RM ""This is a 1st shift worker desk and he's not here now, but what do you need them for?  This guy(me) has the paperwork for the exchange.""

SG: ""Ok, I didn't want to get in trouble handing a device over to the wrong person......."" (looks at key ring) ""Oh I don't have the right key to unlock that cable lock, I have to call my supervisor to bring the other set of keys.""  *15 minutes later supervisor shows up with the keys and unlocks the device.*

A simple 15-20 minute task is now taking over an hour and a half because of stupidity, and the security guard mentioned that he was retired law enforcement for the state at some point during this which just makes it even more aggravating.

&#x200B;

TL/DR: Over cautious security guard makes my life more difficult by not understanding the business relationship between mine and his company even with proper paperwork and credentials being shown.

&#x200B;

EDIT: To clarify some security points that have been brought up in the comments.  The site I work on is a secure site.  You can't just walk onto the campus, you either have to go through one of those overlapping metal turnstiles with a RFID reader or drive onto the campus through guarded gates that require you to scan your badge and be verified by a member of security.

I'm not saying it is impossible to steal anything from the site, but the lengths an ""agent"" would have to go through to counterfeit the credentials isn't worth a random employees computer, which all the files are on shared network locations.  There are multiple buildings and 100's if not 1000's of employees most of which don't have offices.

In order to get a member of security to show up to a location you have to call a dispatch line, provide credentials and the location security is to meet you at, as well as verify your information when the security guard shows up with a picture badge with the ""sites"" logo and your vendor information visible.",34,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF85BB80>
578,I Need a New Mouse!,"I feel like this post will fit in the spirit of this sub, but if it doesn't quite qualify as tech support, I will remove.

Backstory: Once upon a time I worked at a big box electronics store (not the blue one, but fairly Micro by comparison). Technically retail, but we were expected by the customers to be free tech support. One day, I came upon a lady amongst the wireless mice looking confused and holding a ziploc baggie containing a wireless mouse.

Cast:
Sweet (but clueless) customer: SC
Me: M

M: Hello, can I help you find anything?

SC: Yes, I need a new mouse, this one doesn't work. *gestures to bag*

M: *noticing it looks like a relatively new basic logitech* Hmm, that's odd, those tend to be mostly reliable and it looks new, perhaps the battery has come unseated?

SC: No, no, I need one of these *pointing to a trackball mouse*

M: Oh, you prefer a trackball! We have a few options...

SC: No, one with one of THESE *leans in closer to point at the USB dongle*

M: *assuming she can't find the dongle hidden in the battery compartment* Ah, I see. This mouse does have one of those, its in...

SC: I found it and plugged it in, but it still doesn't work. 

M: Hmm, that's odd. Did you get any message or hear a noise from your computer when you plugged it in?

SC: I think it doesn't work because it's just paper.

M: I'm sorry?

SC: *opens baggie to show me that she had painstakingly carved out the cardboard image of the USB dongle from the original mouse's packaging*

M: *silence as I try VERY hard not to laugh* Um....may I? *she hands me the mouse, I open the battery compartment and show her the actual dongle*

SC: *goes beet red* Oh........thank you very much.....

579,"It's got a plug on it, it's IT's responsibility.","Well, for me, it is. I deal with much of the hardware issues in IT, but i also do the PAT testing for devices brought on site. So essentially, i **AM** responsible for [anything with a plug on it](https://www.reddit.com/r/iiiiiiitttttttttttt/comments/jtledd/on_todays_episode_of_its_got_a_plug_on_it_so_its/)

And so today's story starts with a timid user

>""Do you do PAT testing here?"" says a user.

>""Yes sure, what your na-"" *door slams*. And in a puff of unsociability, the user disappears, leaving behind a solitary heat gun.

So i open the box, it's brand new. The box falls apart though, spilling cheap chinese accessories all over the floor. ""Good start..."" i think to myself.

I give it a good check over. ""Right fuse, cable looks good, moulded plug, so no dodgy wiring to worry about..., lets plug it into the tester...""

*PAT testery clicky noises*

*Whirry fan noises from the heat gun*

***BANG*** A plume of blue smoke erupts from the tip of the heat gun, and it ceases to whirr.

>""Well, shit.""

I just happened to have some other photography related equipment to bring down to the same department the heat gun came from, so i loaded up the trolley and plodded down, trying to make sure not to smash the 3D printer going to the dept next door didn't get smashed up on the door frames on the way down.

>""Here's your photography projector, and i'm sorry to break it to you, but the new heat gun literally exploded whilst i was testing it, so it's failed.""

580,"Other students at the school, where I was taking a computer class, couldn't turn a specific computer on.","At a vocational school, I was taking a computer science class, and occasionally the computer nerds were called out ( why hire an IT when you're training like 20 of them? ) to fix other school computers. It's not plugged into power, the display cable is unhooked, the good ole' turn it off and back on, or maybe the computer is crashing, because it's full of saw dust.

One day, we get a call from the nursing class, that one of their computers won't turn on. The teacher let's us just go check it out, ourselves. I go with another guy, I'll call Phil. The nursing teacher directs us to the computer in question, and explains how it's not working, trying to turn the monitor on ( an old CRT in the 2010s; yes, we were a poor school ). I look under the desk to actually turn the computer on, and I regret not saying what I just now thought to say.

I wish I'd said, ""Well, I can tell you now that this computer isn't the problem... because there's no computer here."" Instead, it was something even more basic, like, ""Ah, I see, there's nothing here.""

Phil and I, both, tried to contain our grins.

Indeed, the VGA cable for the display was just hanging behind the desk. The teacher and students were just turning this CRT off and on again... at least they learned something from us. That still brings more questions, though. Where's the computer? Who sits here? Did somebody take it to their desk without actually swapping? Did someone steal an entire desktop? But most importantly: Do they think they're turning the computers off when they leave, but it's actually just the monitors? Have these computers been running all day, every day?

All the other students, and the computer class teacher, found it amusing, but we never found out what happened to the computer. I didn't, at least. We did lose a computer from the comp sci class, at one point, though... MY computer.

582,Haunted Computers,"Today's on-site visit reminded me of an older story of mine. I don't think I've told the second one on here before. Here's both stories:

Part 1 - I got called out to an office today because the capslock was working backwards. I remoted in and watched the problem occur, turned off all of those pesky accessibility options to no avail, before deciding to head out with a new keyboard. Upon arrival, I found out that the laptop in question wasn't using an external keyboard - even though there was a keyboard tray under the desk with a keyboard... and a book... and a stethoscope on top of it. I unplugged that keyboard and her problems went away. I offered to sprinkle some holy water on things but they didn't want to pay extra for the whole exorcism...

Part 2 - The flashback - as I left their office, I was mentally transported back in time several years ago to a hair salon. They kept complaining that their Macs were losing internet randomly during the day. For 6 months we labored on this. We replaced the router and added new Wi-Fi access points. If Wi-Fi radiation was ionizing, they would all have brain cancer - the coverage was that good. I had constant connectivity monitoring going on so when they would complain, I could jump on and see what dropped where - except nothing ever did. And by the time I got by their shop, everything was always working fine. I finally started randomly dropping in, hoping to catch the gremlin unawares.

And I did. One afternoon, as I popped in, a gal said ""hey! It's happening!"" I quickly rushed to the bathroom and changed into my Superman Underoos and then flew, clumsily, to the front desk. It was happening!

Hmm - Wi-Fi shows good. I can still pibg the computer. All access points are up. Why can't I left-click on anything? That's weird. I can right-click... That's weirder... I plug a corded mouse in - same issues. I manage to get the Bluetooth menu open - a lot of stuff in there. I turn off Bluetooth - everything works! Except that the Mac next to me begins to exhibit the same issues... The mystery deepens...

After lots of sleuthing, I finally decided that there had to be another mouse in this building. I began digging through the front counter - nothing. Back office - nothing. Owner's office - nothing. The girls were snickering at my Superman Underoos - I ignored them - they wouldn't know fashion if it bit them. I finally told the owner my suspicion and she casually mentions, ""oh, I've got some old mice in the bottom of my purse.""

Now, I may be dressed as a Tech Superman, but I'm not going through a woman's purse. Especially a woman who looks like she could ""femininely"" bench press me several times without breaking a sweat. She retrieved the mice and I confirmed that they were the Evil Rogue Mice Twins. They would sit in the bottom of her purse waiting to be set down just right so that they could click, wake up, and connect to the unsuspecting computer. I took their batteries out and banished them.

Edit - to clear up confusion - the mice weren't actually causing the wifi to go down. When the rogue mouse would get stuck in a left click, the user couldn't click on anything and they were interpreting that as the wifi being down (see! I click on the link and nothing happens!)",18,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF85BD60>
583,Lady doesn't trust me to remote into the computer I built and assigned to get,"Top edit: title should read ""to her"" and not ""to get""



Quick backstory here: I work in the physical therapy industry and am part of a team supporting around 1,300 individual clinics. Each clinic we support is part of our company; we aren't third party in any way. We either own these clinics or are in a partnership of some kind

 We buy laptops and desktops and configure them before shipping them out to new users and clinics. Part of our configuration is installing log me in and another remote access software. 

So I'm working here for about six months and I get a call from a receptionist lady that I'll refer to as RL. The conversation goes as such...

Me: [company name] help desk, this is me.

RL: Uh hello? My computer isn't working

Me: I see, is the computer turning on? What is the issue with it?

RL: It turns in but I don't know what's wrong, can you fix it?

Me: No problem I should be able to help. Let me take a look, what's the identification number so I can start a remote session?

RL: It is most certainly a problem. I don't know who you are and I can't just let you into my computer!

Me: I'm sorry I'm just trying to trouble shoot what the problem may be and I can't get a good idea of that over the phone.

RL: Well you can't connect to my computer, I don't trust you. I need to speak with my manager about this

At this point im a little frustrated but trying to stay professional and not blurt it ""Lady, this is our computer, I can connect any time I please"". She puts me on hold for about fifteen minutes while she speaks to the clinic director; I'll reference them as CD. CD picks up the phone

CD: Hello? This is [their name]

Me: Hello, my apologies for any confusion. I was helping RL with an issue she was having in her computer and she was worried about me connecting to her computer.

CD: You need to fix it right? Go ahead and remote into it, I'll talk to RL about it.

Turns out that CD was shocked at his receptionists attitude towards me and ended up apologizing for it. I fix the issue and go about my day and a couple days later I see a termination notice come in for RL; my boss and I had a good laugh about it

For context I've worked at this place for over two years now and I can count on one hand how many people have been rude or hostile towards me",119,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF85BDC0>
584,The day I got Joe,"I'm not sure if this fits here since it's only sort of tech support, but here goes...

This story takes place around 2005, about 15 years before I started actually working in IT.  At the time I was a department lead in one of the processing plants for a large photography company.  My department was responsible for very basic retouching of pictures in Photoshop using Wacom tablets, entry level stuff that doesn’t require any previous experience.  I had a 70+ year old guy in my department who basically only worked there to keep busy after retiring from his real career.  We’ll call him Joe.  

While Joe wasn’t a computer tech, he was very comfortable with computers and knew a TON about Photoshop.  I learned a lot from him over the years.  Joe also had a great sense of humor and was the type of person who could talk circles around anyone he met.  When he chose to poke fun at someone, which he did often, they usually didn’t even know he was joking around with them until several minutes later because he was so quick on his feet.  All this meant that it was extremely satisfying that one time I actually got the better of Joe!

I was always the go-to guy to fix computer issues in my department and the several departments that were near mine when people didn't want to open a ticket.  One day Joe calls me over and says he’s having trouble with his Wacom tablet.  

Joe: Hey, every time I try to use the healing brush it just leaves this big white smear instead.

Me: Oh, I’ve seen this before, I know exactly how to fix it.  This is going to sound weird, but just bear with me.

Joe: Ok…

Me: First, set down the stylus and stand up.

He sets the stylus down on his desk and stands up, expecting me to sit down and take over. Instead I take a step back.

Me: Ok, now here’s the weird part.  I want you to turn around in a full circle until you’re facing the computer again. Trust me, this always works.

He gives me this incredulous look, like I’ve lost my mind.  But he goes along with it.

Me: Perfect, now sit back down and try again.

Joe: But you didn’t do anything!

Me: Just try it.  Like I said, this always works.

He proceeds to pick up the stylus, try again, and when it works he looks at me like I just pulled a rabbit out of his ear.  That’s when I tell him he was holding the stylus upside down and when he sat back down and picked it up he was holding it correctly that time.  In Photoshop if you hold the Wacom stylus upside down it automatically uses the eraser tool instead of whatever tool you have selected.  I know for a fact that Joe knew this, since he’s the one that taught it to me, but that day it just didn’t dawn on him for whatever reason.

587,An eternal grudge over the simplest of errors,"$DC = Me
$Phyllis: the lady who trains people on 
the circuit board in question
$Cam = another coworker, basically an ""extra""
in this story

I used to work at a place that made circuit 
boards and modules for industrial automation
and monitoring. I tested newly-made boards,
and troubleshot any failures. I would do simple
through-hole resolders, and send surface
mount jobs to the ""surgeons"" who could
deal with the surface mount resoldering or
part replacements.

I was testing a board which had analog and digital I/O,
which had it's own microcontroller chip.
We tested that board with a test fixture that
was connected to the desktop computer.
Essentially the test fixture provided all the
necessary voltages, and simulated inputs
on command from the computer's test software.

At this point I had been working with the set
for about a week. The test software throws
an error that says ""could not communicate
with the board being tested"" so I look closely
at the board itself for visible defects in
specific areas that would prevent the board
from powering up or communicating.
Not finding anything, I try again. Same error.
So I set this one aside and try another board
to see if the issue was with our setup, or the
actual board itself. Same error. 

Okay, definitely a test fixture or computer issue.
Of course, I look to the coworker, $Phyllis, who showed
me how to do these boards but she is busy
discussing something with another person.
So, I go ahead and try the first thing we have
all learned to do first when troubleshooting 
any application: close and reopen the application itself. 
Upon reopening, it apparently doesn't ""remember""
which file it had open, but that's not a big deal.
I look in the most obvious places including the
network disk we have our test instructions in, along
with files that are necessary for testing or programming
a given board. Looking up the part number
for the board, or it's actual name in words, 
does yield a folder and test instructions,
but no test file/program, and the test
instructions for the technician don't mention
where the file should be. 

So, I go over to $Phyllis and her coworker to 
ask her to come help ""when she has a minute""
and she immediately asks what I need, and I
ask where the test program file is, because I
had to reset the software and it didn't 
reopen the file. She was rather snappy
when she asked why i didn't just go and get
her rather than messing with the computer.
I said, because you were talking to someone.
Then she's like ""it doesn't matter, just let me
know if you have a problem, there's no point
messing with it when I'm around""
Instead of arguing with $Phyllis, I take out
my notebook with the intent to write down
the location of the file so I can find it again.

What I failed to look for is a ""recent files"" list
but that wasn't in a menu with a name
that was obvious to someone not familiar
with that software. Naturally, that's what 
$Phyllis used to reopen the test program.
However, she did it too fast for most people
to follow what she was doing.
I did see where it was, but
just in case the ""recent files"" thing didn't work
due to some glitch, or the program got updated
by engineering to a newer version, I asked 
where the actual file would be, with my 
notebook in hand so she knew that it was for
future reference if the problem needed fixing
again in the future. 
Of course, $Phyllis just said to just come 
back and ask her for help if the software
has any trouble again. Not wanting to 
make a big deal about it and turn it into
an argument, I just let it go.

About 5 months later, $Phyllis is training
$Cam on the same circuit board. When she
gets to the point of discussing the actual
test software, she brings up the time that
$DC tried to fix a failure to communicate
by restarting the test program itself. 

Although it's not evident from the story, it
literally took less than a minute for $Phyllis
to reopen the file and it took basically no
additional effort beyond that. And yet, somehow
she was still pissed at me about it, 5
months later. This post wouldn't have even been worth writing if it wasn't for that.

TL;DR: trainer holds an eternal grudge over
a generic troubleshooting attempt that
did no harm in the end.",22,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF85BF40>

589,The Devil is in the Local Area Network Details,"Hello, long time lurker first time poster.

Starring:

Me, LC - local contact

Background:

I work partially as a consultant in enterprise networking. Had a customer send in a support ticket as he'd spent some time troubleshooting because a pad and a voip system weren't connecting to the network. The LC had managed to troubleshoot the pad to some configurations on the switch and had solved this, but was unable throughout the couple of hours he had been working on this issue to get the voip to work.

Story time:

I get to LC's location before the morning coffee has graced my lips so the first half of our meeting is spent mostly deflecting from showing how unconscious I am by asking habitual troubleshooting questions. Other devices in the same room work, configuration is correct, the pad is functioning but no matter what, the voip device just won't power on. Oh, it needs PoE btw. Huh... 

By the time I get to see the switch everything is connected to, I'm barely capable of recognizing what the damn thing is let alone how to connect to it. I eventually get there after staring at the console port in the back for some 30 seconds and find no issues on the switch itself, no limitations, no capacity (2 ports of 24 in use) issues, just nothing.

Step 2 is to get to the room where the voip device is located. I flip the device to see where the ethernet cable is connected... The device has 2 ethernet ports. Huh2. I can see the tiny label on the empty ethernet port (the other one is being obscured by the cable): ""LAN IN"". Huh\_v.3.0. Several questions as to what has been troubleshot on the device itself followed. Well no troubleshooting was done exactly on it, cause the cable is stuck and there are no other lan ports available on the wall. Aha. Queue some 5 min of trying to jiggle, wiggle and coax the damn RJ45 out. No go? Rip it bayblade style (not recommended). That works, the cable comes out sans damage to itself or the device. The newly empty port where the cable was stuck is labeled ""LAN OUT"". Aha2. Plug cable into ""LAN IN"" port. Device comes online. Check to see if it calls, if the mic works, if the traffic goes out the building. Aha\_v.3.0.

Guy seemed fairly sheepish at what had happened. I comforted him that even the most hardened professionals make these types of mistakes sometimes. Cool dude all in all.

591,A wholesome story about helping my family,"This is still pretty fresh in my mind. This is how I learned that the best thing to know, is how to ask the right questions. 

It's officially been one full week since my brother died. Massive heart attack, I felt his pulse disappear. He was an avid photographer, known around our entire county, and an truly intelligent person. He was my family's ""tech guy"", a role that now falls to me, this is where I come in. Because he was such an avid photographer, my parents wanted access to his computers to try and pull some of the many thousands of pictures he's taken. But he didn't keep any of his passwords or hints in his safe. They asked me if I could try to get in, to avoid having to pull the drives and potentially lose something.

I went to work trying to find some way of breaking in and removing those passwords, eventually I found a way, which I will not be detailing here. All I will say is I managed to change some file names and got a method of changing the passwords of all accounts on the computer, as well as his laptop.

My parents nearly fell apart when I told them I'd managed to get in without disrupting any data whatsoever.

This entire ordeal has firmly planted a desire to engage in a profession within the IT field. I know from reading the stories here it won't all be sunshine and daisies, but if I can ever help another family like I was able to help mine, I want to try.

I apologize if this is poorly written, or maybe doesn't fit here, but I needed to tell it, to remind people, jobs in IT may be hell, but maybe the person on the other end of your line is going through the worst pain imaginable, losing a child that had so much promise.

592,Saved to local machine,"Fresh from today (it has not been a good day). Although long out of IT, you get known as ""the bloke who knows about computers"" and I'm used to it. Mostly.

A colleague came to my desk.  We'll call her Fran (to protect the guilty).

Background: we have a program we use where we access a server with files on it.  If you save the files locally, you're damned. Sadly you need management access to see where the file is saved to prevent people changing files down the line.  You're IT people. I obviously don't need to explain further. 

Fran: I've lost some scanning.  I can view it on ProgX but no-one else has access to it.

Me: Right, I'll need to come to your machine to find them.

The files were nowhere to be found on the local machine. I looked in the usual places, I scanned something to see where it was being saved to, I checked that she was logged in as herself at the time to see if it was in someone else's profile on the C:\

Fran: By the way, does it make a difference that I wasn't at my machine at the time.  I was using Phillipa's...?

593,Short and sweet,"Here's a quick one that made my day.  
Skip past the line if you don't want backstory

I work for an MSP which was acquired by a much larger MSP in recent years.

Our team has downsized quite a bit, people have moved, new people have joined, and as a result I've been a bit concerned that our overall service quality has dropped since the acquisition. We still exclusively service the clients that came with us, however.

We also have a non-profit charity client who you have probably heard of, and who's staff seem to consist of entirely pleasant people (shocking, I realize). They have been with us since before the acquisition, and continue to be a relatively large client.

---

Today we have a ticket to terminate a user at our non-profit, and who we have worked with relatively often. 

They called us today before they left to say: ""...this was the best tech support team she's ever worked with and we give fantastic service.""

I think I might have cried if I had taken that call.",17,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF85C1C0>
594,Is there a second-grader I could speak to?,"Obligatory first post, on mobile, etc.

Technically, I’m not Tech Support, but operate the printroom in a modest company, with some design/layout/creative work on occasion. Nevertheless, I think this story belongs here, at least in spirit.

I currently have one project that is next year’s calendar for a client; new photos, updated sponsor ads, and of course the actual calendar itself. (Thank you, InDesign plugin.)

One of the new logos is a bit… difficult; the client sent a PDF. A mid-low resolution scan of a business card. Slightly crooked, on an A4 page (similar to US letter, just longer and not as wide - make what jokes you will about *that*), and entirely unsuited for this use. So I e-mail the sponsor directly to ask if they have an actually usable version of the logo, rather than a scanned business card.

I receive a new file shortly; a new PDF… of the same card, only this time it’s crooked *and* upside down.

So I reply again, emphasizing that I need the logo as a proper image; a scan of the business card is useless to me.

I get a new response: a scan of the same card, slightly straighter, but still upside down.

It was at that point I conceded defeat and just used the first crappy version… ‘cause I know my boss would have been strongly disapproving (while laughing her butt off) if I actually asked the sponsor in question if they had a second-grader there I could speak to…

If there’s any update to the whole mess, I’ll probably post an update…",99,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF85C220>
595,Why you shouldn't use free trials in production,"It's been years since I last posted here. I guess we all end up coming back to IT, no matter how much we try to get away from it. Anyways, here's one from a few years back

It's a nice day in the office. We had recently been moved from in-house office space to WeWork and certainly appreciated the free coffee and the plentiful chairs. I was sipping my after lunch coffee (half and half) when my IM pinged

>$Analyst: Hey $Me how's it going? You got a second? I have an issue with this link, it should be loading <report> but it's not working anymore

>$Me: Yeah sure, let me take a look

So I click the link and it indeed doesn't work anymore. I thought, hey, someone probably messed up the permissions system, let's check it out. So I load the admin interface to look at it... and it's not loading either. Huh.

    >ping <server IP address>
    [...]
       Packets: Sent = 4, Received = 4, Lost = 0 (0% loss)

Ok so the server isn't down. That's... good? I decide to check if I can log into the DB engine, and it also works. Right, time to see if my boss knows what it might be.

>$Me: Hey boss, what's up? You know if we're having a general issue with the reporting tool? I can't access it.

Well, he'll take at least 20 minutes to reply, so I can go get some more coffe-*ping*

>$Boss: Hey $Me, uhhh turns out my predecessor left out a trial version installed and never actually requested to buy the license. It just ran out the 180 days trial period and it'll take at least a week to get a license bought. I'm gonna go down to the floor and try to rescue the report files, wanna give it a try too?

>$me: Can I get another coffee before getting on with it?

>$Boss: Sure, see you in the floor in 5

So after I got another coffee, I started to scour the server filesystem to find... nothing. Not a trace of the three hundred report files we had created since we started the tool migration six months ago. Perhaps more coffee wasn't good for the panic that's setting in now. Okay, just breathe and think about it.

After some Googling, it turned out the report files aren't actual files in a folder, but are stored within a table on the DB engine. Thankfully, the table was still there and accessible to my account, so after a couple hours of going down the rabbit hole of how the tables were structured, a few queries, and a PowerShell script (and some iterations of trial and error) I managed to recover the entire folder structure with report files and have everything ready to import to the other DB engine where IT had just finished installing the reporting tool server... which was also a trial license, but this time it was only until the order for the full license came through. At least nothing was lost... except the permissions for each report and folder, which did take us the better part of the following day to recreate.

But I didn't have to let my coffee grow cold, so that was a win I suppose",184,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF85C280>
596,"Anyway, I pressed Reset.","Found this sub yesterday, glad I can move away from the ComputerStupidities I keep reading and confess part of my days.

The guy left, and anyway I don't care about what he would say, so:

Lunch time, was at the refectory. That user came by and quietly told me ""Computer froze like five times, I pressed reset every time and now it doesn't boot"". I know this guy does not like working too long (as many out there), so if he tells me at midday then the machine was down since the early morning (or the yesterday evening).

No ticket yet and my lazy ass down, I went by after 1:30pm. Sure enough, booting leads to a black screen, not even a bios.

This machine was fairly recent : 2015, brand new PCI/ISA backplane (great!), a shiny parallel card (love it!), two frontal USB ports (awesome!) and \*\*even\*\* a motherboard with SATA support (incredible!) with a platine-plated SSD with its antivibration kit (what?) for our trusty Windows XP. Yes 'we' love dead technologies.

No way to boot this thing back, so I took one spare motherboard and started to change it on site (because this darn thing was really difficult to take out); this is the king of MB with jumpers everywhere and original ones were hot-glued, highly maintainable. Nope, does not work: BSOD on startup (thanks XP for keep rebooting while BSOD, had to google how to stop it).

\*User: So?

\*Me: Well, by resetting it looks like you finished the motherboard, and the hard drive too.

\*User: When this will be fixed? Because I'll need to tell it at the morning meeting.

\*Me: I think tomorrow morning.

I went to take the necessary tools to take off the PC and replace entirely with a spare because that was the easiest way before fixing the old ones, I found the maintenance coordinator and told him about the ""press reset to kill"" thing. He was pretty fine about the troubleshoot. I put the PC on the workbench and transferred the cards into the new machine and restored a backup into the new disk. Looks fine, went back home.

Tomorrow came. I had to take some pills so I was stoned; I usually don't really care about what peoples I don't like says, so it was even worst. I put the new machine and started plugging everything (all hail profibus, eight 9d-sub and many outdated things) when the guy went angry enough to yell at me.

\*User: Hey you told that was MY fault because I reset multiple times BUT I told you I reset ONLY ONE time and your job is repairing not blaming (insert angry noises).

A random guy which loves to blame everyone came to support his point. I was like ""yeah go for it, life's good"" anyway. For unknown reasons an another guy went into corpse elimination, they quickly calmed down when I started explaining everything I knew. I'm a fun guy I swear. 

Restored disk didn't work, so I took a look on the BSOD error and, for once, I found an answer: wrong bios config for reading the disk. Had to change something I don't remember, so the old disk was fine. I claimed it has dead anyway, no one would care. It came back to life.

Reconfigure the address of the parallel port to detect the dongle, yell on Windows because old COM ports were hidden so new config started at COM9 instead of COM2... Everything was working except the network (new MAC address).

Because I was done with this I directly asked to the high-level guy to make the emergency request for network declaration (I don't have access to that for.) and this \*\*emergency\*\* request took three days and like five calls to get resolved. Finally everything went back on.

Pfiou.

597,"System issues cause a single mother panic, I look deeper","Hey all! You all seemed to like my previous posts so here's hopefully another heart warmer for all my techies;So for some context I work in a broadband/TV/phone company in the technical department but I can also help on the billing side too to an extent.

A lady called in and immediately she didn't seem okay, she said we'd taken over £100 from her bank after she cancelled one of her services with her and that she was a single mother and no one had informed her we'd be taking that payment. Without that money she wouldn't be able to pay her bills, feed her kids or buy petrol for her car.

At first glance the account seemed to be right; she'd only had broadband for a few months with us so of course there would be a fee, but she insisted she'd been with us longer and she was right! I found emails about her service that the account didn't say she had that she wouldn't of gotten if she didn't have it! She shouldn't of had any cancellation fees as there was even an email saying she was no longer in contract! It was a big system error that had caused it, and within my scope of digging up information.

I told her while I could make no promises at this time, I was going to escalate it to my manager and we were going to see if there was anything we could do. She was understandably worried but I promised her I would call her back. Armed with all the details I sent it all to my manager. Within an hour we had a response from the higher ups;

Give her her money back

Also knowing she didn't have much money in the account and it could take a few days my manager and I agreed we should give her a voucher for a supermarket so she could feed her kids and use the money she did have for emergencies until the money came in which could be sent immediately. I called her up and told her what we were going to do and the poor woman was nearly in tears. She thanked me but I thanked her for calling us and giving me all the information I needed to help her and that she'd done the right thing to chase this.

Considering I had a very difficult call afterwards with another customer where I was sworn at and called 'a waste of space', I'm at least glad I managed to help her today.

598,Remote access doesn't work. And now it's broken too!,"Like many of you, I switched to remote work in 2019.  Unlike many of you, I had no idea how the heck to set that up... But hey, I was trapped at home with nothing better to do and getting paid to figure it out. It took a few days of research and cursing to cobble a system together, but in the end it worked. Most of the time. In fact it worked so ~~well~~ okay that my boss tasked me with setting everyone else up on it too. And that's when the problems started.

See, it just so happened my workplace and I had the same ISP, so it was very easy for our systems to communicate despite all the NAT involved. For everyone else I used some spare cycles on a VPS I was renting to relay all that traffic instead. Things worked great once I set that up. For everyone except Steve anyway...

For *months*, Steve made a point of telling me remote access didn't work for him any time we were both in earshot of our superiors. And every time I had the same response: ""Let me have a look at your laptop.""  But that laptop never came. I'm not going to lie, not only was I totally stumped by what the problem could be, I also stopped caring about it. Winter turned to spring, spring turned to summer and yet Steve's problem remained. 

One day I noticed an unusual charge on my credit card; I had forgotten to cancel the VPS I was renting. Steve and I were the only people who would be using it by that point, but I didn't need it and he kept telling me it didn't work anyway. So with a conscience whose cleanliness can only be the result of a faulty memory I cancelled that service.

24 hours later Steve tore into my office, frothing at the mouth. ""Remote access doesn't work anymore! It's totally broken!""

""Yeah, yeah, I know... You, me, laptop, et cetera.""

""No, it *did* work, but now it's totally broken and I can't do my work now!""

My ears immediately perked up and I did my best to project a halo of innocence round my head once I realized *why* it'd stopped working.  ""I'm quite certain you told me it didn't work at all...""

""Just the one thing! Everything else was fine!""

""Ohhh?""

600,Fun with phone lines,"So, yesterday's fun: I was in the office taking care of a few things (new switches for a remote office mostly) and I was asked to look at a phone line. Specifically the phone line used by the alarm system.

The alarm company says the line doesn't work and they can only connect over the LTE backup. This has been an ongoing issue.

I go in there with my butt set and check - yup there's dial tone, just like every other time I've checked it for them.

BUT - and this is a big but (but not as big as mine) - it's also on the main fax line. What?? Who are me Mom&Pop Inc. with two lines? We have at least 4 1FLs that are just sitting unterminated on a BIX block in some random riser room.

So I go about figuring out how this line gets here (it's in the main electrical room - there's 50,000 volts behind me). I don't make it 18"" before I find a splice (it comes out of a multi-pair cable - maybe 6 pair?) then goes into another conduit. Trace the conduit - it comes out of there and is split into an old telecom screw terminal with a thousand other wires, most going nowhere, then out of that to another splice a foot away and into another conduit leading into the Bell room.

Into the Bell room I go, and find the conduit popping out right behind some massive metal box that the cable company managed to find an inconvenient place for. Trace the cable to another screw terminal where it goes down to an ancient jack on the wall, then back to the demarc via at least two BIX terminations.

So ok, I put my butt set on the BIX terminal that I REALLY need the line to work (ie: the thing that actually receives faxes) then listen as I disconnect the spliced-a-million-times cable from the nearest screw terminal. I still have dial tone, so I didn't break the FAX. Hooray!!!

I tried to pull the old cable out of the conduit so I could use it for a replacement cable, but it's very stuck. Oh well, it can just live there. I found a new path where I can run a simple four pair cable, terminate that on a properly labeled BIX block, put an unused line on it them terminate the other end directly at the alarm panel.

It works, but the alarm is still complaining. At least we know it's their problem now.

BTW: I think the reason for all the splices is that this is something like our third alarm/access control system. The old ones never seem to get entirely removed. There are several empty boxes on the walls with remnants of cables and abandoned-in-place hardware. So, every time we got a new system it the phone line was just spliced to the new box.

I guess next I should pull out all the rest of the dead gear, but who has the time?

UPDATE: Turns out I did break the fax line. There's now a strong 60Hz hum that's keeping the fax from syncing. I can't hear it over the dial tone, but if you listen in on an actual fax it's definitely there and very loud. Looks like I'm pulling out more cable tomorrow.",22,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF787F10>
601,I need Norton 360 to access the internet,"So had an interesting call the other day.  One of our remote sales staff calls me saying that he'd like permission to install Norton 360 on his company laptop.  I tell him I can't allow him to install his personally purchased AV software as we already have AV software on the laptop that would conflict and company policy etc. etc.  Should be the end of the discussion right? Of course not, but this response certainly caught me off guard.

&#x200B;

Salesperson: ""Ok but I really need Norton 360 on the laptop to be able to work. I've been having all kinds of issues.""

Me: ""Well you haven't reached out to me or submitted a ticket""

Salesperson: ""I can't even get online with my work laptop. I need the VPN in my Norton 360 subscription to access the internet!""

Me: "" I- wait what? If you can't connect to your network at home a VPN isn't going to solve anything.""

Salesperson: ""Well everything else is connected and it has the VPN software on it.""

Me: ""That doesn't mean the VPN is the solution. I can tell you for a fact that if your laptop isn't connecting to your network a VPN can't help you.""

Salesperson: ""Well I need the VPN for other reasons too.""

Me: ""Uhhh, like what?""

Salesperson: ""Some really bad people are after me and have hacked my network. That's why I'm having all these issues. That's why I need the VPN. I even have 2 ISPs in my house because Google fiber is supposed to be more secure.""

Me: ""..... "" \*sigh\* ""So bad people were smart enough to hack both of your networks and block a single one of your computers from connecting to the internet, but they are seemingly unable to do anything to block your other internal network devices because of your Norton 360 VPN?""

Salesperson: ""Yeah Norton 360 seems to fix the issue.""

Me: ""Norton isn't a magic wand and it doesn't make your computers invisible. If these bad people are inside your network they can see all the devices and their local IP addresses. It would take no time at all to disable network access to all your devices or even just brick your routers. It is considerably more likely that something else is going on and I'd be happy to troubleshoot that with you so we can get you back up and running.""

Salesperson: ""So you won't let me install Norton 360?""

""Me:"" ""Nope. Now can you tell me more about your setup so I can provide some initial things for you to check?""

Salesperson: ""No, that's ok I know it won't fix anything. I'll just use my personal laptop.""

Me: ""Ok then. I'll note that on my end. Anything else I can help you with?""

Salesperson: ""Actually yeah, my phone has been dropping calls a lot lately.""

We use a cloud based phone system. So I log into check his analytics.

Me: ""So it looks like you are using the Mobile app (totally fine), but a lot of your calls are originating from other countries. Are you using a VPN when you are making calls?""

Salesperson ""Yup.""

Me: ""Well trying to route a VoIP call over a VPN tunnel to halfway across the globe is going to cause significant latency that can cause your bad call quality and dropped calls and I'm seeing that in the logs. I'd recommend not using the VPN while making calls.""

Salesperson: ""But then I can't access my internet!""

Me: ""Have you even tried not using the VPN?""

Salesperson: ""No because it's been working and I need the VPN to protect myself from the people who are out to get me.""

Me: ""Well if you are unwilling to let me troubleshoot your connectivity issues then I can't fix your first issue, and if you won't disable your VPN on your phone I can't fix your second issue. Also, I'll be sending a message to your manager detailing your issues and your refusal to troubleshoot them. If you change your mind please reach out to me.""

606,It's in your Inbox," 

Waaaaay back in the late 90's I was the manager of a support and Help-Desk group. I'd come up through the ranks, so I was (and am) sensitive to the misery of supporting difficult people.

Even as far back as the time of this story, I hated fax machines. Every single tiny little organization in the company seemed able to demand that my group buy and maintain these stupid, fiddly things. As my hatred of them grew, I'd walk around and see them everywhere. It was a nightmare for me.

So, I worked with my boss and got approval for a skunk-works project to use fax capture cards and turn the incoming faxes into TIFF images and forward them as email attachments to the recipient. The project worked, and we scaled up the hardware until we had a box that had sixteen cards in it. We were able to eliminate all the fax machines in the company with this approach, and best of all each person in the company could have their own personal fax number. We could do this because we had a huge block of unused inbound DID numbers that terminated on our Centrex.

After approximately nine hundred million emails to the entire company and several training sessions (that mostly consisted of 'open your email from INBOUND-FAX-xxxx' and you will see your inbound fax' repeated over and over again), we cut over to the new system. People got new business cards hand delivered to their desks, and all was well.

Except for terribly-minor-executive-X in legal (TMEX). This person was apparently having a really, really difficult issue with the new system. He called into the help desk and informed them that he was unable to receive faxes, and that since he was an incredibly important person, he would simply continue to use the old mechanical machine. This was fine, and this situation lasted about a *year*.

After a year or so, the maintenance contract on the old fax machine expired and my boss told me not to renew it. So, we sent an email to TMEX informing him that the old machine would be retired, and that since **\*hundreds\*** of people had been successfully using the new system, we expected that whatever issue he had would no longer be an issue. And so, we disconnected the machine and rolled it away. Everywhere I looked, no fax machines. It was good!

Immediately on Monday we get a call from TMEX.

TMEX ""I have missed hundreds of pages of faxes!""

Help Desk Person ""They're on the log. Let me check something. ""

HDP: ""Yes, they were delivered to your inbox""

TMEX ""No, they weren't""

HDP: ""Oh, let me escalate""

TMEX: ""This entire system is sh\*t, you are sh\*t, and your team is sh\*t! Nothing works!""

So the poor person on help desk escalated the situation to me, and I looked into it. Yes indeed, all the faxes had been delivered to his email and were sitting there unread. So I went over to see this super friendly and kind person.

Me: ""Hello TMEX, it's me from the help desk team, what's the problem?""

He immediately begins cursing at me and blaming me for everything.

*HE THEN POINTS TO HIS PHYSICAL MAIL ORGANIZER WITH A SLOT ON IT LABELED* ***""INBOX""*** and he yells at me. ""See???? There's nothing in my inbox!!! I've missed hundreds of super, insanely, ridiculously important faxes upon which the entire fate of civilization as we know it depend, you massive idiot!!!"" (only a slight exaggeration)

So, I ask him to open his email. This insanely brilliant person has created a spam filter and put our fax system in it.

TMEX: ""I was getting too many emails! You cannot possibly expect me to look at so many emails!""

So I make him a fax folder on his email client.

TMEX: ""But it's NOT in my inbox!""

....

The solution was to have one of the poor, hapless admins get his faxes, print them out, and then physically place them in his 'inbox'.

607,Watching a human buffer,"I work as a student assistant at a University, where I attend the third and last year of Computer Engineering. I work as a helper in the second year Networking class, helping students to follow labs and set up services like simple web/mail servers.

The students throughout the semester are to complete a set of labs that prepare them for two projects. One small project to prepare them for their second, and more extensive project, which is their exam. The labs consists of a walk-through part first, making the students set up the given service that the lab entails, followed up by questions. These questions would be anything from ""Describe how this works"", to change the configuration of what you have just set up to achieve ""THIS"" result. As the labs gets more advanced one could still follow them to a tee, to complete the initial setup, but the questions would eventually get more to the point of having to google, how to do certain things.

As these are second year students one would expect at least a rather basic IT comprehension at this point, and they should be familiar with basic Linux commands and terminal usage.

Some students in their year obviously aren't where their progression in their degree suggests. I have been a helper in other/previous classes too; like intro to Linux, and object oriented programming, so I know to a certain degree which are the stronger and weaker students of the bunch. Of the lesser end of the bunch are a few that stand a bit out... like this one.

(The lab environment is in CentOS 7, which uses systemd, so the accompanying commands are used)

&#x200B;

M = me & ST = student

&#x200B;

ST had a habit of sitting at the lab computer and waiting until I made eye contact, where they would then raise their hand to ask a question. They would only try a command once, and then figure they are either stuck, or progress the lab not caring about the fact that a service isn't running, and then getting more stuck later.

Meanwhile sitting and staring at their screen, they would not make any effort to reading the lab instructions again or googling the errors that might be appearing.

I would always find this a bit fascinating as the first interaction between us, every single time I got up to ST would be something along the lines of:

&#x200B;

M: ""What seems to be the problem?""

As I look at the terminal window to see if I can immediately identify the problem

&#x200B;

ST: ""Well I changed this\* in the config file, and tried the restart command, and it won't start""

\*Points to the lab instructions, where one could input exactly what it says into the config file, and the service would work.

&#x200B;

M: ""Okay, have you looked at the status, which it says right there\*?""

\*Points to the terminal output telling the user what troubleshooting steps they could do on their own.

This is where the now famous, among the student assistants, ""Buffer"" comes along.

&#x200B;

Any time me or the other helper would get to this stage of the conversation, it would be like watching literal gears grinding in their head as they were trying to kick-start their thought process, to figure out what to do next.

The answer would always be ""No, I haven't looked at that"" - ""No, I haven't googled that"" -  ""No, I haven't tried to follow the labs instructions again""

But before every single one of these types of responses I would, in awe, watch as this person spent a total of 5 to 10 seconds sit in complete silence, trying to figure out what to do with the words that just came hurtling in their direction.

&#x200B;

Often times the questions ST had would be of the kind that could be solved by going back into the config file and double checking syntax, or seeing what systemd would output to logs. But time and time again ST would insist on sitting in silence, until making eye contact.. for me to then have to watch as my request for a command or a google search churned away in their head, and them figuring out or being told, their simple mistake.

Yet every single time ST got stuck, I would have to walk over to them. Ask them if they googled it, or ran the command that is currently being displayed in their terminal.. only to watch them sit for an eventual alarming amount of time in silence, processing what I had just said.

It could be something as simple as:

&#x200B;

M: ""Now, please write 'journalctl -xe' and let's see what the output is""

&#x200B;

\*Proceeds to wait 5 seconds for them to process\*

&#x200B;

ST: ""What command to you mean?""

&#x200B;

M: ""The one that is being displayed right there, that we have used before to check what's wrong""

Getting a bit frustrated at this point as we are several labs in and has used the same command multiple times before, even a couple today already.

&#x200B;

ST: Wait for another 5-10 seconds and then proceeds to type in the command.

&#x200B;

M: ""Okay, we can see there is an error in that file.. so could you please cat that for me?""

&#x200B;

\* .... \[for about 5-10 seconds\]\*

&#x200B;

ST: ""What do you mean cat, what file?""

&#x200B;

M:  ""The cat command, we have used several times before to check the contents of a specific file..""

""I'm talking about the file being marked as having errors in the logs we are currently looking at"" \*Points to the file being marked with errors\*



\* .... \* (You know the drill at this point)

&#x200B;

ST: Writes the command, sees the content of the file.

At which point I would either point out a syntax error, or I would let them figure it out on their own, and come back later when they inevitably haven't done anything to figure out their own mistake.

&#x200B;

This would be and currently still is with their projects being worked on, be a reoccurring segment of my day. This has of course only gotten worse as the projects doesn't have any instructions only a requirement for what needs to be set up, but it is completely based on everything the students should have learned in their labs already. Technically one could follow the walk-through of each lab, replacing the contents of config files with the requirements of the projects.. and be all set up... but this is not something that is easily understood by ST

&#x200B;

At times I have theorized that ST is actually a Humanoid Android, that is built to learn about technology like a human.. only the processing unit the creators used is vastly under-performing for the use case.

&#x200B;

Whenever I help ST still to this day I can't help but being a bit fascinated, and also get my tinfoil hat out.

TLDR; Student attending a Computer Engineering degree, has a literal process loading timer. And may or may not be an android.

608,"""Can I have a wake up call for 5am""","TLDR at the end as this got longer than I anticipated it would... 


This goes back a fair few years now (and quite possibly some of the other guys I worked with are on here and will remember this).

Anyway, I used to work support for a hotel management system.  Pretty complete system, making and tracking bookings etc. But it also hooked into a LOT of third party systems, such as point of sale, telephone call logging (automatic charging of calls from hotel rooms to customer bills), accounting software.. You get the idea...
We had one customer, a small group of hotels dotted around the country (UK - I'm being purposefully vague), who had their own internal IT support for general computer/phone issues, and they only were supposed to call us specifically for issues relating to our software.  Part of our job included a rota system where we were on call 24 hours a day, so could get woken up at any point in night. 

So onto the actual event... Their IT either updated or replaced the phones in all bedrooms. Part of this included adding speed dial (you know, ""dial 0 for reception), except (and to this day I can't see how they screwed this up so bad), on ONE phone in ONE bedroom of ONE hotel, they repurposed an old reception phone, and didn't think to check the speed dial, which someone had set to our help desk.
Cue the months of sporadic calls at any time between midnight and 2am from random businessmen asking for 5am (or some other time) wake up calls...

When your woken up at 2am for a ""non emergency"", all you want to do is get them off the phone and go back to sleep, so it was always a quick ""you need to dial reception, this is a support line"" and hang up. It took their IT probably a year or more to find and resolve this issue for us
(I'm pretty sure at one point we asked one of the guys that 'called' us what room he was in so the hotel groups IT didn't even have to find the phone... They were just not that bothered by it).

I'll always remember the day I came off the ""out of hours"" rota... That was a good feeling!!!


TLDR; use to work software support out of hours, and a hotel IT (different company) screw up meant we got wake up call requests from hotel residents for over a year.",54,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF92D5E0>
609,They should be smarter than this.,"I'm the IT manager for a CPA firm. Recently Intuit screwed everything up by forcing mandatory updates. If you didn't install the update, you couldn't use the software. That's an entirely different complaint. 

We've got two hosted environments for QuickBooks. I can't install midday without stopping folks' work, so I move got everyone out of Host A and blocked new logins, and updated Host A. Once that was done I opened Host A back online, and blocked Host B off to new logins. This way, I minimize the impact on the staff, and have an easy resolution for the people who need the updated versions of QuickBooks.

I sent out an email, and a Teams notification, telling everyone what happened. If they don't need QuickBooks, they're fine where they are. If they need QuickBooks and they get the update notification, that means they're in Host B. All they have to do is log out, and when they log back in, they will get forced into Host A, where everything's updated. I tell them all that Host B will be updated this weekend, as per our normal schedule. 

I didn't check my emails until this evening, and what do you know, half a dozen people whining about the QuickBooks notification. And, to make it even more fun, rather than contact the address that goes to both members of the IT department, they decided I was the only one who could help them of their self-inflicted emergency. 

I realize this is sounding incredibly whiney, but it was either this or start a chain of events that probably gets posted on the Antiwork subreddit. One of the people was a firm partner, so it really limits my ability to push back.",37,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF92D640>
610,Just copy and paste....how hard can that be?,"I'm an little old apprentice in a smallish tech company, providing small things like email and web hosting to VPS and co-lo rental. 

With this gentleman, we were dealing with an Outlook issue. Normally quite simple: most problems can be fixed through a phone call or guides, as they are user related. Any other problem are remote support and chargeable. But this gentleman has a track record of being the most difficult of people to help. I have been told that no matter how much you try, the man will just complain.

M= me GM= gentleman

GM: Hi I need help with my Outlook. It's just not working. I've walked into the office today, expecting it to work. You need to help me.

M: Okay, of course. What seems to be wrong with your Outlook? Can you see any errors on screen?

GM: I can't access a website I want to see. Why can I not see it? I've never had an issue like this.

M: ( trying to decrypt the situation) Okay, is the link from an email? And you're trying to open it?

GM: I'm trying to open this link I'm been given and it won't just open. Why is technology so difficult? This is ridiculous.

M: Okay, I can help you with that (while saying this, I'm trying to figure out the best way to help this man without making life more difficult. His voice already sounded like he was close to shouting). So when you click the link, do any errors come up on the screen?

GM: When I click the link, nothing happens. I told you this. Why is this so difficult, f***ing hell. 

M: (doing my best, and at this point I knew that I may be hit with a hurl of abuse) Okay. What I will do is look into this issue, and get back to you. I can give you an alternative method so you can go to those links?

GM: Just tell me how I can open these links.

M: Okay. What we are going to do is copy and paste the link into a browser. (This was a dated version of Outlook that he insisted on using, can't remember which, but did not have the option to open in browser when right clicked) That way you can access what you need to. If you can o....

GM: Sorry, this is an alternative method? Why are you making it more difficult? I'm not technically minded and I just want to open these f***ing links. It's not hard to understand. 

M: That's fine. I can look into the problem and get back to you. What's the best nu....

GM: No, I need this fixed now. I need to open this link. 

M: I can talk through the steps I mentioned just now. That will be a temporary method until I have found a fix for your problem. 

GM: Fine.

M: Okay. Open Outlook and go to the email that has the link in it. When you hover your mouse pointer over the link, your mouse should change into a pointer. Can you see that.

GM: Yes. I can. What now?

M: (getting excited, many struggled to help this man, but I was getting closer to that sweet sweet ticket closure) Okay, so if you right click your mouse now, you should see a small box with some options in it. One should show that says 'copy'. Can you click on the option that says copy for me?

GM: Yes.

M: Okay brilliant. That's half of the method. You've just copied your link to your mouse. Now we need to paste the link into your browser. Can yo.....

GM: No. NO. I am not doing this. You're not helping. Stop doing this and help me. We pay a lot of money to you (the Accounts team called: you don't), and you're not giving me the support I'm entitled to. This is f***ing ridiculous.

I'm walking down the hall of one school and someone is yelling something on the other end of the hall, but I can't hear due to the janitor running the floor buffer.

Teacher: SIR! SIR!

Teacher: My laptop is trash.

Me: Huh?

Teacher: My laptop is trash. I need a new one!!

Me: So, you're having a problem with your laptop? 

Teacher: Yeah it's trash. I want my old one back. Are you going to wipe it?! I need to save my stuff!

Me: I don't even know what the issue is. ""It's trash"" is vague.

Teacher: Well, the mouse (she means touchpad) doesn't work. I can't right click. It's stuck! It's trash!

I go over and get on her laptop. I immediately start right clicking with reckless abandon. Works fine.

Me: Touchpad works fine. I'm using it with out an issue.

Teacher: What?! Of course it works when you are here.

Me: Here try it.

612,When the customer completely forgets what happened on the scoping call,"To set the stage: I support healthcare software which tracks your medical chart but the clinic can also schedule your next appointment in our software. Some customers have a third party schedule application as well that sends reminders and such. We export the schedule data over to them.

This third party was updating the way they map the location of care (LOC) of each appointment, so they wanted all the appointments from the last month re-exported over to them.

This week, Tuesday: Customer puts in a support case with us to push over all the data to the third party. They want it done after hours. I set up a call with the customer to scope out the work. How much data is needed, what time are we going to do this, etc. On the call/screenshare is the practice manager or something, we'll call her Jane (not her real name). Also on the call is Todd (also not his name). Todd is the IT guy who can get us in the database. Todd remotes into the DB server and opens SSMS. I run a couple queries so that Jane can see how much data we're talking about here. We get some input from Todd and together the two of them decide that they want everything from 1 October to the present pushed over to the third party.

Friday: I start the Webex. The rep from the third party, Mark (not his name), joins. Jane joins. We talk about nothing while waiting for Todd. Getting bored and frustrated, I'm asked if I can start the data push. ""No. That's what we need Todd for. I have no access without him."" Jane makes a phone call or something and finally Todd joins the call. Jane explains what we're doing, again, with this call and tells Todd that we need DB access. He says ""Okay, so are you going to send me a LogMeIn or something?"" I explain to him that the Webex info was in the invite that he received on Tuesday. And he called into a Webex conference line just now. So I send him a reminder from the Webex with all the log in info.

He finally joins the screenshare. He then asks what server we need to connect to. Not the function of the server but the server name. The RDP session opens and we're on the server and he asks ""Now what?"" I tell him we need to get into the database and he starts SSMS. Then has to ask for the password.

It's like I was working with an entirely different person. Like he was never an active part of the meeting on Tuesday.

The rest of the call goes pretty well to plan. What should have taken 5-10 minutes at the most has taken 25-30. A little over 30,000 rows of data start flowing and Mark is able to confirm that they're getting the data.",35,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF92D760>

My hubby’s laptop was starting to have issues with the battery, and with his hard drive so I decided it would be a good time to replace it.  I took him to one of the stores that sells laptops and told him to pick one out. He said he didn’t know anything about it, so I chose 2 that were decent and asked him to pick between them for screen size.  

We purchased the computer, plus all the tech support things that way, he could take it back to them if it got messed up.  They loaded all his stuff on the new computer and took care of recycling the old one (including smashing the hard drive). 

When he got it, I was at work.  When I got home, he starts ranting that the computer wouldn’t work because he couldn’t get his email.  I asked him how he got connected to the internet.

For the most part this place used 95% full sized Dell Optiplexes. They had a handful of micro formfactors but they were few and far between and generally reserved for admininstration. I get a call for help from a team room where all of our nurses work and when I get there the one nurse is absolutely frantic.

I take this proclamation with a grain of salt and take a look at the workstation. Monitor is powered on but the screen is black. I look beneath the desk and see.... there's no desktop. All 11 other workstations in this room had those large Optiplexes underneath the desk and this one had nada. Oh shoot... Someone did steal their PC!

I call up the boss and say hey, what do we do? There's no PC here, I think it may have been stolen! He tells me to sit tight and comes on down.

Boss gets down to the room within ten minutes and does the same examination I do and comes to the same conclusion, this PC was jacked right from under our noses! He starts talking to the other nurses about who has been in the room recently, starts making calls to security to get logs, writes an email up  to finance to purchase a replacement...

...then another nurse walks up to us and asks, ""Did you check behind the monitor?""

619,The guy who experiments while learning,"Definitely before my IT days, I was doing a theatre course and I helped in the office (Windows 3.1 days).  We only had one PC, no backups except a few files on Floppies - hey, we were all young and dumb once.  But the PC was shared.

Cast:Me: Aspiring Actor (still do amateur dramatics) and already the guy to call about the PCNapalm: A friend (and somehow he remained a friend) that for apparent reasons we shall call Napalm  
The Mac: Course tutor, good with Amiga computers (used in sound industry programs back then but not skilled with PCs)

One day, having to do something (25+ years ago, no idea what) I arrived at the PC.  To find the vast majority of the files missing.  Now, in truth we had been running low on disk space so had managed to updrade from DOS 5 to DOS 6.22 which had Doublespace (or was it Drivespace?) to get some more space that we needed.  But before using it, I wanted to read a bit about it first as I didn't know what to do.  Napalm did not share my cautious approach and had doublespaced the drive - successfully.  But the disk had already been partitioned into two.  He managed to delete all the files on the second partition (permanently - no internet to download software and no cash either), leave the space wasted without a partition and just doublespaced the rest.  This is how I found the PC when I arrived.

I called him over for a quick word...

Now, at the time that this happened, I did not know him well.  And I was not a prope tech person yet, having not known until later that day that hard disks could be partitioned (we all learn one day).  I thought that he may have taken the D:\\, at the time having assumed that it was a second physical drive.  Also, Napalm (who was an expert at destroying a wide range of things - he once helped construct a set that none of the actors was willing to stand on) had tools at the theatre to open the case which I did not.  So, with me observing (his tools) took the cover off the tower.  Nothing apparant and the dust make it clear no second drive had been taken so we went to put it together again.

Somehow - *somehow*, Napalm found a live wire to earth itself against the case, blowing power to the theatre.  And wiping the music that The Mac had been doing at his amega in the other office.  The Mac came into our office, somewhat vexed, to find Napalm repeating endlessly ""I don't know what happened, it's not my fault"" and me in the corner with a fit of histerical laughter having really understood '*the napalm effect'* for the first time.

Never did get the files back but thankfully the theatre had a qualified electrician to hide the live wire that, to this day, I don't know where Napalm found.",10,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF92DA00>
620,"But I'm an engineer, furthermore I have a woody.","Ok, so this goes back a bit, round 2011, working for a major company that sometimes created computers that could beat chess players. Sometimes.
Worked onshore supporting native and offshore consumer model line lappys and desks. I was the complaints and escalations, so I also had to work the shit hours in my region. 

Call comes in during business hours, he's a squeaky wheel, won't accept terms of warranty and so forth so he ends up with me. I am normally a guy who kills with kindness but this bloke really wound up all the staff before me. Reproduction of the convo, so apologies its not verbatim.
Client will be ''Client'' because I fucking hate the dollar sign garbage on this thread it makes me want to throw up. Sorry.
I will be ''me'' because I am me.

Client: I want a full replacement of my laptop, I've had five discussions, five. I have a full replacement warranty and I am familiar with the dimensions of the contract.

Me: I understand your needs, however the contract states certain preclusion's upon which we cannot service or replace your laptop.

Client: This is not good enough I'm sick of this! IT IS WATER DAMAGE!!!!

Me: Yes I have the insurance claim you submitted, it shows you lost the device whilst onboard a yacht on open waters, well, I think open waters if that is correct sir?

Client: YES. I WAS USING IT AND IT SLID OFF MY LAP I CAUGHT IT AS IT FELL I STILL HAVE IT THEREFORE IT IS WATER DAMAGE.

His voice was almost but not quite at crescendo, I waited a moment and replied..

So you took a laptop onto a boat, on open water on an ocean or lake, and lost control of it. Any water damage you experienced was as a result of you and your actions in using the device outside the specific parameters of the warranty that you had advised you were familiar with.

Boats, sir, are not normal operating environments for a laptop.

Client: BUT IM AN ENGINEER! (he then hung up)

Where does the Woody part come in?
At the time this call became legend, in the call centre, I had a tiny slightly adjustable figurine of Woody from Toy Story, which was my sons and as a toddler he ''gave'' to me so it sat on my desk.

Any time someone would have an issue that was insurmountable and through talk I detected it was headed for my desk I would say capping off a sentence in an thoroughly English accent ''furthermore, ...............I.........have a Woody'' (then produce the Woody toy).

So, by mutation, in the call centre, the staff would say privately in between calls about arsehole callers...''but im an engineer and I HAVE A WOODY''.

Kinda proud of that one.

Also not proud Australian pronunciation is deemed wrong by this chat box. It is not center, it is centre. Where I am born, raised and work, it is right.

Edit: Was a bit of a rant, and preclusion is correct thank you internet folks. Not my finest post.",89,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF92DA60>

623,Losing Brain Cells At Work Part 1,"It’s been a while since I’ve posted a tale on here but you’re in for a treat. I had two notorious calls today, one in the morning and the other in the afternoon. I’ll break it up into two parts to avoid making this long.

The first call comes from someone at a health services clinic we service who is unable to get into their EMR account. I go through my usual spiel of greeting and grabbing this persons info. So from the get go, she is unable to sign into her EMR account as mentioned earlier. I go in and reset her password, because we have the option that we can set it to what they want, they spell out and when I verify spelling, she corrects it saying a letter I’ve never in my life heard, (pronounced ara) I’m like you mean r? She’s like “nooooo, it’s ara…. I’m like ok then… so I go and just give her a temp password, she then tells me “I’m in the system, i don’t need my password reset. I respond, “so are you able to get in but just can’t see the charts?” She responds “no I can’t get into the EMR!” But more than likely you’re locked out. She again responds “No I’m in the system.” 

I’m already confused as it is. So I ask her to go to a website to do a remote session to see what’s going, I tell her to open Chrome and type in the web address in the search bar… Simple enough. Right? Right?….. Wrong! We wasted 15 minutes trying to a do a remote session and the person acted like she was taking the SAT’s…. And we’ve been busy on the phones for our tech support lines so I had to dump this off to the on-site tech to further assist since she had no idea where to go or how to search a website…. Idk how some of these people get jobs that involve heavy computer use and not know how to search the web…",35,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF92DB80>
624,Smartest guy in the room? Maybe not.,"Another story involving $bigboss, but this introduces a new character, who we'll call supertech, or $st for the sake of brevity.  We'll all use $bb for bigboss.

$st had been hired to help our support group plus do some web and database work for a professor's research project.  $st was pretty smart, but didn't have the best people skills, basically he let everyone know that he was the smartest person in the room and everyone should follow his lead.  Of course this got old pretty fast, but he did have some good ideas.  My largest issue with $st was his desire to make our entire infrastructure over into something he was more familiar with, rather than him have to learn our existing systems, which were actually pretty cool.

One thing we had that $st was not familiar with was a fancy file server.  He was eager to learn about it and I spent some time showing him the various features, how to create volumes, set permissions, create and change exports, and resize volumes, which could be done on the fly.  He got pretty interested in all the cool things that could be done and went off to explore on his own.  

This server supported our entire mail spool environment, along with various user home directories and special research volumes, so it was more or less the lynch pin of our infrastructure, right up there with our network switches, very little worked without it, but it was extremely robust.

One day $st went by my office and said he was going to lunch, which really meant to the gym, and he would be gone for 90 minutes or so.  No problem, I was having lunch at my desk that day.    After a while I got a phone call from our administrative person in the front office, $bigboss was having problems with email, I needed to look into it ASAP.  

I checked my email and could see old messages, but nothing new was coming in.  I logged into the mail server and could see it was rejecting all new messages, basically ""no space on device"" situation.  I was concerned that something had happened to the file server, but access to other volumes was fine, then I saw that the ""mail"" volume was 100% full.  This was weird, had never happened before, but I thought about for a second and realized the size of the volume looked smaller than I remembered.   I resized it (again this could be done on the fly, pretty cool for the early 2000s), and once I did this I could see mail now flowing normally.  I watched it for a while, then headed off to $bb's office to make sure he was ok.

When I got there, $st and $bb were in front of $bb's desktop, muttering about email.  I had figured out that $st had almost certainly resized the volume ""to save space"".   I asked if email was ok, and $bb told me that the problem had magically vanished, and did I know what happened.  I simply said our mail volume had filled up, but I had enlarged it enough to avoid having it happen again.  

$st, realizing what he had done was staring at me, wondering if I was going to rat him out, but I had to work with him, and anyone can make a mistake.  $bb just said thanks, and he hoped we'd keep an eye on stuff like this in the future.  $st and I assured him we would and walked together back to our office.  $st was pretty quiet on the way back, it one of those ""I know what you did, and you know, that I know what you did"" situations.  He was pretty embarrassed, but I figured he had learned his lesson on messing around with stuff you don't understand, especially when you are about to walk out of the office for a couple of hours, and you don't tell anyone what you did.",27,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF92DBE0>

We went through the normal diagnostic procedures, ending with the fix-all ""switch it off and back on again"" but to no avail, so I went up to take a look (and listen). Sure enough it was making a short beeping noise every few minutes. I unplugged it completely from power, and it was still doing it so I took the lid off and removed the CMOS battery. To my amazement it was still beeping.  Then for some reason I looked up and noticed a smoke detector right over his desk with the little red ""low battery"" LED flashing.

626,Call in the big guns,"A long time ago, I worked at company that provided a service for other businesses that involved storing very large quantities of video data. From camera to server. For various reasons video records were required to be held for many years. So the data was archived to blue ray disk several times a day to make sure the servers didn't get overloaded.

One of our biggest clients was suddenly unable to back up their data on any of their machines. This was a big problem because due to the sheer volume of video they recorded even their substantial server would get completely full in within a couple weeks if it couldn't be archived.

I was a front line tech for this process at the time, but it was quickly escalated well over my head after basic troubleshooting. Making sure the blu rays were right side up, checking the archive settings to make sure nothing had been inadvertently switched off, testing the connection between the archive machine and the server, etc. Big programming and engineer brains were combing over the set up before end of day, trying to figure out what had caused this seemingly spontaneous error.

Before long it was going to come to a point where the entire system was unusable. The lead developer, a guy who had been at the company for decades and had been integral to the programming of all the products we currently had on the market, flew across the country to get physically in front of the server for potential offline reimagining, manual backups, or whatever other wizardry was needed to unproblem this.

He flew across the country, went straight from the airport to the archive machinery, opened the case to check the machinery of the archive machine, and said, ""These are cds."" And they were.

It had been one of the first questions asked.",56,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF92DCA0>
627,A networking cabinet tries to assassinate a co-worker,"We've managed to make networking exciting for at least ten people!

I help teach a course for computer security and basic networking on a military base, it's a week long course that includes an introduction to networking (think network layers, DNS, IPV4/6 etc). 

We take over a classroom that has a bunch of trunking with power/network, which leads over to a small classroom with a big 48U cabinet patch panel (for the  classroom and another room). Naturally we use it as a good demonstration for a physical network (and also so we don't have to run our own infrastructure for the internal network). 

&#x200B;

My colleague decides to show the course students the patch panel, and opens the tempered glass door of the cabinet. 

This is where things get a lot more.... explosive

As he's talking to the students and standing in front of the cabinet, the glass door spontaneously and instantly turns into thousands of small chunks of glass. The door quite literally just blew up with an enormous BANG and peppered the students and my colleague with tiny shards of glass, almost as if a hand grenade went off.

The force of the shattering was significant enough to project the glass chunks out of the open door of the room, into and down the corridor. 

As you could imagine the language used at that moment was less than polite! Fortunately he threw himself in front of the students to shield them from the glass, and **Un**fortunately got a few cuts and scrapes from the projectile. 

One student got a tiny cut on their neck, whilst my colleague continued to talk bleeding everywhere, I'd say that's proper commitment to the lesson.

&#x200B;

It turned out his uniform boots had suffered a long gash from the force of the shrapnel, and his laces had been sliced by a stray chunk. The boots now glint in the sunlight (We've now called that pair the ""Fabulous Footwear""). 

We also joke that someone must have tried to assassinate him via networking equipment and failed. 

The running theory is that the glass must have been under some form of stress, and the movement of opening the door must have started tiny cracks, which just expanded and shattered it, sending tempered glass in all directions! 

We swept it up, replaced the door with a metal one, and mulled over the freak accident. Building management chalked it up as something that really wasn't anyone's fault. After a shower and change of uniform, the guy was back to teaching in the afternoon. 

I'd like to say that was the only piece of equipment we managed to destroy that week, but sadly that is not the case...

628,"""I Plugged It In Two Times so It Would Be Twice As Fast""","It has been awhile since I have had a chance to post. The labor market is tight on supply which means,  as a consultant, my inbox is constantly full of work requests. And even though I've increased my rates for new customers by 50% businesses seem more than happy to still pay my hourly rate. There is no way the market can sustain hourly rates like this, but I'm going to make the cash while it lasts, even if that means 80 hour weeks.

Anyway, just had a job ghost on me tonight (I'll keep the deposit, thank you very much wanker guy who let me drive the whole way to a job site to find the place locked up tight) so here is a funny short one I recently ran into recently.

And, as always, no matter how you market yourself, no matter how much branding you splash over everything, no matter if your name is actually James Bond, if you are an IT consultant you will also be known as the ""IT Guy.""

**Introduction**

I'm doing some on-site project management for one client. Standard equipment and network refresh stuff being handled by another contractor. My job is to keep them on time and on task. I don't get the ins-and-outs of why two contractors to do the job, but they are paying me an inflated hourly rate so none of my business. The contract specs are crystal clear. The other company handles all the technical stuff and I manage the timeline. In fact, there is a clause that I'm not even supposed to touch the equipment. Maybe it is security, maybe it is some government funding BS, maybe someone's brother is making a ton of cash on a weird deal, doesn't really matter to me. But, those are the terms, don't touch the stuff.

**""The Network is Down!""**

I'm at my desk looking at the timeline, checking on some deliveries, and about ready to hop on a status update meeting. The job is going well. Despite the supply chain, we are still getting deliveries more or less on time. I've got to move around a few things, but looks like we are going to finish on time and under budget. That is as long as the clowns the other contractor have don't f- it up.

The first set of guys were fine. They were seasoned system admins who came in and did all the backroom stuff over a long weekend. Looked good and their supervisor gave me a full briefing. But, for some reason, maybe the market or just saving a few bucks, they fielded the bomb squad of techs to deploy workstations. I mean these guys were so dumb there was no way they could ever figure out they were dumb kind of stupid.

They literally had flip books of every step to follow including how to take the machine out of the box and where to stage the mouse and keyboard. I've never seen anything like this although, but whatever it isn't rocket science getting these things up and running. They seem to be doing an adequate job meeting the goal and the end of the day.

That is until one guy screams, ""the internet is broken!""

**Outage Outrage**

It is the middle of the workday and this company is going full tilt with sales. The location is almost fully staffed and of course one of the big sales guys has a 5pm deadline to get something to a client. After a few minutes of confusion, one of the company leads comes into the conference room where I have set up shop and asks me if I can take a look. They can't find their internal guy anywhere.

Now I am generally pretty helpful even if it isn't in my scope of work, but here I'm a bit hesitant. The contract said I'm not to touch the equipment. I'm there for project management only. So, I tell the lead that I'm not comfortable unless he can give me something in writing.

IT Guy: ""Look the contract is pretty specific here...""

Lead: ""Is there anything you can do. We have a call in for our guy but no one knows where he is and these other contractors have no idea what is going on....""

IT Guy: ""If you can give me something in writing....""

Lead: (frustrated) ""All the brass are off site today and I'm in charge, but I don't have much authority. There is going to be a revolt in about 15 minutes unless we do something now. I'll write you an email or something as long as you can just maybe take a look. Don't do anything, but just see if you can get a handle on what we need to do...""

OK....good enough for me. Send me that email.

**Well That Was Easy**

I start by taking a look in the backroom. Switches and firewall all look stable. Servers are all running. But, then I notice a few of the switches have a ton of activity. Like flashing more then the Christmas Tree in the town square kind of action going on. Hmm....that is weird.

I ask the Lead to take me to where drop 47 is because that switch is acting particularly strange from just the optics of it. He starts looking around at the plates and gets a some lady to help him. But whoever did the wiring job actually kept the drops sequential order (nice job guy whoever, wherever you are) which made it easier to track down.

This takes us to an area where these contractors are staging the new equipment. Gomer and his pals are just sitting around playing on their phones presumably because they can't complete their current staging job until the network is back up.

I ask the one guy to show me how they have the staging area wired and he points over to a mess of cables, routers, hubs, and other network equipment. I start tracing back all the various cables and find one router jacked into two sequential drops. Well that is the issue right there - simple broadcast storm.

IT Guy: ""Hey why did you do that?""

Gomer: ""The internet was slow so we plugged it in again to make it go faster.""

Ugh. These idiots brought down an entire network for almost an hour because they lack basic tech skills.

I tell the lead what needs to be done and once we clear the loop and power cycle the affected switches everything is back up and running. Just in time for their in-house IT team to come busting through the main door....

**Back to Work**

I go back to the conference room where I have my ad hoc office and complete whatever I was doing for that day. At 5 the Lead comes in and thanks me profusely. Apparently whatever the deal was with the deadline was a huge deal and they were just able to transmit all the files right before a contractual deadline that if it was missed out have cost them a huge chunk of revenue.

Of course no good deed goes unpunished. Apparently one of the in-house guys caught wind that I helped troubleshoot the problem and made a fuss (don't know why or his motivation). Glad I had the email and the Lead, to his credit, had my back when Legal came to investigate. It was a mild pain, but the Lead has given me multiple good reference since so maybe it was worth it.

About a week after the job concluded I got an unexpected knock at my door. It was a delivery driver with a nice gift basket. Surprised, I looked for a note. Turns out it was from the Lead and the note had  a simple inscription ""Thanks IT Guy!""",45,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF92DD60>

631,"Confused user calls MSP for help, still gets assistance. +bonus story","Short one for yall today.

I work for an MSP. All our clients are small and medium business, plus the presidents OG clients from when he started the company. 

At the time I was a T1 and while I didn't take the call, I heard it being taken by another T1 coworker. 

User calls, needs help with something browser related. Is asked the standard question ""and what company are you calling from?"" and answers. Coworker becomes progressively more confused as she can't find any information about the company. They're not even in the offboarded database. Coworker asks if the company ever changed names, gets a negative. 

My coworker starts to think that maybe the user had just searched for a tech support company in our area and called a random one, and after asking the user it's revealed to be exactly what happened. She explains the mixup to the user (that we only support businesses) but bless her, still helps the user troubleshoot and fix her problem. (I think it had to do with Chrome settings)

User didn't get angry, or beligerant. I honestly wish half our clients acted as well as a complete rando who found us on Google.

Bonus: The customer is usually wrong, but sometimes the tech is also an idiot.

My job at the above-mentioned MSP is my first and current tech support job. I've moved to bench, but for my first 4 months I was T1 phone support. There has been at least one time I can currently remember that I was certainly an idiot on the phone. There are probably more, and at least one that I'm still too embarrassed about to share.

I was dealing with user on RDS having issues with the USB printer pass-through. Most likely beyond me at the time, so I needed to gather info and bump. Whoops, need to get computer name to remote in as login is shared and generic. No issue. Ask if users knows the name. Nope. That's fine! I know several ways to guide the user though getting the name. I start trying them. User is confused, doesn't see what I'm telling her to see, can't find the name. I start just assuming this woman is an idiot. Nothing is working. I've reached my time limit.

Turns out the RDS server is running a few windows 7 clients for compatability with some weird clunky medical shit. I never thought to ask, she never though to tell.

632,not enough spam? another $bigboss incident,"I've mentioned $bigboss in a previous post or two, here's another one.  Its mostly an example of how managers can waste people's time.

We ran a fairly basic mail server, with anti spam blacklist and DNS blacklist, so not totally ""Wild West"", but not like a fancy corporate or outsourced solution for sure.    

Anyway, our story starts with me working hard, probably reading slashdot or something similar.  I get an email from $bigboss, he's concerned that there is something wrong with our email.   He isn't getting as many messages as he would expect to, not even getting as much spam as he's used to.

I'm kind of raising an eyebrows at this, not many folks complain about NOT getting spam.  Anyway I follow up with him to see if he has any examples of messages he EXPECTED to get, but did not.   Has someone told him that they sent him something but he did not receive it?   No, its just a feeling.  He's sure he isn't getting as many emails as normal, please can I check it out.

We did track email on a very macro level, total messages in and out, graphed hourly, spam messages, fairly basic stuff, nothing at the user level.  So, to the mail logs I go.   I spent about an hour going back through the logs, grepping for messages to $bigboss, sorting and counting them day to day for the previous week.   Of course what I found is the number of messages varied enough each day that I couldn't really tell if he was missing any or not.  And all the time I'm rolling my eyes over the time wasting because $bigboss has a ""feeling"".  No other user is raising this issue, I'm certainly not seeing it myself.

After my sorting/counting/comparing project produces no real results (not that I expected it to), I email him that I've checked, don't see anything wrong, our mail volume is about what it normally is, certainly not markedly different than the day before, but I'll keep an eye on it ""just in case"".  He emails back a thank you, and that's the end of it.

He never raised this issue again and I think he was probably being bugged by something completely different and just needed to vent to someone who had to listen.",32,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF92DEE0>

She was also not able to remove her PC from the dock or it would power off immediately.  I informed her she would need to ship the laptop to our office so I could get it repaired.  She had broken the USBC port on her laptop as others could use her same dock and everything worked.

She was sent a loaner laptop and we were walking her through getting logged into it, and it required her to plug the ethernet cable into the laptop so her profile could be built.  This is where the problem came in - it wasnt getting a LAN connection.

I told her to plug an ethernet cable into the wall, and asked her to verify she was getting link lights where the ethernet cable (or as she called it, the big phone cable) plugged into the laptop.  I also let her know she needed to push it in hard to hear and feel the click.

No link lights.

We went through replugging both ends and checking.

No link lights.

We tried a different cable, and by now, she has gone and gotten a couple more sets of eyes as hers ""were bothering her and she didnt want to wear her glasses.""  OK, that's fine.

No link lights.

I am repeatedly asking them to look into the laptop socket where the ethernet cable plugs in and see if there are lights.

No link lights.

By this time, others have stopped in and were talking and I could hear them all saying they cannot see any lights.  Speakerphones are ""wonderfull"".  So I asked one more time for someone to physically pick up the laptop and verify there were any lights where the cable plugged in.

I hear from one of the newcomers; ""Yep, there are lights there, one flashing one solid.""

The rest of the crew - ""Oh, we thought you meant on the wall.""

Turns out the message she was getting on the laptop was not "" Account not found"" but ""Invalid password.""  Remember the part of not wanting to wear her glasses...  Was on that phone call for 45 minutes.",20,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF92DFA0>
635,Sorry For Fixing Their Problems,"This is a story about a time I literally saved a hospitals network and got in trouble for doing it.  I will do my absolute best not to embellish facts but bear in mind this was a bit ago and exact dialog has been lost to my not-so-great memory.  Also i'm terrible at formatting on reddit, sorry if this looks terrible.  Also sorry for the length, this is going to be a long story.

Backstory:

Late 2019 I started my networking career in my first big-boy networking job as a L2 network engineer.  I worked for a medium-sized tech company in a different department prior to this new position, but after expressing my interest and lots of personal training I managed to land a job in their tiny networking department.  I was ecstatic; networking was exactly what I wanted to do and this was my foot in the door.  The pay was absolutely abysmal and management was overbearing, but it'll look great on the resume.  At this point I was nearing a decade at this company and had received numerous awards for multiple different things; I was well known and well liked, getting the job was a piece of cake once I was ready.  

One thing worth mentioning is that this tech company had offices all over the continent, one of which was in my city.  This wasn't the headquarters mind you, but just a satellite office for service desk.  I worked from home for many years without issue, but after a while I started to get cabin fever and asked if I could, at my own discretion, pop into the office occasionally to get out of the house.  This was approved and I setup a desk at the office for whenever I felt like stretching my feet.

Then I got this networking position.  There were no networking coworkers in my office, just little old me.  My boss was in another city far away.  You might be thinking ""Katha, that must mean you can continue your WFH arrangement right? You're not missing anything at the office"".  Nope, my direct boss had to drive an hour to his office because he was part of management, and if he had to suffer so did I.  I had to drive to the office.....just because.  Although this didn't sit well with me, it was what it was. This just shows what kind of mindset management had.

Fast forward to mid 2020; COVID is in full swing and hospitals are starting to struggle.  A couple of months prior we had signed up a tiny hospital in a rural town about an hour away.  One of the services we offered was network monitoring and remediation, and because I was the only network engineer within 500 miles, it was my responsibility to do....stuff.  They were extremely vague about what I would be asked to do and what we could dispatch a field tech to do, whatever gave them more control over me.

Story:

Cast: $Me, $SC (site contact), $B (Boss), $BB (Bosses Boss)

3:00PM.  I was starting to relax as the day was just about over, thoughts dancing in my head about what i'm going to do after work (spoiler alert: nap).  Then we received a P1 alert:  The domain controller at the hospital went offline.  More P1s started rolling in, core switch stack went offline and took everything else with it.  We received dozens of P1s for every device and immediately a P1 bridge was spun up.  Recognizing this was more than likely a network failure and representing the network department, I jump on the bridge.

$B and I jump on and we start our inspection to determine the scope of the outage.  Nothing on the inside of the firewall is responding, period.  Looking over our documentation and diagrams its evident the core switch had some sort of failure but we weren't sure how bad this was.  We got $SC on the line and verified the server room had power and the devices were powered.  Everything checked out, and it was decided I needed to go onsite. I pack up my tools, jump in the truck and drive the hour out there.  By this point it's 4PM.

5PM I roll into the parking lot and walk inside.  I make my way to the server room and meet with $SC.  I do a quick inspection of the equipment and everything is lit, but one thing I noticed immediately is every single port that was enabled is flashing concurrently and consistently.  Red flag.  I setup my laptop and call into the bridge and let them know i'm onsite.  Let the troubleshooting begin!  While $B and $BB are talking about potential issues and trying their best to think of troubleshooting steps, i'm already working.

First thing I check is the firewall downlink, checked out.  I plug the switch back into the firewall and patch my laptop directly into the switch.  When I pinged the switch management IP it was dropping half the pings and the time was all over the place, a couple of ms up to several seconds each.  This didn't make sense, and mentioned my findings to the people on the bridge.  

My boss goes quiet for a couple of seconds.

>$B ""Are you working off to the side?""  

>$Me ""Um...yes?  They need to get working right? Shouldn't I be troubleshooting? Isn't that why i'm here?""

>$B ""No, you're there as an extension of us, we need you to follow our exact instructions.  Do not do anything on your own without us knowing about it first.""

I should mention that my cellphone was on speaker so I could use both of my hands to type commands.  $SC, the technical director for the hospital, was sitting next to me helping me troubleshoot.  He wanted this thing fixed and fixed NOW.  He was a very patient and nice person, but there was a lot of pressure to get this working and he was happy up until this point with what I was doing.  When he heard my boss say that, he lost his shit.  I put my phone on mute. 

>$SC ""Did they just say they don't want you to do anything?""

>$Me ""Sorry you had to hear that, I have no idea what the issue is but i'm very confused why they don't want me troubleshooting this""

>$SC ""That is completely unacceptable, how the hell are you supposed to help get this working if you aren't allowed to do anything? Why are you even here then?""  

>$Me ""Your guess is as good as mine.""

>$SC ""I don't care what they say.  Let's keep going, fuck them.""

Eventually they started giving me troubleshooting commands (notably, commands I already ran) and with the info I provided back they determined the first switch in the core was faulty and needed to be replaced.  Oh yeah, I forgot to mention that this switch ""stack"" wasn't actually stacked, it was daisy chained switch 1 -> 2, 2 -> 3.  

>$B (to $SC) ""Unfortunately it looks like the first switch is malfunctioning and not passing traffic properly.  It will need to be replaced, we'll go ahead and check on the warranty info and see if we can get one overnighted""

At this point this did not jive with what I was witnessing, but I had a hunch of what it could be.  I hadn't witnessed one of these in the wild yet, but it might be...

>$Me (to the people on the bridge) ""Hey guys, I need to put you on hold for a second.""  I muted my mic and talked directly to $SC.

>$Me ""Look, i've got a sneaking suspicion that the switch is fine but there could be something else going on called a broadcast storm.  There is a really easy way to determine whether this is true or not, and what's the worst thing that could happen? We take down your network?""

We both got a good laugh out of that

>$SC ""Yes, let's do it, what do we have to lose? What do we do?""

>$Me ""Start unplugging patch cables until we start getting replies back to my pings.  If they stabilize then it's a broadcast storm, if they don't then this switch is probably faulty.""

I start the persistent ping and we start unplugging cables while I keep an eye on the ping.  We get to the very last cable and, up until this point we had no luck, but once we unplugged the SFP module the switch magically stabilized.

>$Me (with a smirk on my face): ""Looks like we found the cause of the issue.  Your switch is fine, but we have to find where the loop is.  Where does this fiber module go?""

>$SC ""That goes to an out building with offices, i've got keys we can go over there.  Can we isolate it and get the hospital back online?""

>$Me ""Yes, let's plug these cables back in and everything should be ok very quickly once the APs power back up.""

By this point i've been on hold for maybe 2 minutes.  I unmute my mic.

>$Me ""Hey guys, we found the cause of the issue.  The switch is fine, this is a broadcast storm""

>$BB ""A broadcast storm? What the hell is that? Is that even a thing? That doesn't sound real""

>$B ""Yes it's a real thing and it's not good.  Katha, why do you think that?""

I explained my troubleshooting steps.

>$B ""Ok, yeah that sounds like a broadcast storm to me.  Go to the offices with $SC and see if we can locate the loop.  Stay on the line with us so we can guide you""

>$Me ""Yeah, ok"" *eye roll*

We verify everything in the hospital has started coming back up, and off to the other building we go.  We go through several IDFs until we isolated the loop to a single section of offices that the SC didn't have a key to.

>$SC ""Disconnect them.  If they fucked up they can deal with no internet until I can get in there and find out where this loop is""

We disconnected the offices and hooked up the out building back to the network and verified everything was good.

At this point it's midnight.  We verify everything is good and I leave.  Got home at 2AM.  Back up at 8AM to get back to work, with the expectation of atleast a high-five.

>$BB and $B ""Katha we need to have a word about your actions last night""

>$Me ""Sure, what's up?""

>$B ""You didn't include us in any of your troubleshooting, we were effectively in the dark.  We told you earlier that we didn't want you doing anything without us telling you.  You went rogue.""

>$Me ""I went rogue?! I saved them several thousand dollars instead of replacing a switch that was perfectly good, we got their network up in a fraction of the time it would have had I followed your directions.  What exactly did I do wrong there?""

>$BB ""None of that matters, you are too inexperienced to be making these decisions and taking troubleshooting in your own hands.  You made you, me and $B look very unprofessional.  You need to learn to follow directions.""

>$Me (defeated) ""Ok.  Sorry for fixing their problems""

Unfortunately for them, $SC was extremely happy with my performance, and extremely pissed at my bosses.  His email said as much, to the account executive and bosses.

He called me up personally and thanked me for my hard work that night, and gave an update on what he found.  The next morning he heard complaints of no internet in those offices.  He went over and found an idiot had plugged a patch cable from one wall port into another, no idea why.  He lit that employee up about the $2000 bill he was about to receive.  He was pissed when I off-hand mentioned that I was reprimanded for fixing their issues.",102,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF92E040>

638,security policy? or not,"In my previous job I provided IT and general computer support for a University research department.   My group was also tasked to assist the office of the Dean of our School within the University since they had no IT support of their own, and they didn't want to rely on the main University IT department as these folks had a less than stellar reputation.

The Dean was a pretty cool guy, and it was very good policy to help him as much as possible.   Its always good to have your boss's, boss's, boss on your side.

At one point our main University IT guys were getting gigged by outside auditors for allowing use of ""free"" file sharing services.  Needless to say, many professors all over the University were using such services to distribute assignments, updates, quizzes, and the like to students.   However since such services are totally insecure, use was to be discouraged.   This came up once in a meeting I had with the Security Officer for our main IT department, a person I had worked with a lot and respected.  He informed me that was against University policy to use free file sharing by any member of faculty or staff.   I didn't use such services so I just filed this conversation away.

Sometime later I was meeting with Dean about a special project and the issue of how to distribute some information, and he said ""we could just use <free\_file\_share>"".  I mentioned that I had been informed that this was against policy, stated to me by the SO.  Dean just said that this was the craziest thing he had every heard, and if I had a chance please get the actual policy as written in the official University policy manual.   I didn't follow up on this at the time but not much later the matter came up in another meeting.

This meeting was with the Deputy CIO and a member of the CIO's staff.  I don't remember what we were discussing but as we were finishing up I remembered the Dean's request, recounted my conversation, and asked if they could point me to the policy.

The staff member launched into a long, meandering, statement about how we were all responsible for data security, and should be setting a good example to the rest of the users at the University, and how we all needed to follow best practices.   I answered that I agreed with everything he had just said, but could he please tell where I could find this policy?

Staff member started to basically repeat everything he had just said, and also had twisted in his chair so he now looking away from me, avoiding eye contact.  I glanced over at the DCIO who was sitting very quietly, not looking at either one of us.  I'm thinking this is really weird.  The DCIO was someone I had worked with off and on, liked and respected, so I was totally confused as to why my question seemed to be such a problem.

Staff person finally finished their speech, I again stated that I agreed with everything, but I still would like the official policy since the Dean has specifically ASKED me to get it.   I'm beginning to get a bit pissed off since I'm asking a perfectly reasonable question.   Staff member started to rehash his speech for the third time, kind of has an edge to his voice like I'm being unreasonable or maybe I'm just too stupid to understand what he's saying.    I look at the DCIO again,  she staring down at the table with her hands shading her eyes.

I break in on the speech and ask again about the policy.   DCIO drops her hands, looks straight ahead and announces, ""ITS NOT A POLICY"".   Both the staff person and I shut up, and there's silence.   I just calmly say, ""thank you"".  

DCIO proceeded to explain that they were working on setting up a secure file sharing option, at which point they would implement a policy forbidding use of free services.   I didn't ask anymore about this, it was pretty clear they both were kind of embarrassed, apparently they had been pushing this ""policy"" and no one had ever asked to see it in writing.  

A bit later I updated the Dean and he had a laugh at my description of the conversation.  It remains one of the more surreal experiences of my time in that job.",15,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF92E160>

> $DU - Yes.   
> $Me - That's why. The *vendor program* password does not change when you reset your citrix/email password. You will need ot use your old password for it.

She does.

I will give you exactly one guess as to what happens next. 

> $DU - So why did I have to use my old PW. Is something wrong with my account?

> $Du - Yes.   
> $Me - OK that ONLY resets the intranet, email, citrix, and *our company* branded programs. It does not change *these 3 vendor programs* passwords. So when you reset your password on *PW site* it does not change the *vendor program* password.   

A full minute of silence with me repeatedly trying to get her attention. 

> $DU - Oh sorry im here. So whats wrong with my account?   
> $Me - Nothing. Your password is working exactly as intended. 

I hung up the phone and wrote it up as. ""Helped user get into *vendor program* using her old password. She either was not listening or simply failed to understand that *vendor program* and AD were separate entities. Terminated call and cried myself to sleep.""

640,"New boss, new hell","Many years ago I was part of the Unix tech support team managing a set of high end IBM Power servers (p595's). Our team leader was a cool guy who was a real IBM geek, he was also not confrontational in any way.

The company employed a new IT director and in the way these things always go, he decided to stamp his authority on the data center and called in contractors for an audit of the systems. This happened to be on the week our team lead was heading off on vacation. The auditors turned up and the IT director told us to hand over all the root passwords for the systems as the auditors had scripts they needed to run. Everything went well until just before the end of normal hours, the auditors kicked off their script on a server and the terminal hung. There were mutterings, a shrug of shoulders and a comment of ""it sometimes does that, it will be a while running, just kick off the others and we can grab the results in the morning"". They then ran their scripts on the remaining servers, noted the hanging sessions, disconnected and left for the day.

Then the phones started ringing, systems were unavailable and customers were complaining. We couldn't get logged into any of the systems, all the connections we tried just timed out. The crap well and truly hit the fan and eventually a call was received from out team lead along the lines of ""my phone is going mad with alerts, what's happening?"". A brief explanation was given and we tried to gain access while he guided us on the phone. Nothing. Eventually , he said ""hang on, I will be there in around 90 minutes"". Apparently, he went to the airline desk, rescheduled the family flights, booked his family into a hotel and then hired a car to drive back to the data center. 

What had happened was the auditors had run their scripts on the Virtual IO servers on a LPAR partitioned server. In the heading of the scripts was a note specifically saying ""DO NOT RUN THIS SCRIPT ON A VIO SERVER"". The script caused a component of the VIO code to panic and drop the VIO server. Not an issue if you have redundant VIO servers, but a big issue if you run the script on every VIO server one after the other. Instead of looking at why the first session crashed, the auditors just carried on and ran their script on every VIO server in the data center. Every partition lost access to both networks and storage and we uncovered another issue which was preventing us accessing the VIO server console from the Hardware Management Console.

Our team leader left his family at an airport hotel, drove over 90 minutes from the airport and then spent a good 4 hours fixing the issues, documenting root cause before he left to go back the 90 or so minutes to the airport and fly out a day late on his vacation. I learned two things that day, first some managers put in charge of tech support teams should never have any responsibility given to them and second very few companies truly recognise the value of the quiet unassuming people who have exceptional technical expertise and dedication. The team leader left the company about a year later and to the best of my knowledge, was never rewarded for his efforts that night.",155,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF92E220>
641,pas terrible OR How I learned to stop worrying and love the French language,"This is from back when I was an exchange admin. We had just finished up migrating from lotus notes to the new O365 system. It had its hiccups and outages, but it worked for the most part. This is the story of what happened when we implemented multi-factor authentication for everyone's account. It should be noted that this office is located in a French speaking region, but the unofficial business language is English (meaning that day to day business is conducted in English). It should also be noted that I speak French like an American horse.

This is not a verbatim conversation:

User: bonjour, j'ai un problème pour me connecter à ma messagerie! je ne peux pas travailler !

Alright, I think to myself, looks like someone is having trouble accessing email. Probably because user needs to set up MFA for first time use.

Me: D'accord madamme, je peut assist avec votre problemme. SVP trouvez le procedure pour faire le MFA pour votre compte. Apres vous fait ca, vous pouvez acceder votre compte.

(ok, ma'am, i can help with that. please find the proceduce for doing MFA on your account attached. Once you do that, you can access your account.)

User: je ne sais pas comment ! (I don't know how!)

So I call the user and take control of her PC (after a lot of back and forth about quick assist codes). I do the needful and set up her MFA. She receives the SMS code and accesses her account.

User: Donc à chaque fois que je dois me connecter je dois recevoir ce code ?

Me: Oui, chaque fois vous login sur votre compte, vous doit faire le code comme ca. Mais, sur Outlook Desktop, c'est en memoire, donc ce pas necessaire chaque fois tu demarre votre PC. Seul si tu accedere par le browser ou par une autre ordinateur.

(yes, each time you log in to your account, you will have to do the code like that. But on outlook desktop, it's in memory so it's not necessary each time you start your PC. Only if you login on the browser or on another PC.)

User: C'est pas terrible.

Now THIS is where it went all wrong. To my english speaking ass, this sounds like it's not terrible. As in, it's not so bad. No, no, no. So I cut the call, thank her, etc. thinking all the while that she had accepted the outcome, and while it wasn't ideal, is was good enough. Evidently, ""Pas terrible"" actually means that it's awful. even worse than terrible.

Cut to  a few days later. My boss calls me into his office. He's a good guy, best boss I've ever had. He looks out for us and isn't afraid to tell the users when they're being stupid. He's also good at telling them that in a way that makes everyone feel good. Also, he speaks no french at all.

Boss: Alex, i got a user complaint for you. She gave a 1 out of 5 for everything. What happened?

Me: I told her about MFA and set it up for her. At the end of the call, she sounded a bit despondent about it, but said it's not too bad.

Boss: Yeah, that's what she said here too, under the comment section. ""C'est pas terrible."" oh well, I guess the 1 star rating was a mistake.",66,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF92E280>

For some background I have support responsibilities at a law firm, and anyone who knows the setting knows that paralegals are some of the most high strung people on the face of the planet.

They have also predominantly become remote workers during the pandemic and it hasn't helped the issue. This story concerns one such paralegal.

PL: Sorry, so busy today you know how it is!

SKD: No problem at all, I'll just hop in and have a look around.

PL: Yeah it took OT 2 hours to fix this the last time I had issues. I'm always having these weird problems. Do you think I could get a new prin-?

SKD: Hey, I'm not having any issues communicating with the printer from your device. Could you take a look at it and tell me if there are any errors?

PL: *getting more faint over the phone as she walks away* Oh I'm sure it's not that I just have terrible luck with tech- Oh. It looks like my kids used all the paper without telling me. Well. I guess I won't take up more of your time.

SKD: Oh man haha it happens. Have a great one!

Keep in mind we have a pretty specific policy in place that the firm-issued home use printers are not supposed to be used for non-firm related items. They're on a contract that automatically bills us for usage. The last time I helped her out she called my competence into question by encouraging me to just go and ask my predecessor how he had fixed her issue the last time.

I plugged everything in, saw the lights on the WAP start blinking as described in the manual and tried to register it to the cloud management portal, which did not work. That's when I opened a ticket with the manufacturers helpdesk.

After a bit back an forth, answering all the standard questions, we decided that he (the help desk employee) wanted to remot into my machine and have a look himself.

All danty with that, session established, he opens my browser and starts to type in the URL for the management portal, which starts with the word portal.

As soon, as he had typed the letter P, the little rat of a browser decided to spit out what it though was a nice collection of urls I may could try to access... Let's say, the portal was number 7 or 8.

There was a brief moment of silence on the line, as we both stared at the screen. He then proceeded to type in the URL and talked over it with some background informations about ports that have to be open for the WAP to communicate with the server.

In the end it was a DOA poe injector, which provided power but would not pass data.

And hats off to that support employee. I hope you are well and had a good laugh out of that. Cheers!",26,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF92E340>
644,The larger they are..,"Lurker usually. English 2nd language. Formatting should be good (on Desktop)

I started in a small-ish company (US multi-national - one of the European offices) October 2008. 

Slowly, the company grew - bought some smaller ones, got bought, bought more - and now we are all 'one'. 

Except that we are not.

Every company has their own CRM / Ticket system etc.  
And EVERY new acquisition gets their IT people taken out, and assigned to 'projects' - but the day to day support goes to people like me - except - they forget that we are not trained in X, Y and Z - as we use A, B and C , and have just understood D exists as well. 

But - we still plod on (just a side note - I am one of those that thrives in a support role - and being made a manager is my worst nightmare - as that means meetings, meetings, group calls, discussions - but zero actual work - at least, that\`s here).

So, now they think to add 'replace building infra for projectors etc' to my task as well.   
Sure, talk to vendors, explain what we have, what we need, what I want (easy to use - not having to do a 3 day immersion training to operate - and a manual in plain English or Dutch .. or even German and French - i don\`t care - but not something based on Korean, translated by a drunk Chinese person using google translate and then translated again by a Russian high as a kite before getting to English)  
So, they walk around, we talk, and in comes a reasonable quote which more or less offers what we want and need (except the manual).

Hello management - here\`s the quote - and if too high, we can do without the Barco Clickshare addition as that\`s 'luxury'.  
One of the projectors broke down - but nothing happens.

We\`re now 4 months further - and 3 managers asked me 'when will this get replaced' with increasing urgency - but.. dudes (all men) - you .. yes, YOU still haven\`t approved the budget. You know - my approval amount is $250 for purchases - the rest i need YOU to sign off and approve. 

So major meeting - 'we need all working - can you order new' - No. Still not approved - here is the email chain about this including the quote (again) for your review.  
Managed to get broken projector up - as of course nothing - so meeting went well - but we\`re now a month after the meeting and still no approval. 

How do you train management to listen for once to what the 'grunts' say?",23,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF92E3A0>
645,User didn’t know what computer she was on,"I work for a mediumish sized non-profit and I serve as their main IT guy among my other role as a technology instructor.

Because we are in the Google world (not my choice), some staff use Google Chrome Remote Desktop.

I get a call from one of my users today - u = user, m = yours truly:

U: “Hey OP, I need help getting into [database]”

M: “sure, let me email you a link so I can get remote access. Please make sure you open the email and the link on your work PC.”

U: “OK, sure, I see the email from you. I just clicked on the link and the download is starting.”

M: “OK, click the download in the bottom left corner when it’s done downloading.” (She uses chrome).

U: “it says it’s going to take 12 minutes for it to download…”

M: *me thinking “that’s odd…it’s only a few MBs and we have GB internet at that office… *“ “hey U, are you sure you clicked the link on your work PC and not your Mac at home?”

U: “Oh yes, I listened to you! I’ll let you know when it’s done..”

*about 10 minutes goes by*

U: “OK it’s done! It says ‘ConnectWise Controlxxxx.zip’

M: “…interesting. It should end in .exe. Go ahead and click on it to open it and start the program.” Thinking to myself “*yep she downloaded the Mac version*” 

*the screen opens on my end to her Mac…*

M: “uh, U, you accidentally download it onto your Mac…that’s ok though. We’ll work through this setup”. 

U: “oh I really thought I was doing this on my office PC”

*meanwhile she just had chrome open with her email and the ConnectWise link…no google chrome Remote Desktop tab.*

646,I need to fix my screen with new graphic card drivers!,"This one is hilarous, and pretty recent.

I now work as a tech support in a rather large corporate, sometimes we get the most insane crazy calls  were people try all kinds of things in order to hide their own ""wrong doings"". 

A lady called us about a screen that wasn't working properly on a laptop, she started the conversation by literally ordering me to install her a new graphics driver on her laptop.

I asked her why she thinks she needs a new graphics driver for her laptop? We usually auto-update ALL of those drivers with our usual remote service updates we perform on a regular basis as a part of the service agreement we have with all of our users, and this is usually a routine that is executed on an routinely basis by our own proprietary in-house developed updating system.

She told me to just trust her and do my goddamn job, she was pretty irate and sounded very stressed out.

As you may already know, being an IT-Tech service supporter is half psychology and half tech, and she being one of our own co-workers I tried talking casually with her to calm her down and make her feel more comfortable.

She told me to just log-on already and perform the diagnosis on her laptop and fix the screen.

I asked if she could see anything on the screen, she told me no - well yes.... there were some funny stripes here and there. I asked her if it had worked previously the day before, or if it happened suddenly or if it was just occuring now and then...

She was like, nope, it turned black this morning, and I better just do my job and remote to her laptop and do my job.

I could not see her laptop on our system, it was currently off-line. 

She asked me how come? Well I told her to connect it to the network, wifi network or similar so I could log on and service it. But she said:

How can I do that if I can't see the screen?

Maybe you can connect it to an external monitor if you have one? Well no, she didn't have that.

I asked her how come it's all of a sudden blacked out with those ""weird lines"" on it?

Well it was more like cracks in the screen she said!

...Cracks in the screen? Really? Like broken glass?

Yeah maybe...she said (sounded nervous).

Okay, then - is the screen itself broken?

She responded ""well - yeah - DUH"", can't you just install the drivers and make it work again?

I tried investigating a little further, okay - how come there's cracks on the screen?

She paused for a long time, and then told me she had ran over the laptop with her car, she placed the laptop bag behind the wheel of her car, and forgot it, and ran over it when she backed up.

...

""Facepalm"" (me ... what do you say to someone who thinks you can fix a screen that has been cracked to pieces physically, with a graphics driver?).

I told that story to my fellow IT servicedesk colleagues, they literally cracked up too. :)",48,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF92E460>
647,I'm just here to get my booster!,"I work at a university which also owns several hospitals.  We have multiple shot clinics for employees only.  I went by this afternoon to get my 2nd booster (third jab, the first one wasn't a booster, was it?) at one that also does regular flu shots. The flu shot clinic is trying something new this year, where you register online, and when you go in you scan a QR code and it does something magical and you're checked in to get the shot.  The student running the table hadn't ever met someone who hadn't scanned a QR code before.  The woman checking in hadn't ever scanned one before. She thought the student was asking her if she had gotten a code. The student was just asking her to scan the code taped to the table, but hadn't figured out that the woman didn't know how to do that. Tech-support to the rescue! 

Me: Ma'am, act like you're going to take a picture of the thing.

Her: What?

Student (tapping the code taped to the table): just scan it!

Her: What? No, I didn't get one, I just got an email.

Me: Open your camera and point it at the code.  Act like you're going to take a photo of it.

Student: Just scan it!

Her: Scan? No, I didn't get one!

Me: Unlock your phone. Ok, now open the camera.  Good. Now point the camera at the paper like you're going to photograph it.

Her (doing that): I don't think this will work...oh! 

Student (pointing toward her phone): Now click the link.

Her: What?

Student: it's a link, click it

Her (doing that): Ah, ok.

Luckily I know the programmers for this project, they'll work on the training regimen a bit more. I figured it was easier than trying to teach the student.",61,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF92E4C0>

649,Thanks for the help.......,"I received a work order this morning from a teacher:

""I plugged in my document camera but it says I need admin rights to use it.""

Ok, the software has to be installed and only I can do that. Fine. I go to the classroom. No one is in there. No camera either. Teacher walks in and I ask about the camera she says it's in the library (huh?). She's an older woman and not great with technology. I go to the librarian. We're both confused. She gives me one of the many document cameras. I go back to the classroom and there she is - The Meddler (cue super villain music) - sitting next to the teacher that submitted the order. This teacher thinks she's in the IT department. She always tries to fix things or ask for passwords etc. that she shouldn't be doing or have access to. She can't simply submit a work order and allow me to do my job. I'm sure she wouldn't like it if I tried to teach her class.

Meddler: Oh hi, IT guy! (she always says that. So annoying) I installed the software and the camera still won't work.

Me (knowing that it's impossible to install with her login): Yeah you aren't able to install software I have to login in with admin credentials or mine.

Meddler: Well, I figured that but I tried anyway. I downloaded the software though.

Me (in my head): You want a damn medal?

Older teacher: I'm sorry. I thought she already got it ready. She said she would take care of it.

Me: Who submitted the work order?

Older teacher (looking embarrassed): She (Meddler) did, but she told me that she'd handle it.

Me: Not your fault. You're all set.

650,"I don't want a new screen, I need my icons.","This is some years ago, but it's still funny and I'll never forget it so here is my story.

I used to work at a ad agency with lots of POS and Key account managers, I was their graphics artist and also their IT-Tech supporter.

One day our boss decided to change the entire interior of the office, everyone was happy about that, the company was doing well and we wanted to change the entire interior to something fresh and nice, you know - as a kickoff to our new success and prosperity.

Ofc. my job was to make sure our IT equipment was top notch, new computers, new cabling, new screens and all.

Most of our staff isn't very IT savvy at all, and this one lady in particular wasn't very tech oriented, but very stylish and knew her fashion. In fact she was a rich kid from the richest family in our country at the time, but that's kinda besides the point. 

I was about to give her a brand new wide-screen monitor and she yelled at me ""WHAT ARE YOU DOING?"".

Err, I'm about to give you a new shiny bigger and better monitor.

She said: Are you CRAZY? Do you know how many years it has taken me to organize my desktop icons? I have a ton of contact information, PDF files and images I need on my desktop.

I tried to explain to her that they would still be there, it's just the screen I'm replacing.

She looked at me like I was the crazy one and kept on yelling at me: You idiot, I have all my shortcuts and documents well organized on that screen, if you replace that screen I will have to redo years of work.

Calmly yet again I tried explaining to her the concept of computers and windows...that those Icons and shortcuts are on her Windows installation on the computer itself, and that the Desktop shortcuts and contents will be untouched.

She kept on yelling at me, Untouched? You're quite literally replacing my screen were the Icons are, are you so lost you don't get that? 

My co-workers heard this and they had to literally crawl under their ""IRL"" desktops in order to hide the fact they were literally dying from laughter, I was a bit shook by her erratic behaviour so I couldn't even laugh, I tried thinking in laymens terms and imagine from her point of view (with zero computer knowledge) how to explain it to her in a way she would ""get it"".

We ended up letting her keep her monitor, there were no way to explain to her this, she just wouldn't understand. She really held on to the monitor as I was going to demo for her that the icons would still be there, but she kept blocking it like her life depended on it.

652,'But it doesn't have a second tray',"It was that time of the multi-year cycle. Time for new printers. That time where a disproportionate amount of the IT budget is spent on big, expensive, bulky printers even for the departments that for some reason have desk printers on top of departmental ones because enough of them complained to the right people that they got desk printers for 'workflow efficiency'.

Anyway, per usual the behemoth industrial upright printers were being replaced with very slightly smaller behemoths that had new shiny software and a sleeker more modern look. The printer makes/models/specs were cleared with all department heads before ordering and were exact matches for the previous printers spec wise except a higher PPM and lacking a finisher add-on that the went unused in the previous cycle (With few enough exceptions that our graphics printer could take care of it)

Everything went remarkably smoothly, the new drivers deployed without a hitch, and everyone was happy.... Except one department.

This department called and complained almost immediately that 'it didn't have a second tray'. The printers have the same number of paper trays including 1 bypass so there was a bit of confusion on our part. You see, the lack of additional trays would definitely be an issue since many departments need multiple paper sizes available at the same time without swapping. However, we double checked and all the trays were present and accounted for..... Until we were shown by the complainee that the old printer had 2 **output** trays. One in the body and one on the finisher. This was a purely cosmetic second tray that came out of the finisher if booklets were being made and had no bearing on the amount of prints/copies the printer could process. Copies would also come out of the finisher tray but only after a normal print job completed. We of course let them know that the lack of a second tray doesn't affect print speed and that their copies/prints would come out at even faster speed but that didn't seem matter.

""It used to work that way"", the most dangerous phrase in the organization, was brought out. Then my bosses boss was contacted and they complained. We made our case, they made their case, **and......**

Several thousand more dollars were spent on a finisher add-on so they could have their paper come out in 2 different places.",47,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF92E6A0>
653,I don't want a new one...,"I'll keep it short, if I can.

We had just returned to our place of work after over a year due to social distancing.

A user came to my office complaining that their laptop wouldn't connect to the internet or print, it turns out this machine hadn't been upgraded to Win 10 prior to the lockdown and was therefore no longer compatible with my internet filtering system and our hold print system.

I explained this to the user and said not to worry I can back up your data and upgrade your CURRENT machine to Win 10 and let you carry on as normal.

I was backed up on jobs and explained I wouldn't be able to do this for at least a few days, they are more than welcome to borrow one of 30 brand new laptops in the meantime.

The user scoffed and said they want their current one as they don't ""like the look"" of the much newer machines. I shrugged and said suit yourself.

2 days later

User AND their management come into the office raging saying they haven't been able to work for 2 whole days, I was actually quite taken back by this as I hadn't been used to face to face stupidity for some time.

654,"Remove our admin permissions, we will wait for the grief to come pouring down from above","This happened about 20 years ago, as I was starting my IT career. The organisation I was working for was an early adopter, and had just rolled out Windows 2000, and Delegated Control was still a good idea a long way off being implemented. It was discussed making this happen by the Sys Admins, but not implemented to allow the Help Desk to have granulated permissions, but this had not been worked out yet. 

I was still on the help desk, and worked with Alec. Alec had been around, since I think Noah was building the ark, and possibly handed him the hammer when needed, so Alec knew everyone and had interesting stories to tell. If Alec is on here, he can tell his own stories. 

The computer corporation that the organisation had hired to manage 2nd and 3rd level escalations above help desk decided that the lowly help desk peons (Alec and I) could not have domain administration permissions any more, as we were doing the work and taking cases off them, that meant they could not justify as many man hours they were charging our organisation. So on Wednesday night our accounts were removed from the elevated permissions, without notifying us. Possibly our managers were notified, but not what the implications were. 

Here comes the Compliance, see all we could do now, was catch and despatch, nothing else. Simply take the call, and log it into the helpdesk system, saying someone needed their account unlocked to be able to work, someone else wanted to change their password, as they had forgotten their password, and another person needed access to a specific folder on the file server/s. This is all run of the mill level one tasks that takes seconds to complete. However not this Thursday, see the computer corporation that day needed to do their weekly team building meeting, that I was not privy to, not working for them, however I am sure they were told how much extra money they would be making doing all these extra cases. 

Alec started after me, as he then had the later finish, so I explained our lack of access now, and that we would have to simply catch and dispatch calls now, with the computer corporation doing all the work. This is boring and what gives help desk roles a really bad name. Alec wanted to go our managers to get this changed immediately, however I convinced him to comply with the corporation’s diktat. We would allow the people directly affected by not being able to work to complain to their managers, then they would complain to ours, so we don’t look like we are being difficult to the computer corporation new stance, whom we had to get along with. 

Ohh yes they did complain, the manager for computer corporation got hauled out of their team meeting to fix things up, so we could do our work and our colleagues could then do theirs. When their manager asked why we did not say these cases were backing up, we replied we could not change / unlock passwords, and they were busy in their meeting and we were asked previously not to disturb them. 

Petty I know, but we did get our admin rights back before lunchtime. Also now things are massively changed and domain admin rights are not handed out so fast. But this was early days of Windows 2000.

Me: The father won't return school property. Call the cops

Librarian returns to the office looking very confused. She returns a few minutes later.

Librarian: Well how do we resolve this?

Me: Jeez. Tell the father to bring the laptop to the school. You can sign something for him absolving him of responsibility for it. Then the mother can pick it up from here.

Principal (who has now walked in to hear this): Yeah I guess we can do that. I was just wanting to get another laptop for the student.

Context is this: my friend 'Susan' is a young woman working in a male-dominated industry, in a job she describes as ""between sales and tech"". She often trains the sales people on how to use some of the software, this story is from one of those times. 

Susan was working with a guy from sales 'Jack', who has previously requested to get on calls with Susan for help with ""you really shouldn't need help with this"" kind of issues. Jack requested a call with Susan for help with a particular software tool (the actual purpose of the software is irrelevant). The software in question had a 'profile' section for the user, and the profile section allowed the user to upload and crop a profile image. 

Jack had some issue with the cropping tool, asked Susan to get on a call to help. Susan does the normal troubleshooting steps, gets to the point where she can see the actual error message, and here's what she finds

> ERROR: crop selection must fit within the image area

Yes, the issue is what you'd think it was - Jack tried to 'crop' the whole image and then some -  and Jack wanted help understanding the error.

658,10 feet is too far to walk.,"I am a member of a small team that is the final line of technical support for my company's dealers.  We also conduct all the training for dealerships around the country.  We are generally supposed to be used as a last resort.  

One of our biggest goals is to increase dealer independence by teaching them to use their resources and knowledge to arrive at a solution themselves.  We have devoted a lot of time and effort towards this.  However some people just treat us as the easy button to makes all problems disappear.  This happens with varying degrees of shamelessness.  

Today a tech called in with a quick question. It's always just a quick question. Even the 2 hour calls were just ""quick"" questions.  A customer wanted to set a controller from Mode 2 back to Mode 1.  The answer is 3 button presses.  

I've been to their shop in person.  I know they have several manuals for this controller scattered all over the place.  The answer is in the first few pages.  I also know they have this exact controller mounted on a wall of their shop to act as a sales demo.  He could have walked across the room, hit the menu key and had his answer.  But that isn't convenient enough.  

It was a tragedy deserving of a opera. The controller was 10 feet away and the manual was probably sitting next to it.  Oh the humanity.  It's like a starving man being chained just millimetres away from a bountiful banquet.  That trove of knowledge forever out of reach.

WAC: Oh ho ho you bet, but not only will it not load, we are getting an error!

&#x200B;

Me:  Well that's good sir, it should point us towards the issue, can I get remote into your computer?  Teamviewer is our preferred method.

&#x200B;

WAC: Nope, I just need it to work.

&#x200B;

Me: ....Um okay, do you not have internet there or is there another reason I cannot remote in?

&#x200B;

WAC:  Look we don't do that here, I just need a fix for this so that I can get back to work.

&#x200B;

Me:  (big sigh while muted)  Okay sir, I can try and talk you through a few things, or if you have IT there I can talk to them, it may be easier that way.

&#x200B;

WAC:  Just talk me through it, I'm the most knowledgeable one around here for this computer so I can do it.

&#x200B;

Me:  You bet, the first thing I need you to do is go to our application's log folder and pull up the log from today.

&#x200B;

WAC:  And just WHERE am I supposed to FIND THAT?!

&#x200B;

Me (Deep breath, don't get mad, goosfraba, he's just probably got some pressure to get this fixed): Okay sir, follow my instructions (proceeds to tell him how to get to that directory I need him inside of), now do you see the log files?

&#x200B;

WAC:  Hold on guy I can't go that fast, I'm almost done writing it down.

&#x200B;

Me:  ...What?  What are you writing down?

&#x200B;

WAC:  The instructions obviously, how else am I supposed to get there.

&#x200B;

Brain.exe stops working.  Instead of just following what I told him to do he felt the need to write it all down so he could... do what I told him to do.

&#x200B;

WAC:  Okay I'm there, what next.

&#x200B;

Me:  Open the log file dated from today and tell me what the bottom line in the text file says.

&#x200B;

WAC:  It says server 10.10.10.10 not reachable, please try again.

&#x200B;

Me:  Okay, do you know how to ping the server?

&#x200B;

WAC:  ....Yes....

&#x200B;

Me: .... Okay... do it...

&#x200B;

WAC:  I can't, it won't let me.

&#x200B;

Me:  Why not sir?

&#x200B;

WAC:  There is no ping installed.  Look can't you just get this working already?

&#x200B;

Me:  Get your IT now, we can't continue without them.

&#x200B;

Finally, IT gets involved, pings the server, wow much shock, ping does not respond.  They figured out that the network cable connected to the application server needed to be replaced, and once it did everything came back online.  All the while I am talking to the On-site IT guy, I hear WAC in the background talking a bunch of smack like some weird world star hype man.  Once we were nearing completion I asked the IT guy if they blocked outside network access or what the reason was I couldn't remote in.  He was confused because they have Teamviewer operational downloaded on the desktop.",36,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF92E940>
660,Millimeters Matters.,"So, I'm a software developer, working mainly with POS and CRM solutions. Our software prints label for products, mailing addresses, invoice controle, etc. Everyone that has worked with Label Printers Know that they are ticklish to configure.

We have a customer thats needs to print labels to go along sales orders. We ask for the dimensions of the label. The customer said: 110 mm width, 70mm height. We ask: the height is from top to botton of THE LABEL. ""Yes."" comes the reply.

Well, we know that the printer she uses only accepts until 108mm labels, so we configure the width, design the label, print and the printer writes one label, jumps one, printer another, jumps one...

We ask: are you sure that the height of THE LABEL is 70mm. ""Yes"" she replies, ""I measured it myself!"". We look at the configuration of the printer, look at the design: everything ok. Try to print again, same result.

""Are you sure of the height?"", we ask again. ""YES!!!"" comes the reply.

""Send a phot of the label with a ruler over, please."". She send the photo. The label is 65 mm tall, with 3mm gap to the next label. She was measuring from the top of one label to the top of the other, but the printer needs to find the gap between labels, so when it finished printing the label, it go looking for the next gap, that were on label ahead!

661,"""Think you need to label these cables.""","Not a bad call to be fair, just someone who needed a little bit of help.

I work in the technical call center for broadband/tv/phone provider, so I get customer's calling in where I help them resolve their issue be it troubleshooting, updating them on an order, or getting them an engineer or their situation raised if its beyond what I can help them with.

Got a call from a lady who was a bit confused, her internet was going live that day and was told it would be on by now, but she had no connection. A bit odd but sometimes we advise them to wait until midnight to see if it comes on, but just to be sure the job had been completed I checked out database and what do you know- it IS completed. After I agreed with her it SHOULD be on by now she then commented; ""I am using my old wires for the new router, it did come with new wires but I wasn't sure what to do with them.""

Think I found the problem. I asked her to describe the wires, helped guide her into plugging the right ones in the right sockets and then her router finally kicked in. Even ran a couple of tests to make sure the speeds looked good and there were no other faults and sent her some links in case she ever had any trouble and needed some extra help. She had a laugh about it and commented, ""I think you need to label these cables for people like me!"" Let her know that it was nothing to worry about, sometimes you'll get tech and it comes with so many things you don't know whats what. I've been there.

We even ended up having a good conversation about her plans to just settle in front of the telly all weekend to binge while I ran those extra tests. All in all she was cheerful and bright throughout the call, couldn't of asked for a better customer.",60,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF92EA00>

I assist employees and associates with our software, and if they bought a computer from us, their hardware. Users can bring their own hardware, but require being enrolled in a machine configuration, which brings SEC requirements. 

Call comes in 5 minutes before the end of my shift. User states they are in college and need to setup proctoring software for school. 

Me: Yours Truly

Karen: Not her real name

This is abridged. 

* *Opening, pull them up, etc*
* Karen: I need to make sure I can run proctoring software on my laptop by tomorrow.
* Me: Proctoring software usually requires deep system access, and is categorically banned by our compliance team.
* Karen: I don't care, how do I make sure I can run this?
* Me: Was the system purchased from us?
* Karen: No. 
* Me: So it's your personal system, and you want to run non-compliant software, while it's configured to access PII?
* Karen: Yes. I've done this before, I just need to know if it meets the requirements. I demand you remote in and look over this list and tell me if this is going to work or not. 
* *Remote in, read document*
* Me: This says you may not use a laptop with a touch screen under any circumstances. Does this have a touch screen?
* Karen: Of course! I don't use a mouse or the mousepad^((touchpad))
* Me: Then, based on the requirements, you cannot use it. 

Now, here's the problem. I'm not allowed to hang up. It's an immediately failure of my quality form. At this point, I'm 5 minutes past my shift. 

* Karen: *rants for literally 24 minutes about how useless our systems are, why she never would buy from us, demands we make this computer work for her test, pleads that it should be allowed, and gets slowly angrier as time progresses*
* Me: *mhmm, ok, I hear you, alright, noted...*
* Karen: Are you going to help me or not. Right now, you're not being helpful AT ALL!
* Me: I have no control over your test or the software, you will want to bring up your concerns with your proctor. I can only tell you that it is against compliance to run it while the system is configured to connect to our network, and their document says your system is barred from use to begin with. 
* Karen: Well fuck you. I'm going to use it anyway since it worked before. You're fucking useless.

Now I can hang up. 

Karen has now wasted my time, cursed at me, and called into question my abilities as a tech.

There is something I do have control over.

* Me: *Email the compliance team about the pending violation so they can surprise audit her system, and include the time I saw in the email for her test.*

TLDR: Karen calls internal helpdesk for a question we don't handle, argues against the 'it won't work' answer, makes me stay late, and cursed and me and called me useless.

664,No I won't use that computer fix this one,"**Background:** I was a student technician for a satellite campus of a larger university. We were in the middle of implementing a new print system and said system was having inexplicable, intermittent print errors on all student PC's at every level of the university. The problem, once it happened, had no fix it until it decided to work again later. The individuals above my head were furiously working on a solution but the only consistent work around we had was simply to move the student to another PC.

**Setup:** I had just clocked in and notice there was a 45 minute old ticket put in from a student account. I ask my supervisor if that issue had been taken care of and was told no. As that was the only open ticket myself and the other student tech who also just clocked in decided to walk over to the location in another building and found for some reason the student was still there and they were... furious.

**Incident:** I do remember explaining that I had just clocked in and there had been a brief lapse of coverage for low level requests but the wait had obviously soured their mood. They then showed me the print error pop-up. I explained that this issue was happening intermittently across our new print system and I couldn't fix it on that PC. I offered to put the document on a flash drive and walk over to the lab across the hallway where a different computer could be used to release the job.

That was their breaking point. Being asked to physically move was apparently the last straw  they started yelling in my face (the other tech had escaped at this point having seen where it was going). HOW DARE I TELL THEM TO MOVE TO ANOTHER PC I SHOULD BE ABLE TO FIX THIS PC IN FRONT OF THEM THEY PAY THEIR STUDENT IT DUES THEY KNOW WHAT KIND OF SUPPORT THEY ARE ENTITLED TO THIS IS HORRIFIC MY BOSS WILL BE NOTIFIED THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE.

At this point I kinda crack and start laughing hysterically.

Believe it or not despite working around 4 years of retail prior to this point I had never ran into this level of... whatever it was. This felt like something straight out of a reddit post which just made the individual more angry. I then take a second to compose myself and then apologized and calmly re-explain that the issue is out of my hands and is affecting all PC's we have been under a lot of stress from the issue recently and the person just left.

**Afterthoughts:** The threat was actually followed through and the head of the IT department had a formal complaint filed against me.... which was laughed off as the other tech was an eye witness (from a bit down the hall) and could back up my side of the story.",10,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF92EB20>

The hospital contracts are by far the biggest, most frustrating, & most volatile when it comes to the types of characters we get on the inbound lines - and this short story is from one of those healthcare organizations, but it isn't anything irritating (really, a shock to me lol)

666,No I'm not going to make changes AFTER the Factory acceptance test was already done,"I work as a software engineer for automation technologies. My team handles everything from the automation software (TIA, Step7) the user interface/HMI, SCADA servers, the IPCs and other smaller things needed like protocols, OPC-UA etc. 

Last week I drove on site and was basically on site tech support to help with everything they needed and help woth the factory acceptance trsts. Within that week I racked up 160 pages of paperwork that prove and make sure everything is correct and works as intended. It's a GxP environment so we make sure all documents are completed correctly and all certificates are valid. Afterwards they signed everything, stating that my official support job has ended and I'll only be staying on site for another two weeks in case of an emergency.

Today I get this call: (C = customer)

> C: Good morning OP! I'm calling you because I have a request regarding the software and machine

> Me: Good morning. What can I help you with?

> C: Our engineers had the idea to implement an ultrasonic device to the production line to help the side feeders work better. Can you implement that for the final site acceptance test next week?

> Me: .. Wait. That wasn't in scope was it? My boss didn't tell me about it. When did you discuss it?

> C: Oh we haven't done that yet. I just wanted to call you in advance since you're already on site right now!

> Me: So you want me to change all the documents, implement the ultrasonic device in our software, add it to the SCADA server, change the profibus and PLC adresses, test it and re-certify everything for GMP standards. Until next week? You know today is thursday right?

> C: Exactly! It's only one device so it should be fast to implement it. You dont have to test the rest and just stick the changes of the documents as an appendix to the current version.

> Me:  .. No. That's not how that works.

> C: What do you mean? Its such a small change I could do it myself if I had the time.

Then I spend the next 30 minuzes explaining that   1) This was never discussed. I would need an official request for it, wich means I would get paid extra for it.   2) the documents have to be signed by multiple people, across 4 different companies who work on the project. Good luck getting a hold of them within a single day.   3) Its impossible to make software changes and then test them WITHOUT having the actual device on site. I physically cannot test the fuctionality of buttons that are not connected to anything. 


I'm sick of customers and their ""ideas"". Especially last minute changes or requests that would take way longer than they think...


Edit: Just purely going by what I'm capable of on my own, I could easily implement all the changes within a week. Then would need another week for documentations, signatures and certificates.

One of the things my current employer decided to do during the period when ***the whole world was on fire*** was to bring forward the merging of two divisions. It made sense that the divisions would merge, they performed technical tasks for customers, both ad-hoc and contracted service work, emergency call outs and scheduled maintenance.  
What made less sense was that I was pushed into the Supervisor Role - a purely administrative position. This made little sense, as I was the only person with the training, experience, and importantly, the certification that allowed me to carry out certain scheduled works. Ensuring this work is continuously up to date is important, as it provides a certain amount of legal cover for our customers. As a result, I was stuck trying to complete a 100% administrative office-bound role while ALSO trying to complete a 100% field-based role.

As you might imagine, this did not work - as good as I may be, I cannot be in two places at once.

However, after I (repeatedly) brought this up with my Manager (Regional), and his Manager (National), I eventually managed to drive home my point.

A scant six months later, precisely nothing had happened. In mid-November, the pre-Christmas workload was ramping up hard, so I booked some leave for late January through to mid February. It was only a couple of weeks, I reasoned. It's more than two months, that's plenty of notice, I reasoned.

January finally arrived, and two days before my much anticipated leave was due to start, I noticed that it had not yet been approved. I emailed the Regional Manager, as he was the only one that could approve my leave, and sure enough, a few hours later, I received the email notification that my leave had been approved in the system.  
On Friday, I set an Out of Office message on my emails, changed my voicemail to reflect the date of my return, and turned my phone off. I did not turn it back on until the day I returned to work.

I was intrigued. I was concerned. I was somewhat dubious about my prospects for continued employment.

And I drafted a reply.

As such - having never left his vehicle or begun barricading off a work area - he did not complete the form to start work. However it appears that this form was included in the monthly roll up, despite it's incomplete status.  
> Normally, such a form would be identified by the Supervisor - myself - during the end of month process before it is sent to {Affected Customer}.

An Out of Office email was sent TO YOU, to remind you that I was on annual leave; the text of which reads ""I will not return until at least February 15"", so I did not see your original email (dated Feb 1) with it's request to review these forms by Feb 3 until today (Feb 15).

The silence was so deafening that I can only assume I was removed from whatever reply emails were sent.

The crap raining down from the Regional Manager only intensified after that. Finally, a mere nine months after he had originally promised me a replacement, the National Manager sent me an email that they had finally begun advertising for a new technician! Once the hiring process was completed, I would no longer need to ever leave the office again.

I picked up the phone, and told the National Manager not to bother hiring a new technician. The Regional Manager was discussed, in depth. The words ""constructive dismissal"" were used.  
I officially stepped down from the Supervisor role and returned to full time technician status.

This morning, I received an urgent breakdown call. It was an older piece of equipment - older than some of the staff that operate it - so sudden catastrophic failure was definitely not outside the realm of possibility. There are also legal obligations to have said equipment running, so while not necessarily critical to operation, it was important to get it fixed or replaced ASAP.  
I raced out to the customer's site, and quickly diagnosed the issue.

As I turned the power back on at the wall, one of the staff watching me spoke up.

> Site Staff (SS): Is that all it was?

> ME: It's back up now, so it looks like it!

> SS: I'm so sorry! It must be so annoying to get called out for an emergency when it's actually something so simple!

671,Lady waiting over a YEAR for TV box installation. I get the case.,"So since April I've started working for a TV/Broadband/Phone company after being made redundant and work on the tech team. We work with anything from installations, troubleshooting and upgrading services. Basically if you have a problem with any of those, I help you sort it.

So it was 8am and the first call of the day is a lady who is absolutely furious, at first it wasn't clear what the problem was but after reassuring her I wanted to help and that I'd look at the notes on her account and she can fill me in on what's been missed she calmed down a bit.

A year ago this lady paid over £100 to get a new TV box installed, only it had never been installed. From the notes and what the lady was telling me, every time an engineer went out they had an excuse as to why they weren't able to install it that day; ""Oh we don't have the right ladder"" ""We aren't trained for this kind of install"" ""We could try and access it from the other property, but we're not insured for that"".   
Why this lady had been left hanging like this made no sense to me and I promised her I'd get to the bottom of it. She already HAD TV services with us, but the upgraded box install was the problem and she was also a carer for a family member so had enough stresses, so I told her ""Don't worry about calling us, I will call you and text you updates.""

The next month was me giving her consistent updates, running around to managers and more experienced staff on install procedures to get the specific ladders and how to get the lady her money back because I couldn't re-submit an install without taking a payment. There was no override.

Eventually I figured it out; I called a specialist team to let them know about the property and have it marked so they knew exactly what equipment they'd need ahead of time. My manager got in touch with higher ups who confirmed we could give her the money back, then I could agree the date. I called the customer and told her the situation, we put the wheels in motion and I triple checked the order had all the flags it had needed and updated her each week before the install to let her know it was still going ahead and there were no delays.

The day after the install I called her to ask her if everything had gone okay; she was so grateful and said the new engineers we sent were so lovely and made her feel validated in all the problems she'd had. She thanked me for helping her and said ""I wish I could meet you and give you a hug"". I told her that I was glad to get her sorted and that knowing I'd helped fix things was more than enough for me.

So whenever I have a bad day or a customer is yelling at me that I'm terrible at my job and don't know what I'm doing (which happens), I always think about this lady and how much what I did meant for her and her family.",143,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF92EDC0>
672,"""You got a 38 week pregnant woman's blood pressure up for no reason""","This one happened to me several months ago, and I will never forget it. (Mesh network poster here)

I work in level 1 support, and I reached out to a user for an issue with Outlook. Fixed that up in no time, and they then she proceeded to ask for help with another issue. The user claimed there was an option in Outlook that was no longer there, and argued a bit with me when I explained that it was gone due to an update. No biggie. Then a firm-wide issue occurred with one of our programs, and she continue to message me. I was trying to leave for a medical appointment when this happened with one of our ""programs"" we use, and it will be referred to as such. Each new line also represents the user sending a different message, and please keep in mind I would take a few minutes to respond each time. It went like this after:

Me: Me, User: User

User: Okay, now I am getting this error ""send picture of not being able to log into an application""

Me: I can have a look into the Outlook issue ""as I hadn't answered right away"" and get back to you 

User: It really isn't a big deal 

Don't worry about it. It was just there this morning and now isn't, I thought it was an easy fix

but why am I getting that error above? I am confused what it means and it keeps popping up

Me: I'm not sure, everyone has it

User: ok

User: Wait.... is that error connected to my ""program we use""

I have been on the ""program we use"" all day

Me: It doesn't appear to be

User: It is. I had assumed it was Outlook because it came up just after you got it opened. 

But now I can't get on the ""program we use"" lol

Me: It is not related to ""program we use"", it's a firmwide issue

User: Ok. it comes up when I try to open the ""program"" though

when you were on my computer my ""program"" disconnected, and no when I try to open it I get that error

Please note at this point She just keeps messaging me, when I'm now leaving for my doctor's appointment, so my patience ran out a bit here, so I came off a bit more ""straight"" than I would've liked. 

Me: Yes, there is a firm-wide issue with our company programs, and it not to the ""program"" only. I cannot keep talking about this as I have to leave for a medical appointment. Please put in a ticket or give the the support team a call as it is being worked on for EVERYONE in our firm right now. 

User: ok - sorry I wasn't trying to be difficult

I was just trying to determine what I needed to do/what I was asking for 

you didn't have to be rude. as you are IT and this is your job

don't bother helping me again. thanks.

673,Someone told me to post this previous comment here: flashback 90s tech," 

In the late 90s and early 2000s OEM car company distributed it worldwide diagnostics system tool used for  repairing vehicles in their dealerships using Windows 98 as the OS. (Not  NT and defintely not a commercial grade OS, but I digress).

Whenever  a technician in the field had an issue with the software(which was  often), the first thing Tier 1 support would suggest was to reload the  software from disk.

The designed,  approved, and published correct loading process was : start up the  system and boot off the disk...watch the % completion bar on the  screen...After it is at 10%( 15 minute process), perform a hard  (Ctrl,Alt,Del) reset,...then reboot the system and load it again. It had  to do with disk partitioning as I recall, but that just seemed like the  laziest fix or initial software implementation I had ever seen up to  that time...

Another doozy from  that product: The portable PC had a problem with batteries not lasting  very long on each charge, since they were often temporarily disconnected  from their base during use. The fix was to create a battery  reconditioning program that promised to return the battery to its  longest lasting state, and took about 2 hours to run. SO far, so good.  Some proactive thinking technicians across the nation decided to perform  this every night so their precious and irreplaceable tool (of which  there were only a few in  each dealership for all the techs to share)  would be ready for max performance the next morning...a few months  later, all of these systems started dying and their expensive batteries  had to be replaced, as no one realized that these so-called smart  batteries would only allow themselves to be recharged 2500 times before  they would commit suicide and refuse any further attempt at recharging.  The original manufacturer of the battery packs made a killing off of  supplying the tens of thousands of battery packs to OEM car company Tier 1  diagnostics tool supplier. The Tier 1? not so much as OEM car company made them eat  the cost",21,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF92EE80>
674,"Apparently we took it, even though its been working for months","This just happened.

A customer called because their wireless mouse they bought from us stopped working. I asked if they did the standard stuff etc etc and then asked them to unplug and plug back in their USB receiver. They can't find it. So I say to just bring in the computer and we can check in out in here.

They bring it in and its actually a keyboard and mouse combo. I have a look and theres no USB receiver in their computer or in the storage slot in the mouse. I let her know this.

Me: Me

DL: Distressed Lady

CT: Callout Tech

The convo goes like this (shortened, as she was going in circles repeating herself making me as well):

Me: There's no receiver here.

DL: I just brought it in like you said too.

Me: I understand that-

DL, cuts me off: BABE! I didn't touch it!!

(yes she got this upset this early into the conversation)

Me: It's not in the slot in the mouse so-

DL, interrupting me: The mouse has always looked like that!! Your CT must have done that! 

Me: Well, thats because he would have taken it out to plug it into your PC. It should look like this. I was just saying as-

DL, interrupting me again: I am the only one that uses my office. No one else touched it! Your CT came out in June and set it all up so he must've taken it.

Me: Has the mouse worked since he came out?

DL: Yes. It's worked all the way up until two days ago!!

Me: Then it was set up correctly with the receiver installed because it wouldn't work without it. He could not have taken it.

DL, freaks out and starts raising her voice: I swear on God that I am the only one in my office!! He must've taken it!

Me: He couldn't have if it's been working. What did you unplug from your computer to bring it in?

\*gestures to the VGA port, power and she unplugged her printer\*

Me: What about the keyboard? Was that working?

DL: Listen to me!! I just picked up the keyboard and put it in the box to bring here like YOU said! I don't know what it was doing! 

Me: Okay then. Hmm could it have been bumped out then? 

DL: \*presses her hands on either side of her head\* YOU ARE NOT UNDERSTANDING ME! I DIDN'T TOUCH ANYTHING!!

Me, shocked: Okay! Well its not in the mouse and its not in the computer. So it's not here. If you didn't-

DL, cuts me off again: Your Manager told me to get this in the first place!! At least test it on your computer!

Me: I can't test it without the USB receiver. 

This goes on for several minutes, me trying any way I can to get her to understand and it just repeating like this . Until I offer to call the CT (who is on a call out) and she accepts and said she'll come back later.

I did speak to the CT and he plugged it into the computer. I was hoping by some miracle there was a USB port on her monitor that he used so I didn't have to repeat this again. RIP. She's coming back later today and I'm going to get one of the male techs to explain it as they can be more stern then me.",17,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF92EEE0>
675,I have a workaround for that...,"Short one but just had to share it,  I work as Sysadmin for a bank and provide over the phone support for some of the systems we administrate. Get a call about a temperamental system that stops responding and crashes if you mess around with it while it's loading a report.

Me: ""Okay, have you tried not minimising it while it's loading?""

User: \* ignoring me\* ""Anyway I want this logged a fault, I've got screenshots and my details if you want to take them down.""

Me: ""It's not really a fault and not something we'd log. Please just don't use the minimise button while it's loading...""

Edit: Just to clarify this is a very old banking system, no active development and the process to replace it would be long and painful for how little it's used. It's much easier to tell users to not mess with it while it's loading and this isn't an issue for most users.

user: i would like to have my screen on the wright side to be the 1. can you help? Please?

\*sends screenshot of display settings, screen 1 is on the left, 2 on the right

me:  so right now your screens are backwards? (2 is physically on the right and 1 is physically on the left)? 

User:  yes i think 

Me:  ok, so you should be able to click and drag your screens on that diagram so that one is on the left and 2 is on the right, then they should match up with the physical locations of the screens 

\*sends me the same screenshot, 1 on the left, 2 on the right

User: This is how it is now

Me:  Ah ok, so you can drag and drop those boxes to match where the screens are in reality. I'd advise to click 'identify' so that you are sure which screen is which first, then if the one on the right is 1, drag the number 1 screen to the right of the number2 screen in that diagram. 

User: Ok  
User: It's not working

Me: you can't click and drag the screen? 

User: Can you take control and do it for me?

&#x200B;

I then proceed to take control of her PC and note that display settings is closed. I then open settings, go into the display settings and click identify. 1 is on the right and 2 on the left.

&#x200B;

Me: ok when i clicked identify, was 1 on the left screen and 2 on the right screen?

User:  yes 

&#x200B;

I click and drag 1 so that it is on the left of 2, to match the physical location of her screens.

Me: so that ought to do it, I just dragged your screens in the disploy\[sic\] diagram to the correct positions 

User:  but i want the screen 1 to the right side please 

Me:  but when you click 'identify, is screen 1 on the right or left? 

User:  1 is now at the left side 

Me:  so on the diagram, 1 needs to also be on the left. 

User:  so we can not do anithing\[sic\] ? 

Me:  I don't understand, why do you want 1 to be on the right? 

User:  that is how i am confortable\[sic\]

&#x200B;

I had to explain to her that this is how it needs to be if she wants to be able to move her mouse around from screen to screen in the way that they are meant to be.

679,Mesh Network Gets returned,"First time poster, go easy folks!

I worked as a ""technician"" that would work in shop and be sent out to a customer's address to help with IT related things. Sometimes this would entail fixing an issue or setting something up. One day I get a ticket stating the customer needs a mesh network setup, and I'm provided no other information. After waiting outside for around 25 minutes, the customer rolls into the driveway, and we get down to business. The conversation was something like this:

Customer: Hey, sorry for being late. I need a mesh network hooked up because the internet is too slow. 

Me: What exactly is slow? I'd like to get an idea of what exactly you are noticing. 

Customer: Well, we can't watch 4K movies, it just buffers the entire time on the Television. 

I take a speed test and the speed is some of the slowest I've seen, it was around a 2mbps down, and a .7 up. I advised her of this, and strongly recommended to speak with her ISP. I told her that the mesh network is mainly for coverage, and wouldn't make any noticeable difference on the speed. I mentioned she could return the item, and if needed we could have another look after the ISP had a look at their equipment. The customer apparently came back to the shop, and reamed out the sales team as she was sold an item she didn't need, and word got back to me and bingo. Let go. I always felt I did the right thing, but according to the company I lost the sale, oops.

1. Remove the wiring going to any case mounted USB devices
2. Super glue the logitech dongle into the back USB ports and block the rest in. (Out of an unusual amount of wisdom the company only buys USB brand mice/keyboards so this plan will actually work)
3. Install a hidden USB port inside of the case to connect USB mass storage devices to if needed for IT needs.
4. Install a USB charging stations so everyone has at least 2 open USB ports on their desk for charging Phones/smart watches.

682,I hit “reset password” but I am not receiving any reset emails. I have tried nothing and am out of ideas!,"This is the freshest, hot-off-the-press story I've ever posted; this happened just 5 minutes ago. It took my brain a solid 60 seconds to reboot since it needed some firmware updates to handle the new levels of either laziness or ignorance consistently displayed by my $users. Love them.

So I got a simple ticket on Friday (from my least favorite $user <3): 

***Is this email legit or no???***

It was a phishing test email sent out by our SysAdmin to gather data (read: trick $users into clicking) on how many of our users are failing security tests. I inform $user of this, and verify no links were clicked and tell her she's safe to delete it and good job for passing!

Except she then reopens the ticket with the same question, but with a different email to ask about. This one says she needs to take some ***required*** security training. For reference, if you click the link and fail the test, you have to take security training that really drills home the simple mantra:

***DO NOT CLICK LINKS FROM EMAILS YOU DO NOT RECOGNIZE.***

I nicely confirm it is a legitimate email with a link to security training, (I know I know, the irony of requiring links to be clicked to be yelled at for clicking links is not lost on me but no one listened to me when I pointed it out), and kick myself for believing her that she didn't click anything. I forgot Rule 0 and for that I suffer. Which leads me to the following exchange:

**$user:**  I attempted to login and submitted a request to do so and never received an email.

(I  click the link in the email she received, click reset password, and then entered her email and confirmed with our mail filter that it accepted the reset password instructions email)  

**$me:** Did you receive one now with password reset instructions?

Weekend passes, I assume she did the thing that she was asking for when I sent it and just forgot to let me know, it happens. Monday arrives...she replies to the above email.

**$user:**  I did but after I left for the day so it has expired. Please send again and let me know when you do. Thanks.

I repeated the above steps, which are fully in her power to do, but hey it takes 2 seconds to do so I don't mind. I also confirmed for the second time that the email WAS delivered and even made a note of the time.

**$me:**  I went through your link and hit password reset again, so it should send something to you! 

**$user:**  $me, It is asking for a password.  I do not have one. I hit “reset password” but I am not receiving any emails.

**$me:**  Odd, it says it was delivered at 9:06. Can I hop in and hunt for the email? (Insert screenshot from mail filter CONFIRMING the exact moment it was delivered.)

Half an hour passes...

**$user:**  I was on the telephone. Yes, please hop in.

Like the diligent little IT slave I am I hop into her PC and pull up her inbox, and wouldn't you know it the VERY FIRST EMAIL AT THE TOP OF HER MAILBOX is an email that literally reads in all caps:

***PASSWORD RESET INSTRUCTIONS***

I open the email, click the link, which of course takes me to a screen for the password to be reset. I hop out of her computer, send:

**$me:**  Looked like the email was right there on top, you should be able to setup a new password here 

and then promptly afterwards my brain shut down. Sometimes I just need to turn off and on again. Today is not a good Monday and I hate it here.

Final Notes: this was an easy ticket overall. Not a single piece of brainpower was used to resolve this ""issue"". If all my tickets were this easy I'd have the best job in the world.

683,The wonders of wireless input devices,"*While this sub originally brought me to Reddit, I so far never considered to post any of my stories. Well, I guess it is time to change this!*

When this happened I was a student tech support in one of the university buildings, responsible for keeping everything running - may it be to ensuring updates were done or by solving issues.

One of the secretaries called in and explained that her mouse and keyboard were acting up. I promised I would be right over and, on my way there, was already less than happy. This woman was not exactly the epitome of friendly behaviour.

I got in, smiling, and asked her to show me the problem. Sure enough, her keyboard and mouse acted erratically, only accepting some of the inputs. Well, lucky for me she also kept a few spare parts to hand them out to students or workers. I picked a wired mouse from her stash and went to work on the issue. The mouse and keyboard were both *unify* technologies. Those require a special driver and the corresponding software. As this was windows and from time to time drivers got hiccups, I reinstalled those. Nope. Okay. Maybe the software had a problem? Another reinstall and... No 

As I tried these solution, the secretary stood beside me, already visibly annoyed that I dared to take a few minutes to solve her issue. Furthermore, she was complaining that it couldn't be this or that because the setup worked yesterday. My explanation that, from time to time, errors creep into a computer set-up fell on deaf ears. 

As my previous attempts had gone fruitless, I dived under her desk to see if the USB connector was either damaged or not seated properly. To my surprise, there were two of them, above each other. I turned around to inquire if she always had had the mouse and keyboard. She told me she had had a wired keyboard until recently but because the wireless mouse worked so well, she had asked for permission and then ordered a wireless keyboard for her workstation.

I got up and explained that her mouse and keyboard were from the same company which offered a special technology to reduce the number of occupied USB slots. The mouse and keyboard could and should be operated with just one connector, as the software I had just reinstalled was able to recognize both of them and their inputs. I went on to say that, most likely, her issues were created by the fact that both connectors were trying to pick up both signals, which could only result in communication chaos. I would remove one of the connectors and put it away as a backup.

Looking straight into my eye she told me:

""No that is not possible. You can't do that.""

I blinked, visibly irritated ""Excuse me?""

""It's not possible. It worked like this since I had the keyboard. If you remove a connector, it won't work anymore. It must be something else. Look for something else.""

I smiled a little, forced smile ""I'm certain this is causing the problem. It will work with just one connector, that is actually a sales argument for this technology. I'll just remove one connector, you can store it as a spare.""

""No that's not possible. Look for something else!""

I sighed and took a step back ""You called *me* as the tech support, because you did not know how to solve the problem. These systems are created so only one usb connector is needed. I'm certain this is causing the issue, thus this is my next step to try and resolve it. Either you let me try this, and if the issue persists I will look for another solution, or I'm happy to let you solve your issue, as I cannot provide you with any further assistance.""

She was not happy. But she grumbled something about letting me try, but she'd dare me to find a solution once that failed. Then she walked into the adjacent coffee kitchen.

I dove under the desk again, pulled one of the connectors, ran the connecting/calibration once more and tested the keyboard and mouse. Both worked as expected. She was still making coffee. I used the time to put the wired mouse back to where it belonged, set the wireless connector into the packaging of the keyboard and then showed her everything worked. I said my goodbyes and went back to my ""office"". 

A minute after arriving back at my desk I get a steaming, nearly screaming call from her that I couldn't just steal her wired equipment. With an annoyed, but calm tone, I informed her that I had put the mouse back to where I had taken it from. She muttered ""Oh."" And hung up. And I was, once more, happy my boss knew how complicated the employees could be, so he had told us to be stern...",24,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF92F280>
684,Let's relocate our entire IT department to a new city. Tech support will not be relocated ....,"The company in question no longer exists (and you'll understand why), but nonetheless, I will respect the rules and not name them. This isn't a single tale, but a series of small tales about how one company badly screwed up their relocation.

I had started a new job at a senior software engineer at an ISP after it had been bought by someone who liked to buy companies, kill the unprofitable parts, and immediately resell the rest at a premium since it looked profitable.

I'm sitting in the office one day when there's an emergency ""all hands"" meeting and someone stood up and gave a presentation about how they were shutting down our offices. We all had to move to a business park in a major city three hours away.

All software developers would have their relocation costs covered, but anyone else had to pay their own way. If you didn't relocate, you didn't have a job. The man asked if there were any questions. The very first question was, ""who are you?""

Seems it was our CEO. No one actually knew him and he hadn't bothered to introduce himself.

I immediately volunteered for the relocation committee and in that committee, I gave a presentation about sociologist William Whyte and a study he did: 

> Virtually all corporate relocations involve a move to a location which is closer to the CEO’s home than the old location. Whyte discovered this principle after an extensive study of Fortune 500 companies that left New York City for the suburbs in the 1950s and 1960s. They always had big, complicated Relocation Committees which carefully studied all the options and chose, coincidentally I’m sure, to move to within half a mile of the CEO’s home in Danbury, Connecticut. Whyte also showed that these companies all tanked after the relocation.

The reason are obvious: with a huge relocation, you lose a lot of staff with detailed business knowledge and the new staff repeat mistakes the old staff knew not to do.

The company relented and agreed they'd pay for relocation for the accounting team, but tech support? They're a dime a dozen. We'll replace anyone who doesn't move.

Big mistake.

We relocate and immediately it becomes clear there's a problem. The CEO stopped by and asked me what I thought about the business park and I replied ""we're well outside the city. People who want to live in X can't easily commute here. People who don't want to live in X won't want to work in a soulless business park close to a city they hate."" I realized this was a bad thing to say and apologized. The next day I came into work and there was a very nice bottle of single malt whisky sitting on my desk. It was a gift from the CEO for being honest.

That aside, we started having issues because we had very few tech support people relocate, so we temporarily retained the call center in the former city. Now we had to find tech support. Sure enough, no one wanted to work at this business park. Eventually, we found someone who ran a cable TV support center. We were an ISP. He knew _nothing_ about technology, but  otherwise, he had a solid background.

So he was hired and immediately found that he couldn't hire experienced tech support people to work in this business park. No problem! We'll hire _anyone_ who has passion for something. They'll learn on the job. How do you identify if they have passion for something?

All candidates were given colored pencils and told to draw something they were passionate about. Some candidates just walked out. Those who remained had no tech skills, but drew pretty pictures.

The inevitable support calls came in.

""Why can't I FTP anything to my server?""

""How do I set up DNS?""

""What's HTML?""

It was a disaster and things were going poorly. However, we had our accounting team. Many of them had been with the company for years and could answer those basic questions. So for a while, tech support staff were answering basic billing questions and forwarding tech support calls to accounting.

Eventually, accounting revolted and that got stopped.

But the calls didn't. The calls kept coming, and coming, and coming.

A third-level support person who stayed with us came up with an idea. Most questions were simple. So he created a FAQ as an image. He emailed it to all tech support staff and told them to set this as their desktop background and when calls came in, minimize their windows and look for a question matching what the customer was asking.

None of the tech support staff knew how to set a background image so he had to go around and do this for all of them, and show them how to minimize their windows.

So far, so bad. Things are going poorly and tech support is flooded with angry customers, call wait times were increasing, and morale was in the toilet.

And then it got better. Calls slowed down to a trickle, tech support could handle the load, and at a company party, the tech support manager got an award for his great job in reducing the number of calls to tech support. Seems he approved a software package for creating a tech support web site where customers could find their own answers.

Shortly afterwards he got fired for it.

Apparently, this web site required us to pay _for every damned click_. And the tech support manager had ordered developers to bury our tech support phone number deep within the site. Customers were clicking like mad trying to find that number, and we were getting charged for every click.

**Update**: I forgot to mention the end result. The new owner got what he wanted. He sold off various parts of the company, including the company name. It was immediately snapped up by a competitor. The company was once known as one of the top ISPs in the country. By the time the name was sold, it turned out to be so worthless that the competitor couldn't use it.

**Update 2**: Removed a link about William Whyte when I realized that violated the subreddit rules.",239,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF92F2E0>
685,Email Attachment is not there,"Have a guy call me to tell me he couldn't open a PDF attachment that my company has been sending him. We have been sending the files as PDF for as long as we've had the system which is going on 3 years now. Our emails send out a link to download Acrobat reader for those less tech savvy.

Caller: I can't open the file you sent me from my email. 

Me: What seems to be your specific issue in opening it?

Caller: It keeps telling me I have to pay for the program. (Acrobat DC).

Me: Well you can download Acrobat Reader and open the file in that, or use Microsoft Edge.

Caller: Well I've never had issues opening it on my phone before this month

Me: *suddenly confused by no context of opening it on mobile* well you're phone should have a PDF reader built in to easily see the file. Just click on the file in your email.

Caller: I clicked the link.

Me: *sighs internally* alright so you've downloaded Acrobat Reader app I'm assuming then?

Caller: Yes and it wants me to pay.

After some testing I realize that it prompts you to try and buy Acrobat DC on the Acrobat Reader app. You can just X out and use the free version easily.

Me: You do not have to pay for it. Please click the X and use the version.

Caller: When I do that it closes the app.

Me: Alright let's try to open the preview in your email. Click on the attachment. 

Caller: There's no attachment 

Me: Alright I will send again

I can see the attachments when I send from our system so I know they're there at this point. 

Caller: (Still fiddling with old email). I can see the document on my computer 

Me: So the attachment is in the email?

Caller: On the computer it is. But not on my phone.

There was a long silence before I decided it was worth the argument.

Me: It's definitely on your phone.

Caller: It's not there

Me: It really is. If it's on your computer email it's on your phone email.

Caller: I have eyes you know.

Me: I understand. So you can see the file on your phone?

Caller: No I cannot.

Me: Keep looking. What email application or provider do you have?

Caller: I dont know. My email is ... @yahoo.com


He gets frustrated and tells me after AN HOUR of back and forth he gives up and we end the call. 

I sign into my yahoo mail to locate the attachment location and get ready to email him a screenshot from my mobile.

He called back to tell me opened the new email I sent him prompted him for an application to open the attachment he finally located and he opened it in Word.

686,User wants the Logitech thing removed,"Got a ticket today to move the new guy from the training area to his desk. Got him all set up and went back to my desk.

It’s nearing the end of the day and I’m counting down the minutes until the weekend is here.

Behind me I hear a voice but can’t make out who it is because of my earbud in one ear.

It’s the new guy and he walks right up to my desk. My back faces the entry way of the office which I absolutely hate for this reason.

He stands there beside me, like a foot away, and points at the computer on my desk and says, “Can I take the Logitech thing out of the front of my computer?” His arm still is raised pointing at my computer as he stops talking.

“Uh…what Logitech thing?” I turn around and look at my computer because I have nothing Logitech and then look at his arm in front of my face just over my desk.

Then it dawns on me. He got a computer with a wireless mouse and the Logitech receiver sits in the front USB port.

“…no? That’s for your mouse. Your wireless mouse.”

You can see the blank look on his face as he stares at me. The train is arriving into the station. The light is finally on after hitting the light switch.

“Ohhhh..” he says as he finally puts down his arm.

“Yeah, cause it’s not Bluetooth.” I say as he walks back to his desk, I presume.

690,But the phone belongs to the night shift!,"We're running an extended pilot with some new cell phones & MDM software on it. The MDM solution allows the support company to do all kinds of neat stuff, including a remote control option.

But as many stories do, this one starts with a ticket. This one labeled ""phone 266 isn't working"".

The ticket has some of the nessecary info, mainly that the IQ app (the MDM one) doesn't allow them to log in stating that the pin code is incorrect.

Well I can't do anything with these phones, so I bump the ticket to the supplier and they quickly respond (I mean these guys are really quick) if we can turn the phone on so they can log in remotely and see what's what.

I inform the user, turn the phone on, then call the suppliers number, and from there on they will take over. To which I get the genius reply:

691,"I didn't think that my mom would be my next story, but sadly she is.","I am preparing to move in with my mom as her myeloma is getting worse and she shouldn't be driving nor some other tasks.

I have to install approximately 10 new network cables in my room, 3 new in the laundry room/office, and re-run the living room. I have a lot of wired network devices plus I am changing the wi-fi to a mesh wi-fi. Also we will have two different networks with one carrying all the home automation and cameras. The other will be for entertainment, internet, and printing. I've had to buy all the items needed over the last three days.

So today I went to Home depot to get everything that I needed. Keystones, punchdown blocks, A camera, smart plugs, etc.. I get everything and head back to the hospital  as today is chemo day for her. I pick her up, she is tired but OK.

Mom:  What did you do this afternoon?

Me:  Went to Home Depot and got the rest of what I needed to change the network cabling.

Mom:  I better have internet when you get done.

Me:  You'll have internet. In fact it will be much faster than what you have now.

Mom:  I don't want it any faster.

Me:  So you want to waste time waiting for internet to load the next page.

Mom:  Well no, but I also don't want to go too fast and break something.

Me:  You won't break anything.

Mom:  You are going to make this too complicated and I won't be able to use it.

Me: Don't worry it will be easier for you to use.

Mom:  That reminds me, you need to fix my tablet.

Me: What is wrong with it now?

Mom:  It won't turn on.

Me:  When was the last time you charged it?

Mom:  When you went to the hospital to have surgery. (So 3 weeks ago, mind you that she has had this tablet for SIX YEARS)

Me:  Well charge it.

Mom:  Your internet broke it.

Me:  No it didn't, I haven't done anything yet.

Mom:  Also, my phone is broken too. I can't send a text.

(Cue a 1 hour tutorial when we got home to refresh her memory about how to send a text. She just switched to iPhone from Android. She wasn't pressing the send button.)

Tablet was at 1% battery. It is 6 years old so she needs a new one soon.

&#x200B;

Mom:  You need to change the wi-fi password.

Me:  Why?

Mom:  The guy on tv said I should.

Me:  The wi-fi password is fine. Plus in 2-3 weeks, it will get changed anyways.

Mom:  I like the password now.

Me:  Then why did you just ask me to change it?

Mom:  I didn't ask you to change it.

And chemo-brain strikes again. I'm going to have fun when I do change it over.

692,"magical questions, ""Is something broken?""","While this concerns several real incidents, it really illustrated a general problem with users.   As I've noted in previous posts, one job in my career was as a sysadmin in a University computer intensive research department.  When I started we had a ticket system folks could email requests to.   We also had a separate phone line for help desk type questions (we staffed with student employees so this phone had almost full day coverage), plus our offices were physically close to our users so they could drop by.   So, all and all, a pretty user friendly support environment.  

I hadn't been on board very long before I had the first of what turned out to a regular experience.   I was walking down the hallway near my office when a professor happened by.  

""Is something broken?"" he asked.  

I stopped and thought about it for a second and then realized this wasn't a rhetorical question, but actually something that probably should general a trouble ticket.    After some discussion I got the gist of the problem, I don't remember what it actually was, but I either opened a ticket for him, or asked him to open one.

Similar encounters happened regularly, almost always with the same ""Is something broken?"" question.   After I had been there a while I developed my own canned response to these rather vague questions, to whit:

$Professor:  ""Is something broken?""

$Me: ""Almost certainly.   But why you don't you tell what problem you're having?""

With some of the faculty that had better senses of humor, I tried  some more fun answers:

$Professor:  ""Is something broken?""

$Me:  ""Well, my car has been acting up a bit lately""

or

$Me:  ""I think I'm going to need a new roof on my house soon""

or

$Me: ""The second urinal from the right in the men's room isn't flushing normally""

We ran a full set of services:  DNS, LDAP, DHCP, email, web, file sharing, account maintenance, and supported several hundred desktop systems with mix of Linux, Windows, and OSX, along with a full network infrastructure, firewall, switches, VLANs, and ACLs.   

So, a reasonably complex environment, so, yeah, at any one time, something was sure to be broken.

693,Rush support request but no details,"This particular incident happened a few years ago, but I still get similar requests a few times a year. Sales teams need to submit a ticket for sales support, there is even a default template:

*Client Name/Client number:*

*Account number:*

*Issue:*

*Steps to replicate:*

Last point usually isn't included, but the first three are crucial to discerning and addressing issues in a timely fashion.

Sales person couldn't be troubled by any of this, ticket comes in with ""We have a problem with <holding company>, fix it."" 

I looked up the holding company, they have 4 companies under them, each servicing 2-\~50 clients.

I add this to the ticket, and we'll need more information (""who exactly is having what problem?"").

Sales person says, ""Just fix the damn problem, they are an important client. Do it now."" (they literally put this in the ticket)

""Ok, I see this is very high priority for you, we'll start reviewing every account for this holding company, it should take about 1-3 hours  to review each account, and given they have over 150 active accounts, we should have this review complete in \~4 weeks, once your Sales VP authorizes my Support VP to ONLY work on this for the next 4 weeks. Even then, without additional information, we may miss the exact issue that spurred this request. If you provide the account number and the issue, we can probably resolve it the same day.""

Sales person doesn't respond for two weeks, then follows up with ""What's the status?""

""You didn't include authorization, or more information. The account reviews have not started.""

""It's been two weeks, < multiple expletives> how could you have done nothing for two weeks?!"" he adds his manager and the Sales VP to the ticket.

 I copy & paste my ""Ok, I see this..."" response to the top of the ticket, bold the ""Sales VP authorizes"" and ""same day"" parts, and ask, ""If it was an actual priority, how could you do nothing when we're waiting on you?""

My desk was about 50ft from the sales VP's office. The whole floor clearly heard him chew out the sales person, ""...BLAMING SUPPORT FOR YOUR OWN FUCK UP..."" was what I remember most clearly... Formal reprimand was entered into the sales person's employee file. 

My VP was in that meeting, she stopped by afterwards, ""One minor thing. Please put the ""ask/next step"" at the TOP going forward.

$gem = This User

$me = Me

**EDIT:** I feel I should note, this user is in the 20-30 age range. This is not an elderly user who is just becoming a bit senile.

# In which he needs to press a button

One fine afternoon I was finishing up work and preparing to leave, when this user called me with an issue. I don't recall the specifics of the issue, but it was something on his cellphone. During the course of troubleshooting, I told him to go to the home screen of his phone...

$gem: ""How do I do that?""  
$me: *sighs*. ""At the bottom of your phone there are three buttons. Press the middle one.""  
*long pause*  
$gem: ""There aren't any buttons at the bottom of my phone.""  
$me: ""On the phone itself. Not on-screen. There are three physical buttons.""  
$gem: ""No... There are no buttons.""

Now, we deploy the same phones to all of our users. I know what phone he has, and I know for a fact that there is a back button, home button, and menu button. I insist that yes, there are three buttons at the bottom of his phone. He insists that there are not. Finally, frustrated, I tell him to describe to me what he sees.

$gem: ""Umm I see a charging port... Speakers...""

# In which I need to work on his phone

More recently, $gem contacted me saying that he was unable to open an Excel spreadsheet on his phone. I stepped him through several troubleshooting steps, and got it fixed. The next day, I receive a text from him. ""For some reason it's doing the same thing again?"" Via text, I walk him through trying the same troubleshooting steps. This time it does not fix it. After a full reinstall of Excel still fails to fix it, I tell him that I will need to see it in person.

$me: ""OK, I will have to see it then to figure out what is going on.""  
$gem: ""OK.""

*A day passes.*

$gem: ""IT'S STILL NOT WORKING!!!!!! Did you figure anything out????""  
$me: ""As I said, I will need to see it in person so I can dig into it and figure out what is going on.""

696,Escalation: The folder name is too long!!,"For context and to understand what this is about, you have to understand the limitations of NTFS and Windows folder-sharing:

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTFS)

=> the maximum allowable filename length on NTFS is 255 characters! (this limitation was only recently removed with Windows 10, but chances are that older Windows server OS releases still have it ...)

That includes folder names and network share names. So if you had a file like e.g. `C:\Folder\Filename.Ext`  ... that's fine.

If you construct something like: `S:\MyShare\<... some super long complex path here ...>\<... more complex folder structure here ...>\Totally_very_long_unnecessary_long_super-duper_filename_here.ext` ... then you will run into the *""File name too long!""* error.

So there I was keeping an eye on the support ticket pool when this ticket comes in:

***Title: ""Folder name is too long !""***

Other information in the ticket:

***Priority: Urgent***

***Multiple users affected: Yes***

&#x200B;

**But:** it neither tells me **WHICH FOLDER** or **WHO** the users are that are affected (e.g. so I could maybe call them and ask them which folder was giving them troubles? Nope ...)

Ugh. Facedesk.

**How in the world can you forget to add this super crucial piece of information??**

And the person who forwarded the ticket into my pool (... and thus might maybe know more? ...) already went home and isn't reachable anymore. Just great. Fantastic timing...  sigh.

So I take the ticket, no matter what. I figure sooner or later the ticket will run into a timeout (since it was marked as *""Urgent""* ...) and someone who had anything to do with the creation of this ticket might call me then?

Yes, good plan. Apart from trying my luck with Crystall Balls and Tarot cards this is about the only thing I can do at this point.

I have like a few 10'000 users and probably several 100'000 folders and millions of files on our storage systems. There's no way I can ever find out which users and which folder the ticket is talking about if they don't tell me ...  Even if I created a script that scanned all the storage systems for files with long names it would probably take ages to hit the right files in the right folder. It would be SO SO MUCH faster if they simply told me ...  sigh.

**But nope. Let's just create a ticket that will auto-escalate and let's not tell the support guy which folder or which user is affected. Forcing support people to search for needles in haystacks is so much fun... (pro tip:  NO IT'S NOT)**

And indeed, various timeouts start going off. About 15 minutes after I took the ticket, the ticketing system sends me messages like:

***Your action is required. If you do not act upon Support Request <Ticket number> this ticket may be escalated.***

Fantastic!  This is exactly what I want. Hopefully then someone will give me the stupid information I need.

So the warnings repeat a few times when after about 1 hour I see the ticket has indeed escalated and now it is assigned to one of the escalation managers on the customer side ...

My hope was since this escalation manager person is from the same customer he might know which folder and which users are affected? Or at least it might be a lot easier for them to find out ...?

Yes, I am naive, LOL :)

This was the moment when I notice that my new best friend Mr. Escalation Manager has changed the title of the ticket.

***New title:***  ***""THE FOLDER NAME IS TOO LONG !!!!!!!!!""***

***Priority: Escalation***

***Multiple users affected: Yes***

&#x200B;

Cool. All these big capital letters and all those exclamation marks will totally help me resolve the issue (pro tip: NO THEY WILL NOT ...).  Facepalm.

And then my phone rings. I can see on the display that Mr. Escalation Manager is calling me ...

*""Hello! Mr. Poor Support Guy speaking, how may I help you ... ""*

*""Duuuude, what's going on over there?  I know you did see the support ticket, so why the hell is it taking so long ...?""*

*""Well... the ticket is missing all relevant information, there is nothing I can do ... ""*

Mr. Escalation Manager screams into the phone: *""WHAAAAT!?? The error message is right there!! Let me read it for you: The folder name is too long!!  You can read, right? ...""*

*""Yes ...""*

Mr. Escalation Manager screams even louder:  ***""THE F\*KN FOLDER NAME IS TOO LONG!!!!!!!""***

*""Yes...  And now if you could use your energy and tell me* ***WHICH*** *folder exactly, that'd be great ....""*

*""Ugh ....""*   **\*crickets\***

*""Ahem ... It doesn't say which folder ...?""*

*""Nope""*

Mr. Escalation Manager is very very silent all of a sudden.

*""Can you at least tell me which of your users are affected? So I could maybe ask them which folder is giving them trouble ...?""*

*""Ugh.  It doesn't say which users are affected? ...""*

*""Nope""*

*""Ahemmm.... well ... ugh. I will try and find out and call you back.* ***Tomorrow.****""*

Oh I see.  *""Priority: Urgent""* indeed, huh?

The next morning I can see that the title of the ticket was edited again:

697,Let me just check the flux capacitor," I'm a full stack web dev, mostly working on developing and maintaining eCommerce sites using my company's in-house platform. We do support and maintenance as well as new sites and features, but aren't expected to support end users directly. However we occasionally (or in the case of the site that features in this story, not so rarely) get end user issues forwarded to us if the client's helpdesk can't fix it or just don't feel like doing their jobs today.

This story features the same healthcare-adjacent eCommerce site as [my previous tale](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/pepaox/a_case_of_impeccable_timing/). Our client contact got in touch in a panic:

>$client: URGENT account help please look at this urgently!!  
>  
>$manager: Hey $me, can you look into this?  
>  
>$client: I have no idea what's happened, $customer only signed up on Monday but has been getting text notifications about an order he didn't place since Saturday!

Yes, our site is malfunctioning and sending spurious notifications *back in time* to *before we had this customer's contact details*.

Or maybe, it's not anything to do with *his* account at all? I knew what had happened as soon as I read the email - it's the same reason I semi-regularly get texts for a Ms James about her supermarket order...

Seems like a bit of a coincidence that some other customer would make a typo in their mobile number that was not only another valid mobile number, but another customer of this site - but of course, it wasn't another customer's mobile at the time, and probably the recipient of the texts signed up in an attempt to get them to stop.

To be fair to the client contact, they could reasonably have wanted help identifying the account that mistakenly had $customer's mobile number, since our CMS doesn't have a function to search by phone number. Instead, I fired up my database client and confirmed that this was the case, pulled out the ID of the offender, and provided idiot-resistant instructions to resolve the issue.

We also recommended to $client that they have us update the text message templates to greet the customer by first name, to make any such issues in the future more apparent. So it was far from a useless request.

But I can't help but laugh at the panicked report that $customer's account was malfunctioning *since before it existed*.",16,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF92F7C0>
698,Why is your non-existent firewall blocking our custom FTP port?,"A tale from Whirlwind Computing^(TM) where we service your request so fast that it will blow you and the competition away!

Cast:  
$Me - The hero without a cape \[Edna forbids such\]    
$Lady - Client that eventually ignores me  

Anyways,   

I get an after-hours call & ticket from $Lady about a firewall blocking some ports on an internet connection....

Really?  

Aye aye captainette!  

We'll give this a jolly good look in the morning as the watchdogs ~~are sleeping~~ see no issues from the CPE and distribution ~~pints~~ points , your connection is good and ping times are excellent!  

$Lady - \*exasperated\* Can you check your firewall puhlease???  

Note that this kind of request is not unheard of, but she had a raw unfiltered connection, so she is responsible for blocking & stopping those cheeky little buggers being a downright nuisance on the internet.  

\*The next morning\*  

$Me - I don't know, there's no firewall between you and the great beyond, can you tell me how it's all set up?  

Can you share some insight into the network layout and the path the servers are supposed to take to communicate?    

$Lady - Yes, we're using port 67,000 for FTP to upload the documents and it fails after the hop past our firewall, therefore your firewall is blocking us.

$Me - \*record scratch\*    
Wait... what?  

There's your problem, any firewall is going to drop a connection outside of the RFC and port scope for TCP/IP  

$Lady - Actually, it's port 62,000  

Me \*internally\* dang it!  

Me \*externally\* Can you check and verify the path between the servers and show some traceroutes so that we can verify the path to/from the webservice?

>Wife: I am having the WORST DAY right now!! I need your help... first of all, the text started coming out of my cursor the wrong way after I hit some mysterious keyboard shortcut...

>Me: Huh? What do you mean the text came out of it the wrong way? Like the text direction was reversed?

>Wife: Yes!! I don't know what I hit, but somehow I would type ""Let's talk soon"" and it would show up as ""noos klat s'teL""! And the blinking cursor was on the right of my text box in Teams!!

>Me: Uh...? Was your text direction reversed, like somehow your system language was changed to Hebrew or someth -

701,The time I was called in to stop an 11 year old genius.,"This one is going to be a little different from most of what I have seen on this sub. Whereas most posts here involve rampant stupidity, this one involves genius. A couple had seen my flyers I had posted, still in 2007 working for myself, as a pc technician. They called me and told me their daughter (11) kept bypassing their parental software and going online. They asked me to take a look and see what I could do.

So I go in, look at their xp setup, and of course, the software is garbage. I test it out, and am able to kill it via the device manager. So I go online, look for a better one and install it. I see the kid peeking from around a corner just... smirking. I know she's done something. I open the new software, everything seems fine. It was something like netware nanny or something, I can't remember the name. Basically, it blocked any attempt to open non-whitelisted websites.

Still, that smug look made me more curious. I looked around the programs folder, nothing stood out. Checked running processes, everything ok. Looked in the service list, fine. Ok, time for a reboot.

As the computer reboots, I notice something. For a brief second it said that the first boot device was disabled and loaded the secondary. Since I had been hired to investigate, I did so. I rebooted again and loaded the bios menu. There was a second hard drive listed in the bios as primary. I booted it up and it brought me to a very familiar linux screen I had been using at the time at home.

She had somehow managed to install a second hard drive, hide it in windows, load it with linux and hide all of this from her parents. I was incredibly impressed. I wrote a short note to her, because I knew she would figure out a way past what I was about to do eventually. I then went into the bios and locked it with the linux boot device disabled. I thought about giving her up and handing her parents the hard drive. But I just couldn't.

I wrote down the password to the bios, handed it to them and told them I had locked the bios so it couldn't be changed without the password. I still wonder how long it took her to find that slip of paper and get back online.

Edit: This blew up a lot more than I expected. Yes, I am aware that pulling the bios battery resets the password and was another avenue she could take. I am not 100% sure what happened as I was not called back. I'm curious, but not curious enough to go trying to track her down. Creepiness factor would be pretty high. But I am loving the relatable stories. It's impressive how many of you had similar problems to her and had so many creative solutions.

702,"The tale of when things go from simple emergency to ""Oh My God! Get someone on this thing now! The CEO is standing there in the store with the CIO and CFO and nothing's working!""","So context. I work on a contract for a Tech Support in...well, car store name here. Mostly store and employees, not customers. So I mostly handle making the tickets and sending them to someone who can do the job. Or, if possible, doing it myself like replacement orders or data file work with the supervisor. That's mostly what I do.

However, this one call I get, I say the lines the company wants me to say, fill out the info, and hear this:

CA = Caller

Primus = Me

CA: Yeah, so the entire line of registers can't open their cash drawers so can't make much in sales.

Primus: Okay, give me a second - *Me filling out ticket information in a bored fashion*

CA: And I got the CEO standing here along with the rest.

Primus: *Thinking ""What did she say?""* I'm sorry. Did you say CEO?

CA: (laughing to hide anxiety from her most powerful boss right in front of her with 11 other high-ranking people) Yes. So you can imagine this is a bigger problem than you think it is.

Thank god for the lady being nice and trying to joke about it. I mean, I wouldn't curse out tech support if the big boss was standing right there, possibly checking out the place and seeing how it's going. So...there I go informing the tech group in Teams about this. My supervisor, thinking it's just a normal cash drawer not opening on all drawers, told me to send it to the emergency line. Yeah, you can guess what I told him next.

Needless to say, he dropped everything he was doing and went about getting someone very good at their job to do this ticket. Obviously, no chances are being taken. I mean, the moment I mentioned the CEO, CIO, and CFO was in the house, I imagine the tech group team that handles high-ranking problems went into overdrive to quickly fix this. It was all allocated within one minute in fact.

The problem...the switching hub where everything connects to was disconnected. So yeah. That sent everyone into a panic and numerous times told where I got constant updates until it was handed off. The thing that was most crazy, my name was taken off as the maker of the ticket, and the person who took over placed theirs. Even though the system always places the initial person who made the ticket onto the entry as like first and chosen choice. Guess they didn't want like no low-ranking person to have their name attached to this.",33,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF92FAF0>
703,Working with a tech who swears in his native Finnish is hilarious but also wholesome,"So I stated in another post on this sub that I work for an international robotics company, specifically in our Service department. We are responsible for any hardware issues that arise and go to local sites to fix stuff or source techs to go to sites out of state. I myself am the senior-most person in our department and will soon be replacing my boss since he is retiring this week. 

For the past two months, I've been working the overnight shift all by myself. Help desk is there too of course, but I mainly do everything on my own from getting stuff ready for shipping to working with techs over the phone. Nothing too difficult. Well last night I was on the phone with a tech from a site in Finland. 

Let's call the guy Lars (his middle name actually, we have his full name in our records). He is absolutely the biggest sweetheart you can imagine. Always kind, gentle, upbeat, respectful, etc. Not a bad word you can say about him. So I was on the phone with him for about a half hour and he was doing a relatively easy fix: replacing a front panel/cover on the robot as the original had been cracked after someone hit it with a hospital bed. I say ""relatively easy"" because there are a lot of screws that have to be threaded very carefully and can be tricky to get them to catch and tighten. 

It was just funny hearing him, anytime he strained, swear loudly even when he set the phone down. I tried using translate on my phone and got words like *Vittu*, *Huora* and *Kyrpä*. I'll let y'all look those up lol. I myself had my phone on mute and was laughing up a storm. I especially laughed when he would walk away for a second or two and I'd hear him swearing in the distance. But again, this guy is such a sweetheart and did everything right with regards to fixing it. 

I love just talking to him about his personal life also like his kids that are in college, where he and his wife are going on holiday, etc. Great guy I wish I could meet in person.",45,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF92FD00>

- - - - -

_A quick refresher: Texas is a one-party state for audio recording._

----- 

_Well,_ I thought as I went over the transcript provided by the recording software. _That's for that, then._

I leaned forward in my chair in my home office, pouring a generous two fingers of some rather nice Christmas whisky that the wife had purchased for me, and then leaned back, sipping at it as I pondered. I knew at this point, there was no way in hell that they were going to give me anything I was asking for, despite having (verifiably) saved them at least three times my annual salary in under a year (with the potential to quintuple that if it got rolled out to the other 5 branch offices, especially Atlanta and Denver). 

This, of course, wouldn't have stood under previous management - the original owner would have said ""holy shit, Jack, that's pretty damn good, here's a nice chunk of change,"" especially since the [original incarnation of the imaging system I rolled out back in 2014](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/1oaudk/my_little_gpo_schadenfreude_is_magic_high_school/) was the biggest reason they still had a contract with one of the biggest, most recognizable religious educational institutions in the Austin area. Meanwhile, on average, the tier 1s / hardware techs in Austin and Dallas were reimaging about 10 boxes on a daily basis, each of which had enough automation to save about 2 or 3 hours of touch-time per tech (and reduced procedural errors by a ridiculous amount, making even the most user-brained tier 1 look competent).

But the original owner had ascended to the parent company with a seat on its board, and the hedge fund that owned that company was, well, a bog-standard hedge fund - they valued profits more than anything else, and they didn't give a damn about rewarding employees who actually did the work. The parent company cared that the companies it owned under the brand's umbrella were profitable, and as long as management showed that, they gave them free reign.

_My options are pretty limited,_ I ruminated, swirling my whisky in the glass. _I haven't got three months of cushioning available, and the wife is finishing up her certification program and internship, so flipping them the bird is right out for now. The current management would definitely try to enforce my noncompete, but it's been laughed out of court before for other employees - and fifty miles would mean I'd have to move, which is also right out. Hmm._

I took a healthy swig, then continued, but out loud.

""I don't intend to poach any clients, and I'm not going to break any nondisclosure agreements or be a complete dickbag... screw it, I'm going to talk to $COCKWOMBLE one more time when I'm in the office next.""

I was pretty pissed at him at this point, but for another reason.

The last of the coworkers whom I'd formed the elite team with had quit, and $COCKWOMBLE decided to move the tier III techs / sysadmins (of which there were four - this will be important later, so remember that) to my old team's area.

""But wait, Jack, didn't he take away that nice room with doors that you all could close so you could concentrate on your work?""

WHY YES, HE DID!

He had moved us out directly across from the kitchen, so not only did we hear everyone talking and jawing it up in the kitchen - along with all the smells associated with it - but he put us in the same area that the purchasing team and cabling crews used, so we had absolutely insane foot traffic passing us regularly, as well as shoulder surfers and tier 1 / 2s who would come over to us for help with their tickets _instead of asking over Teams for assistance_. Of course, he demanded that we all start using headsets for everything, which had the side problem of blocking out us hearing when people walked up behind us.

Now, I'm a survivor of some pretty horrific stuff (it's most definitely NSFW, so I'll leave it to your horrified - and possibly surprised - imagination as to just _what_ I went through), and as a result, I have some _very_ well-developed self-defense instincts.

Protip: don't sneak up on someone like me when I'm zoned in and working and _not_ expect me to do my best [Helga Pataki impression](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOIbb3Jpqf8) out of surprise and fear.

It was very quickly changed so that I didn't have to worry about having someone sneak up on me, since my back was to a wall after that, and in a corner seat.

However, the rest of the changes... well, they were troubling, to say the least.

THE NEXT DAY...

-----

I finished up everything I'd been working on, then packed up my laptop case and grabbed my to-go mug (Texas in spring was just cool enough that I could drive the whole way home with the windows down, listening to All Things Considered, and finish a 32-ounce black coffee just as I got to the driveway - unless someone wrecked on Pennybacker Bridge, or traffic was well and truly screwed), then locked my machine and got up, shutting off the lamp next to me on the minifridge as I did so.

Walking over towards $COCKWOMBLE's office, I flipped on the recorder app again, then paused by the door for a second. 

""Like, if somebody walked in my office right now, and he was saying that he wants to leave since he's underpaid, but wanted to give us the chance to make it up - well, we're working on getting temp services through $STAFFING_FIRM. I'd just tell $HR_DALEK to add another one to the list, and instead of instead of hiring three temps, we'd get a fourth too. You know what I mean?""

At that point, the hope that I had that he would negotiate with me faded to almost nothing, and all I could see was a cold, clear rage. I resolved that when I got home, I was going to talk with some coworkers and see what they thought.

I waited about thirty seconds, grateful the lights were off and the walls next to me were nonreflective, then knocked on the wall next to his office door.

""Got a minute, $COCKWOMBLE? I wanted to see if you all would consider nonmonetary compensation, or quality of life improvements, in lieu of a raise.""

""What did you have in mind, Jack?"" he said, not knowing that I'd heard the tail end of his conversation. 

""More PTO - ""

""Jack, you've been here almost seven years. You get six weeks of PTO a year - ""

""And it only matters if you either let me take it - and because I know our client base across all regions inside and out, I very often do _not_ get my requests approved - or if you pay it out. I'll continue."" He shut up, and I kept going. ""Telecommuting, reduced work hours, exemption from the on-call rotation - and on that one, by the way, that's almost criminal. A total of $100 for 48 hours of waiting-to-engage with a 15-minute response to any ticket or call that comes in, no exceptions for time or severity? Yeah, no.""

His face went dark. ""No one is going to get telecommuting back. Joe hates it and wants everyone in for face-time. I don't really like it either - I want to know everyone's working at all times. You may have been effective, but we had others who weren't, so we have to have a blanket policy for it.""

""That's ridiculous. I did it just fine for a year and a half, and it's only under the current regime that it's become verboten.""

""It's policy. Oh, and no one is getting exempted from on-call, period. We can't afford to increase the on-call pay right now, and it's going to be treated as a bonus  - ""

_Which means it's going to keep being taxed at 33%,_ I cynically thought.

""And we need every senior tech in the rotation too, so you can't get out of it.""

""And, of course, new hires are going to be hired on at what I'm currently making.""

""Wait, what? What are you talking about?""

""Oh, don't feed me that. You know that Andy, Will, and Chris were hired on at what I make or more. If you're going to pay me less than new hires, I would expect that you make up for it in perks.""

He shrugged. ""We can't do nonmonetary perks, and we hire people at rates commensurate with their professional experience and skillset.""

I snorted. ""Clearly, the posts on Glassdoor and Indeed stating that the tier 3 salary range _starts_ at what I earn without the overtime and on-call back that up.""

$COCKWOMBLE plowed on, oblivious. ""$HR_JUNIOR_DALEK took that ad down. I'm surprised anyone saw it. About your other item, well, we probably won't make up for the lack of raises with things that don't cost money - that's not a traditional practice.""

""It is, however, definitely a viable cost-feasible means to get around budgetary restrictions.""

""I don't think so. It if I was to tell someone, 'hey, I'm not gonna get anyone an annual raise this year, but you can all work, but you need the cost of living raise - '""

""Right, because let's face it, in this city, the cost of living is insane - ""

""But,"" he cut back in, ""you can't have the best of both worlds. You can't be, like, okay, you need to get a salary increase _and_ perks or benefits that are not at the company now. You see? I'm saying, so, as an award we've chosen to give a compensation increase versus perk increases.""

""You're not giving us either of them, so that's irrelevant, and you only pay out 40 hours of PTO on exit.""

""It's company policy. We had some employees, like $TIER_2, who left, then called in sick his last week, and we just marked him unrehireable.""

I shrugged. ""It's a dick move. If you're going to quit, do it ethically and properly, and wind up or pass off all your projects. Anything else is... unprofessional.""

$COCKWOMBLE missed the very clear shot. ""I think it would be more like..  so, like, I'll give you a good example. If I had a hiring agent call me and be, like, 'what's going on,' I'm probably not going to tell him anything, because I can't - because of liability. Me, personally? That's a whole 'nother story. To an extent, just interference is a thing. If, like... I'll give you the example. I can just be, like...""

He sat for a second and pondered before continuing.

""So I can tell you this.  I could be like, 'I wouldn't hire them again.' I can say that. It's no violation, as long as you don't go into specifics.""

A smarmy smirk wormed its way across his face. ""And, technically, if they're a back channel, if it's not formal, if I know the person... oh, yeah. If it's a back channel anything goes.""

Twisted Nerve was playing on loop in the mental instance of Winamp I had running.

""We were talking about adjusting your compensation to bring you in line with the new hires, but I can't tell you anything else about that, since every time I do it comes back to bite me in the ass when the directors find out. We were considering moving you to onboarding, since you're so detail-oriented - ""

""I would rather stick sporks under my eyeballs and apply 12 pounds of pressure.""

""But I figured that wasn't your thing, and I'm not going to talk about anything else, since every time I tell you something it bites me in the ass later.""

_You have no clue how true that's going to be,_ I thought as I nodded ""good night"" and walked out to my car for the hour-long drive home, not tapping the stop button on the recording until I was out of the parking lot so as to remain undetected.

705,My experience with the cupholder call.,"Back when I was fresh out of college, I worked for myself for a while doing tech support, website building and whatever else I could get. I wasn't strong with networking, but could manage minor installs, run cable etc. So I did pretty ok for myself for a while as a general all around IT guy.

A woman, in her mid 60s, who lived a couple blocks away from me had had me install and build a computer from parts she had bought online at my recommendation. She saved about $150 buying it piecemeal and hiring me to put it together and got a better machine to boot. This was back when purchasing parts online cost 1/2 what a full machine cost.

A few weeks later, she calls me up saying her cup holder had broken. I respond with a confused ""ok?""

She told me I need to fix it because the cup holder was too flimsy and couldn't handle a heavy drink. The drink spilled all over her tower and it was a huge mess. I walk over because it wasn't too far and was a nice day. And I come in to a mess. The rug underneath the tower was soaked. I unplugged the machine and lifted it up and I immediately see the problem. This was 2007 and people still had CD and DVD drives. She had used the CD drive as a cup holder and it had promptly snapped in half. 

It took me a few minutes to explain to her what the cd drive was and that using it as a cupholder was NOT its intended use. Fortunately, she wasn't stupid and was able to accept her mistake.

706,Maybe do send a network engineer to do a server admin's job?,"I don't know if it's a rule that you have to say this, but ... LTL FTP.

Characters in this story include:

Me - me, Network Engineer at $MSP

$ServerMSP – Server Admin at $MSP

$ServerClient – Server Admin at $Client

&#x200B;

I work for an MSP. One of our clients has a firewall that also acts as an SSL VPN terminator. My team (networking) manages this firewall.

My team received a request to add some new VPN groups to the firewall to allow users to access specific servers on specific protocols. The firewall queries AD to get user group memberships.

We set this up and then moved to testing. $ServerClient moved his account out of the IT Staff VPN group, and put it into the newly created group, then logged into the VPN. However, he had more access than the new user group was supposed to get.

When I was told about this, I double checked my firewall & VPN config (all correct) and logs. Sure enough, his VPN session was matching the IT Staff user group, even though he had removed his AD account from that group.

My next thought – ‘Probably nested AD groups.’ I message $ServerMSP and ask him to check if the IT Staff VPN group is nested inside any other groups that $ServerClient is a member of. $ServerMSP checks AD and says no, no nested groups there so that’s not the issue.

I set up a troubleshooting session with $ServerClient and run debugs on the firewall. I can clearly see that when the firewall is querying the AD server for $ServerClient’s AD group memberships, it is reporting that he is a member of both groups (IT Staff and new VPN group). I bring up my same suggestion: ‘probably nested AD groups.’ $ServerClient checks the group in AD and says no, that’s not the issue.

At this point I pass the work on to $ServerMSP and his team. The firewall only does what it’s told, and I can see that it’s being given incorrect information.

A few days later, I receive an email from $ServerClient: “We found the issue! The IT Staff VPN group is nested inside another group that my account is a member of!”",22,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF698A00>
707,Rooftop remote dish connection problem,"Disclaimer: Not my story but from someone I worked with over a decade ago I was reminded of by some other story.  

In the northern part of the Netherlands there were two offices connected to each other via a pair of rooftop dishes. The simple kind of connection, less than 1 km apart.  

The client complained frequently that the remote office would be unable for several minutes at various times throughout the week. Each time a technician had a look the problem would have disappeared and could not be replicated.  

After a few months of trying different things all hardware bits had been replaced one technician came up with a diagnostic plan. The plan in question? Take a lawnchair to the roof and sit next to the dish on one of the roofs and look at the other dish.  

It took several hours but then it happened: about halfway a bridge in one of the canals opened to let a boat pass.  

The fix was easy: move both dishes to the side a bit so the bridge was no longer in line of sight.",74,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF698A60>
708,Salty PC,"During the move of our departments, one of our sheriff's phoned my direct extension. This is how the conversation went down:

Me: IT, this is LcRohze, how can I help you?

James(not real name ofc): Hey so I have an issue with my computer not turning on.

Me: Alright, when did this start happening and did you notice anything like a powersurge recently?

James: Happened today and I believe the cause is that I spilled salt water on it?

Me: ...Excuse me, did you say salt water?

James: Yeah so I was in our evidence room and I was moving my desktop when I accidentally bumped into this salt water aquarium and ended up spilling some of the water into my machine. 

Me: Okay wha-

James: So I did the thing on youtube where you put the machine into rice and let it sit for a while but its still not turning on? I know we're supposed to save any documents we're working onto the network folders but I was in the middle of writing an FBI report and I really need that.

Me: *internally screaming - How the fuck? Why the fuck rice? How do you get a desktop in a container with rice???? What the heck is going on???* 

At this point I am physically straining myself to NOT laugh in their face. Fucking HOW. So I tell him I'll be on my way to check it out. Granted I knew this sheriff was a bit special with tech but this took the cake. I get over to the sheriff's department, front desk lady buzzes me through and I get escorted back to the evidence room to see the damage.

He managed to spill a whole lot more than some saltwater. The desktop was still basically soaked when I got there and sure as shit he had it in a plastic bin filled with multiple bags worth of rice. The desktops we deploy are those Big Name Brand machines with the easy hinge doors for quick access to the innards. I pull the SSD that was installed and visibly there's no damage to drive. I told the deputy to be more careful, a bit more sternly, and reminded him how expensive the machines are for the county. He apologizes some more and I tell him I will try my best to pull data off the drive. Luckily the drive was fine and has a new home. I pulled the report he needed off the drive onto a thumb drive and gave it back to him.

Please don't spill saltwater on your computers.",109,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF698AC0>

Client: Right next to the router. Me: (Face palm) Move the repeater to an area about halfway or so from the other room you are working in. It can't extend the range of the‍ signal if it's in the same room at the router. Client moves repeater and viola....weak WiFi issues go away.

711,A little old school knowledge helps solve a months old issue,"TL;DR Special characters in filename wasn't caught for months.

Started working for an MSP a few years ago and early on during a shadow session, the primary tech for the client ask me to look into an issue that had baffled them for months. We are onsite and addressing some issues, and found some idle time. While he was working on a system reimage, I looked into why schedule reports in a software package was not creating reports.

I got to work familiarizing myself with the software, and what it did. Then look into the reporting problem. All settings looked normal, nothing stood out. Try to run the schedule report now, and it would stop with a vague error message. I'm thinking, well I have  an error message so time to call the vendor and get the meaning behind it. I got connected to a very pleasant tech who went through the usual steps to check the basics, etc. Then moved on to more advance troubleshooting. The vendor tech start running logs and we checked for messages. The error came up after the logs show unable to create the file for the report. Great still more vague info, but at least its a step in the right direction.

I was thinking it could be a storage issue, but this was on a server used by multiple people and I decided to dismiss it since nobody else had issues creating files. I was staring at the filename used to create the report, when I realized the root cause was staring me back in the face. The filename used a $ in it and I remembered there are limitation on file naming under NTFS and older storage formats.  I simplified the filename removing any special characters and the report ran successfully. 

The vendor tech was on a remote session and was watching me and was also surprised. I asked them to send an enhancement request to add checking to the report section to disallow special characters, to avoid this for their other customers as well.",78,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF698BE0>
712,We don't swim in your toilet...,"Came back from lunch to find a pile of wet towels on my chair with the distinct smell of undermaintained pool.

""Uh, $Minion, what... ? ""

He tells me a $Director came in, asked for me by name, dropped the towels, and left. 

""And you didn't move them whynot?"" 

""A) Eww. B) I figured the damage was done. C) See A."" 

I fetched a new chair and a yardstick and poked at the towels, which held an HP laptop, the best we deploy, shiny, bright, and brand new. And waterlogged. 

About this time, $SeniorDirector appears and beams at me. He knows I can save the day. It seems that the owner/operator of this laptop, the previously aforementioned $Director from before, decided to take a video call from the balcony overlooking his pool so he could keep an eye on his kids' friends who had come over to swim. Picture the scene, he says, the sun is shining, the breeze is cool, and right next to the laptop on the little glass table there's a fancy drink with an umbrella and a lemon slice in it. 


And then he knocks over the drink towards the laptop. 


With lightning reflex, he grabs the laptop and pulls it away from lemony doom. 


It slips from his fingers. 


It impacts - screen and keyboard first - on the concrete edge of the pool before sinking into the deep end. 


He has to send his daughter down there to get it. 


And here it is. For me to save. 


(The best part of the story? The video call was being recorded. It actually survived a couple seconds underwater before the signal cuts out.)


As I'm standing there staring at it, $Director reappears with - I am not making this up - a 20 lb bag of rice slung over his shoulder. He drops it in the corner (my corner!), cuts it open (with my scissors!), and ever-so-proudly drops the laptop in (leaving the towels on my former chair). 


At the moment, I have the SSD out to dry overnight before we try to read it in the morning.

713,The Infamous Text Field Rabbit Hole,"This is the tale of technical simplicity and corporate politics.

Part 1: intro

So it was my first week on the job. Nobody had any clue what I was supposed to do, neither did I. You see, there wasn't a support department before me, so I was alone in a dangerous world.

Anyway I get myself into the Ops department, introduce myself to the manager and ask her to show me around.
She introduces me to a long time ops employee that worked pretty much on all projects (around 150 of them).
 
""Hi, how are you?"" - I say colloquially.

*He understands ""Hi, what are you doing"" and replies ""well, I'll be happy to show you""

I instantly sit down and get bombarded with the horrible UI and text fields of the operations interface.

""This field is already filled, we don't change that, the other field needs to be filled with a date [...]"" - you get the point.

After one hour he says ""done"" and opens a large notebook on his desk, and starts writing down the project name, fields, forms, starting codes, end hour.

""Do you mind if I ask what are you writing down""

""Oh, no problem, it's all work related, I write down everything I do in a workday, all projects, all issues, any relevant information. I have 5 notebooks full from this month alone""
(Operators had no personal account or computer, they were using virtual boxes with the interface only)

""Oh, okay ... Will you be willing to show me an issue that you encounter frequently?""

""Sure! As a matter of fact I am scheduled to work on that project right now."" *Opens up another interface and brings in the first file. ""You see, the first 3 fields must be always correct, for a beginner to fill them out wrong he's fired on the spot, the next 4 fields must be filled out correctly, and you might get a reprimand for mistakes"". Now, number 8!""

As he pauses I ask ""what about field number 8?""

""I don't believe field number 8 is of any importance actually, but it's grouped together with the high priority fields."" 
""It's sometimes autocompleted by the system, with info that should go in other fields""

""Okay""

""Some supervisors ask for it to be left empty, or with whatever info is autocompleted in them""

""Okay, so nobody ...""

""Well, look, I have the manual for the project, and field number 8 is actually number 9, look at what it's supposed to contain."" ""Some supervisors ask for field 8 and 9 to be the same.""

""Okay, so there is a worka...""

""No, no, that's not it, when we get return errors on the other fields, almost everyone stumbles into field 8, and we get reprimanded for being late and breaching SLA's""...""I know that the error is in another field, I never check 8""...""the supervisors rely on me to do the error checks for this project""

""Wow"" *there's 120 stations on 30 rows in the hall ""nobody else does errors for this project?"" 

""No, no, they do, but they never finish in time, they always get stuck on what to fill in field 8.""


Part 2: field 8

I pick up my laptop, get my newly minted credentials, hop on the provided virtual machine, which is a monster, containing all of the projects databases.
The entirety of the afternoon is spent looking for and at the project structure.

Next day I begin anew, I look into the reports and the project manual fits perfectly with the automated report system.
The main table does however contain an extra column filled with all types of data, but mostly empty fields ('').

I send an email to the developer listed on the project and ask him about field 8. He replies immediately saying that field 8 was implemented and working in the test environment.

Ok, dead end.

 I need to look at the code: several days later I get access to the source codes. 
Every project has a number in the front, no idea what the number means, searching returns 3 hits, no possibility to narrow down. 
I have to check 3 entire projects with the same keyword in order to find the elusive field 8.

Finally, I find it, it's in the code, but the try catch on it is very lax, and part of it is commented out so basically:

-if it finds the relevant info, it will autocomplete the field

-it can take strings

-it's a non essential field

-it's marked as important

-it's linked to the gibberish column that I discovered earlier.

I copy the class over and add a comment in it(since I wasn't allowed to edit project files) 

-turn off visibility for the field

-return value 1 to column

-add this info for next version for review

I document everything, send it to the Devs, project management, and ops. Job done. Go home

Part 3. Impact

Next day my e-mail has 7 replies. 
The Devs won't budge ""it's an important field"".
Project management "" we won't allow the change""
Operations ""impact is due to lack of user training""

Customer care ""the client is very unhappy with breached SLA's. This is the only project without major issues that is in the top5 customer complaints. Please fix the issue""

3 against, 3 don't care, 1 pro. Most people will find other stuff to play with, or maybe grab a coffee.

 But not me, you see, I can feel when a problem is so annoying, and so damaging that people will blame literally everything else but the problem.
Instead of grabbing a coffee I just went back to operations, in the soul crushing hall, where the little people were suffering because of field number 8.

 I went in to the supervisors office, planted myself in the middle of them and asked for a complete impact report and all error breaches, all documented corrections ever done on this project.

They looked at me and said ""sure, would you like fries with that?""

""Fuck"" I muttered. ""You don't have any of those""

""Look at this place, even if someone would ask us to do them, we would never have enough time for such reports""

""Fine, I'll do it myself, let me know when you get to he error corrections and I'll drive over from the main office.""

One month later I got the impact report.

Field 8 was turning a 30 minute task into a 24 hour ordeal for 3 shifts.

Money wise the project was costing more in penalties due to breached SLA's than it earned.

All supervisors and operators assigned to the project lost their performance bonuses. 
This caused them to ping pong the project around so each would lose 1 month of bonus out of 6 months.

In short, people were simply taking turns getting f***ed in the ... by field number 8. And the company was losing money over it, a lot of money.


Part 4. Money and politics


I hit 'reply to all' and attach my new discoveries to the e-mail.

First replies coming in. 
Dev team. ""Field 8 is working fine""
Project management ""field 8 is essential to the project""
Everyone else wants it removed.

I get my coffee, wait for the lunch break and go in the project management office. 
8 desks, one person.

""Hi, I'm the new guy from support""

""Hello, can I help you?"" She replies

""Yeah, I'm looking for whoever was in charge of project X -number code"", ""btw what do those number codes stand for?""

*She srugs while opening some files

""Ah, it's a long time client, this is one of the newer projects from them, it belongs to colleague X, she will know more""

""Is there a documentation that I might have?""

""Why, is there a problem?"" 

""Is there now? I wouldn't know. I like the name of this project, can you just send me the specs, nothing special, just the main outlines?""

""I have here some versions, I can't figure out which is the final one, I'll just send them all over. Have fun!""

""I will, I promise, thanks btw, nice meeting you.""

Now the final piece of the puzzle. She had sent me a gold mine of info for that project. For the sake of sanity I will explain quickly:

Project X was requested 11 months prior, took 1 month from design to enter production and went through 4 versions.
First version was very similar to the one in actual production.
Second version was expanded to include more types of files (basically a double project)
Third version was a scale down of second version and the infamous field number 8 was added as mandatory.

Drumroll:
Version 4 expanded the scope again and only 20% of project files had info for field number 8.

During testing the customer requested the REMOVAL OF FIELD NUMBER 8 info FROM REPORTS since 80% of it was not there in the first place.

Field number 8 was PAID FOR EXTRA and MORE since it came in LATE at v3.
Since customer asked for REMOVAL of field 8 info from REPORTS and did not SPECIFY REMOVAL FROM CODE, it was LEFT as is LIVE IN PRODUCTION because it was PAID FOR.

9 months in production, huge amounts of money down the drain and finally the mistery was revealed: project management did not want to refund the customer due to technicalities and Devs would not change the project file because they never received the request.

Finally I got a meeting with the heads of each department, pointed out the issue and how to solve it and field number 8 was removed.

*Explanation:  Now I know what you're thinking.  $C is so dumb that she has been holding the paper preventing it from feeding.  But that is not the case.  $C was holding the ass end of the paper up, while copying.  On the document tray of the copier there are sensor flags.  The flags detect the length of the paper.  The paper being used was LGL sized paper.  Because $C was holding the paper up, it couldn't sense the paper size.  And would jam because the paper was too long.*

716,The pit of despair,"Got reminded of another tale at The Complicated Complex  

Cast:    
$T - myself  (uncanny resemblance to Westley)   
$Floor - working closely with Murphy as an undefined variable      
$ROUS - Not seen, but wouldn't be out of place there     

Imagine the network core for the building is 3 racks worth of what used to be a rather expansive raised floor datacenter (multi-thousands of square feet/furlongs/meters)

One day, I was tasked to swap a fiber jumper and patch in a new VoIP port and find a surprise literally lurking in the shadows as the outer lighting sucked in the cavern anyways.

It's a bit darker in here than usual, another set of lights must be buggered as I reach for the switch and step into air on what was supposed to be \~2ft off the ground.

Murphy - Guess what? You've fallen for one of the classic blunders!    
The floor is gone!    
$T - \*screams internally\* Inconcievable!  

Imagine your standard-issue tech now hanging on the door trying not to die

Protip - in an emergency, an ada-compliant door handle is strong enough to bear the weight of a tech (or ROUS)  and slow down the acceleration to not break an ankle.

Once the initial shock wears off, I climb down into the pit (going around the fire swamp) hop up to the platform now surrounding just the network racks and finish the patch.

Told the bossman and sent the maintenance team a strongly worded email that they need to put up notice and signs about works being done in the datacenter.

$Maint replies: Oh yeah, we sold the flooring for scrap...

\*record scratch\*       
Wait... WHAT?     
You made a safety hazard for money?    

My supervisor took over after that, but he was not happy about the selling of near-vital infrastructure and they never did rebuild the floor or give us stairs off the ramp.",81,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF698DC0>

I take a step outside into the corridor. Hmm, i can definitely hear a buzzing noise. I have a quick look through the windows, and i can see the groundskeepers running along the verges with their ride-on lawnmower.

718,"""Our new offices are ready to be set up!""","Basically we're moving our users into a temp office while their main one is being renovated. We get the call that they have all their stuff in their new space ready to be hooked up so we tell them we'll be over there in a few minutes (the temp office is across the street from the main one). They say great, they're going to go to lunch while we take care of business and be out of our way and also let us know they will be going out to a place thats about half an hour away. All good. 

My coworkers and I get over there and find their offices. They were set up and their desks all nice and how they wanted them. However we were now seeing some problems. They had the movers put their giant filing cabinets not only in front of wall outlets, they had them put in front of wall ports! And when I mean giant, they were giant. A single one weighed a couple hundred easily when it was full, and they were all full. The truly frustrating thing about this is that we emailed every department that was being moved to make sure the movers didn't put their shit in front of the drops or outlets. 

To make matters worse the only tech related stuff they had over in their offices were their monitors and printers. We couldn't find their actual laptops nor their docking stations anywhere. We scoured each and every box and filing cabinet just to be sure. Finally we ended up calling them on their lunch and they told us ""Oh yeah, all of our laptops are in this car we drove to lunch in the town 30 mins away, we'll just let you know when you get back!""

Okay great, what about all of your stuff blocking access to literally everything we need to get you guys connected? ""Oh sorry we didn't think that'd be much of a problem! Guess we'll call the movers to come back and rearrange too!"".

So yeah their office won't be ready until Friday now since the movers' are on schedule for the other departments and we'll be busy with those ones as well. Seriously how do you think you're ready for us to set you up if you take the things we need to set up with you????

I needed something installing, and it required the service desk to install but also require me to mess about with java files, appdata, shortcuts pointing to the correct jar file etc...

It took us both a fair bit of time to actually make the software work as intended. Then, I updated our instructions and sent it to them, so when someone from our department needs that particular bit of software, there's specific instructions on how to go about it.

That will hopefully reduce the time taken to install the software from about 30 minutes messing around with it, to about just 10 minutes",81,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF698EE0>

Looking into it, we see that the traffic is coming from a terminal server, towards a domain controller, the user is on a Windows account which has low level admin rights, like a junior admin. After a analyzing the logs, and not seeing anything else suspicious we decide to just call the user. He had the following explanation:

>""I was trying to see what the IP was on a host, so I wanted to do a NSLOOKUP of that host, but I forgot the include the hostname"" 

(this matches what we saw, just a ""nslookup.exe being run from the windows event 4688"").

>""Then I got into the nslookup program, but I didnt realise it, so I typed LS to see which folder I was because it looked odd. I realised that I was inside NSLOOKUP so I just exited the command and tried again with hostname included. I dont even know what a zone transfer is.""

And that was when I realized that if you do that, it's the same as typing ""nslookup -ls"" which actually does an AXFR query towards the primary DNS server, which in this case was also the domain controller.

721,I didn't think anything bad would happen if I disconnected it,"So I work for an international robotics company that is primarily used in healthcare. The robots drive around hospitals and deliver medications and lab samples to various departments as well as carry dirty and clean linens. They run pretty smoothly and are good at navigating around just about any obstacle that comes in their path. Our help desk monitors them all day and makes tickets on any issues that arise. And anything that is hardware-related that occurs gets sent to us in Service, where I work. We source techs either from our company or third party to make repairs to our equipment. I'm the most senior person next to our boss but will soon be replacing him as he is retiring. Anyway, with all that said, what happened over the weekend was nothing short of scummy and downright dangerous.

I was on call for the weekend but was able to do all my work from home. Not too busy at all. Well I get a call on Sunday morning at 5 AM from help desk saying there'd been an accident with one of our robots at a local hospital. It hit a nurse and they were knocked over and got hurt. So I went to the office and got my tools and parts I thought I'd need and headed out. Immediately I saw the problem: a sensor was damaged and someone covered it up by disconnecting it so our software wouldn't catch it (it's complicated). Well this robot has a blind spot when making a u-turn, and this sensor was essentially its blindspot mirror. And a nurse happened to be standing right in its path and ran over her foot and she fell down.

I was fuming but made my repair, got it working and immediately got on the phone with help desk and asked who worked on it last. He gave me the name of one of our newer people and I told him to call him and get his ass to the office. I got back and both the new guy and my boss were there. We went in the break room and I just unloaded on him. No threats or anything like that, but calling him every insulting thing under the sun. Even I surprised myself with what I was saying. I eventually had to step away and that's when I heard my boss tell him ""You're done"". He was fired that day.

Like I said above, I don't regret what I said. Not at all. And the reason I was so mad wasn't just because of his negligence and stupidity. But because I had to miss breakfast with my daughter.

722,"The Dreaded ""Upgraded"" Boards","Disclaimer: LTL, FTP. Also not an actual tech support worker; I'm one of those ""IT wizards"" who also happens to **intensely** look into all the tech my school uses, in case I have to *wizzard*.

Cast:

Me: A small wizzard, slowly beginning to gather an Aura of IT Prowess

Teacher: A poor teacher who got hit by the first wave of the ""upgrade"".

$School: The school, famous for buying whatever is new and shiny, and either being super paranoid and putting an insane amount of restrictions on that make it basically useless, or forgetting about it altogether.

Old Board (OB): The old touchscreen boards. Great, but expensive and proprietary.

New Board (NB): The new touchscreen boards. Cheap, but cheap.

Context:

Around 8 years ago, the teachers at $School got these big, bulky touchscreen boards. They had two components, a projector and a screen with pen and touch input. Each part had to be individually calibrated, powered, and connected. In other words, they were a huge pain. 

Except they weren't. The classrooms have seriously adapted to these hulking beasts. The calibration takes a few seconds, and every teacher knows how to do it. The boards have been given their own power sockets, which (probably) have their own higher power output. The teachers have also gotten really creative with integrating the boards into their lessons. But there's still the problem of the projector. All the projectors use proprietary light bulbs, which cost a ton each year. I'm assuming that's the main reason that $School switched.

Around 6 months ago, I was checking the $Schools Technology Resources website.

Website: ""$School no longer installs OBs.  NBs are a **better and lower-cost alternative.**""

I'm sure everyone here knows what that means.

Me: ""Welp. Here we go again.""

&#x200B;

Fast forward to today, and the NBs start arriving. Apparently, the teachers weren't told until the day of. I don't know how true that is, but they definitely didn't receive much training. Or any training. At all. I walk into class to check these things out.

They. Are. MASSIVE.

Hulking giants compared to the already-huge OB. And half of the right side is taken up by a giant profile picture.

 Teacher takes out the pen, and opens up the OB's slides app. Not the greatest idea, but they've had these lesson plans for 8 years, and they didn't know about this until NOW. So, Teacher lays the pen on the board, and begins to draw a straight line on the graph.

L A G. Sooooo much lag. The line was at least 8 inches away from the pen.

And then the best setting ever activates. 

Hold to right click.

On a board marketed for drawing and similar activities.

So Teacher's spending time exiting the right-click menus, which takes forever because the laggy mouse input rolls over the menus and causes them to open again.

You think it's a driver issue? THERE'S NO DRIVER.

Calibrate the board? Do you have an hour or two to go through the settings?

Menus? Where? 

Long story short, I'm coming in to help this poor teacher. And everyone else, eventually. Maybe I'll make a part 2 if something interesting happens.

726,The student employee with the (alleged) power to change your online banking password,"Finally, a story for this subreddit!

Cast:

$Me: Uh... me

$Co-worker: Another student employee

$User: Older gentleman, self proclaimed ""technology virgin""

&#x200B;

So, for a bit of background, I'm a college student who works at our on-campus IT Help Desk. One of the things we directly interact with users for is password resets. On this particular day, a faculty member (not teaching staff, just a university employee) comes in to the desk in person looking for help filling out the campus conflict of interest form. As a project for his internship with the IT department of our campus, one of our other student employees created an online web app for submitting COI forms, and this is the first semester it is being used.

Anyways, this user apparently doesn't know his password because he almost never uses his university account. So, naturally, we go through the process of a password reset. Being student employees, our policy is that we can only do student password resets; staff password reset tickets can be created by us, but must be completed by Network Services. So, we create a password reset ticket for $user.

&#x200B;

So, here's how our first exchange went (paraphrasing, btw).

$Co-worker: We'll get a ticket sent off to Network Services. We'll give you a call once your password is ready. What's your phone number?

\*user immediately rattles of two phone numbers like he's an auctioneer. My coworker had to ask for him to repeat it about 5 times just so he could pick out the numbers bit by bit as the user says his numbers as fast as possible each time.\*

$Co-worker: Perfect, someone will give you a call as soon as Network Services has reset your password.

$User: Well, I'll just come back in an hour, how's that.

\*leaves\*

&#x200B;

So, an hour later, our user comes back, this time with me as the only employee currently at the IT desk.

$Me: Here's your new password, I'll write it down on a sticky note for you

$User: So this won't change my password, right? Cause as it is, my phone when I log in shows those little stars and enters my password for me (\*is describing autofill)

$Me: Well, yes, this does change your password, but . . .

$User: Well, shoot!! I don't want it to change my password!

$Me, internally: \*if you don't know your password, how do you expect to log in if we don't give you a new password?...\*

$Me: . . .you can always change your password once you're logged in to be anything you choose.

$User: So this changed my phone password, like for my bank and everything else??

$Me: . . . . . No, this only changed your password for university services. (\*wondering how a person could possible think a student employee at their university's help desk has the power to change their BANKING password\*)

$User: Oh, okay, that's good. If it changed my other passwords I'd have to go talk to {person} to have them fix my phone again. They do all of my technology stuff for me. So now how do I do the conflict of interest form?

$Me: Well, I don't have the link to the form handy, but when my co-worker who made the form is at work later today, I'll get the link from him and email it to you so you can fill it out.

$User: Don't bother, I'm a technology virgin, I don't know what I'm doing. When does your co-worker come in?

$Me: 11am

$User: Great, I'll see you at 11 so you can walk me through it.

&#x200B;

For a bit of context, this COI form is ridiculously easy to use. As long as you're logged in, it auto-fills your name and department. All you have to do is enter your birthday and phone number (i believe, don't quote me on that) and either check or un-check boxes of different kinds of conflicts of interests you may or may not have. That's it. It's a perfect replica of the physical form that used to be used, but yet we've gotten tons of complaints that ""the new form is more complicated"" because apparently online = complicated, no exceptions. There have also been users who claim the form is broken because they ignore the note in the form that shows the exact format they need to have their phone number in for the form to be accepted.

&#x200B;

EDIT: The user came back later, and in true ""technology virgin"" style... didn't know what my coworker meant when he asked him to ""scroll down"" on the page, and had to be shown the scroll wheel on the mouse.

Client: There is no start Zoom button.

Me: Are you on page X of the learning platform?

Client: No I'm on page Y.

728,documentation woes,"in this fine sub, we often hear about the need for documenting one's path to a resolution where one is not screwed over, because.. some dumbass that don't know shit said do it in a stupid way.

i hold good documentation sacred.

i had read hundreds of process control documents by this point in my assembly career, which began in 1977.

back in the 90's i once got a 3 buck an hour raise for working on documentation, and i got that promotion by talking to All my internal customers about what they do and what i need to correct to help them proceed in their various tasks.

 my job was to start with their callout of a manufacturing problem, and initiate drawing and work instruction changes. normally this was an engineering task at my company. 

i did well enough on a huge backlog of ""gripes"" that a new job category was created ... i was the first Engineering Aide in my very successful company years before this tale of woe.

later at the redmond rocket factory, i had already seen an 18 year vibe shop veteran get fired for ""not following the documentaion""

i had already seen one of our program engineers try to force the vibe commander to follow incomplete and error filled vibe test instructions.

so, Jaime called me to his side one day as he was building a space shuttle spare engine. showed me the latest rev. of his shuttle engine assembly documentation.  i had read the previous revision. it was magnificent in it's conciseness.  told me everything i needed to know, and i was not even allowed to touch that flight hardware.

i would often be staring over his shoulder, drooling like a one year old as he assembled space shuttle engines. he would later win a sliver snoopy award from nasa, presented by an astronaut, as i watched with tears flowing down my cheeks.

someone with little understanding was telling Jaime how to make good ones.  that pompous ass may have never made a good one in his life. the doc writer never listened to Jaime about what he needed.

i could not believe how the original, concise, useful document was so corrupted.  three times the wordage, and all it did was confuse Jaime, the master of making good ones.

729,The white isn't white enough,"Not sure if it really counts as tech support but here goes...

I'm a web and graphic designer, and I designed a flyer for one of my clients. I sent the design to her via email. It's really hard to match colours from the screen to print, especially since monitor colours don't match up to their local office printer. Plus screen colours are in RGB, so there are literally some colours that are unachievable in a physical print. Usually, for exact colour matching, we have to use Pantone swatches or when they send it for the actual print, they can sort it out and tweak with the actual technician.

I received a call immediately, and she mentioned that she printed out the flyer on their company's office printer. I readied myself for the usual spiel about how monitor colours don't match the printout... etc. etc...

Conversation goes like this:

Client: 'Hey, I printed this out and the colours don't match what I see on the screen.'

Me: 'Yeah, don't worry about that, every monitor is different and you can't calibrate it to match your office printer. I used the exact CMYK colours for your logo and fonts.

Client: 'Well even so the colours look correct on screen but not when I print it out.'

Me: 'I've used the exact CMYK colours, so you don't have to worry about it. Your professional printer will ensure that you get the right colour.'

Client: 'Yes, but the whites aren't white enough.'

I was quickly checked my file, did I leave a translucent layer on by accident? No, it was perfectly #FFFFFF.  Told her that the white is as white as it can be.

Client: 'Well, the white ink is not very white.'

I was stunned. Office and home printers don't have... white ink. It's just the white paper. Any white areas are basically just paper that hasn't been printed on.

I tried hard to explain this concept to her. That printers don't print the white. Regardless, she insists that they do. I tell her that it cannot be done on an office/home printer, it literally requires a separate offset printing plate that only large commercial printers use. And even then, seldom do people print white at all.

She insists that her printer does print white, and that the design I sent her simply isn't white enough.

I tell her maybe her paper stock isn't white? Maybe the paper itself is yellowish?

Client: 'No, it's not my paper, it's that your white isn't white enough. Look, I've used some of my liquid white-out on the paper. It's very white. Your design is not printing the white colours properly.'

I was flabbergasted. Couldn't laugh out loud. She literally used white-out on the print-out and complained that the correction fluid was whiter than the paper.

Can't really remember what happened after, but she showed her boss and he seemed happy with the design. So everything went well I suppose.",146,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF69A2E0>
730,The Previous Technician Knew What They Were Doing,"I was working help desk as a Tier 1 technician, and I was working from home because of the pandemic. I was employed at a managed services provider that had multiple clients across various industries. For some clients, when their users called in, I was a glorified ticket maker, and for others I followed a simple checklist providing basic trouble shooting steps. 

As for our major clients, I followed an extensive list. That usually involved holding their user's hand through step-by-step instruction document or walking them through hardware checks. Frequently, I would remote in to check/fix various settings, collect logs/screenshots, contact vendors, and running scripts, patches, etc. 

Slap a bandaid on it to get the system and/or the person working. That was our supreme goal. Otherwise, the issue(s) are escalated to Tier 2 which was the client's corporate/internal IT. Overall, this was not very fulfilling because I always wanted to do more and spend more time on things. However, at least I got a lot of exposure as well as strengthened - and sometimes flexed - my customer service skills.

Anyways, the other techs and I would often reminisce on what collective trope a major client's users were spitting at us. Generally, they said these things out of spite. One that we frequently suffered, when informing users the issue had to be escalated, they would exclaim, ""The previous technician knew what they were doing."" 

Followed by some flavor of ""How come they were able to fix this but not you?""

""Can I talk to the previous technician?""

""I want to talk to your boss."" 

And so...

much....

more...

For your context, at the time of the story, I had been at this organization for about a year, and well acquanted with much of everything. Things clicked and I was in my stride. Irate, insulting, and incorrigible callers no longer negatively affected my mood or energy. I was a zen professional.

So I was at the tail end of my shift, sometime in the evening, when a user called in about some issue. A polite, elderly genetleman who had troubles with some of the company's proprietary software. After remoting in and investigating, it appeared to be something I had dealt with before, but whatever the case, I had to soldier on. Within the realm of what I was allowed to do, I exhausted all efforts. I let the user know I had to escalate the issue to Tier 2.

Unsurprisingly, the user started to berate me, ""The previous technician knew what they were doing."" Then followed up about how they talked to a technician several hours ago that was an expert and quickly resolved their earlier issues.

My eyes widened as I recognized I had talked this user earlier. I checked the call history, and I was the only other person they spoke with that day. I felt a rush of excitement, but I quickly contained myself. 

I verbally acknowledged and let the user elaborate. It was back and forth scorning me and praising the previous technician. They condemned me further going so far as to accuse me of being new. All the while, unbeknowst to the user praising me, stating the previous technician demonstrated expert skills and was knowledgeable in all things IT and customer service.

The user's insolence probably took up a good five minutes. Plenty of rope had been laid out at this point. I think there was a brief moment of silence indicating the user had ran out of gas. 

I was a rock dropped in water. I can imagine the ripples of emotion develop on his face as I listened with glee the audible stammers and fumbling of words over the phone and his wife's sudden outburst of laughing as I responded, ""Sir, that previous technician was me.""

There was another weak and helpless attempt or two to deflect. I quickly affirmed that I was the previous technician going into further details of our earlier encounter. Then once again informed them I was escalating the issue to Tier 2. The user meekly uttered an okay and hung up the phone.",77,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF69A340>
731,"Red wire, black wire, white wire…. Oops","A friend of a friend (long story) had a skee ball game they wanted me to try fixing for them. It was one of the first to have circuit boards, so I didn’t really know what to expect. However, there is good news: schematics are available. The bad news is that the wiring to the bottom half is somewhat butchered and some of the connectors are cracked and would need replacement.

After replacing the damaged power cord, I plugged it in and it appears that the motherboard at least boots up. The screen animates in what I call a “zeroing around” pattern. I can see missing segments but that may be an easy thing to fix: These older machines actually used incandescent bulbs behind the segments. But first, I need to find the wires for the coin switch, and see if the logic responds to that and starts the game.

On the schematic, I find that the coin switches go to the 3 pin connector that has the color code, white, red and black. No problem! I find a handy little wire, and stick it between the red and black wires, and POP! The machine looses power.  

Watt? Well, darn. I guess I blew the fuse. So I take the fuse out and FSCK! The fuse is intact! Now I’m really getting that sinking feeling that I just made a very expensive and embarrassing mistake. The lights in the room are still on, so I don’t think the fuse in the house blew, because most houses have the outlets and lights in a given room on the same circuit. However, where does this extension cord go, exactly?

I follow it to a power strip… which is receiving no power even though the switch is on. I follow that to the outlet, and you guessed it, the GFCI has turned off. I press reset and HALLELUJAH! The game comes back on, completely unharmed!   
 Reexamining the entire schematic before touching anything else, I figure out what I did. The ball release solenoid runs on the high voltage AC from the wall, using a simple triac to turn it on. They used the same wire colors on the connectors for the ball release solenoid as they did for the coin switches. The ground wire was red instead of green, but white is still neutral and black is still live. So, I had connected live directly to ground! Thankfully I didn’t use a bare paper clip for that purpose or I’d probably be dead.  

In the manufacturer’s defense, the 2 connectors are far enough away from each other that the wires for the “wrong” one would be too short to actually plug them in together. So in the end this was really my fault for not reading the entire schematic (or indeed, the entire PAGE of said schematic) before I started crossing wires!  

There had been times in the past where I had gone down the rabbit hole of tracing out every single line and trying to understand what everything meant, thus tripling the time it took me to repair something because I didn’t see the forest through the trees (e.g. missing a broken solder connection or obviously burned out transistor, connector that works if you push on it, or whatever) so that is why I jumped at the opportunity to just say “Okay, I found what I’m looking for, let’s try this!”

By the way, if the title sounds familiar, it is a paraphrasing of a kid’s book my Mom used to read me, where it would say something like “red socks blue socks white socks” and then “oops” with a picture of, for example, someone putting the socks on their hands instead of their feet, putting their shirt on backwards, or whatever.  

TL;DR: Read the entire schematic first, or trace the wire all the way to the source! Otherwise, you might fry the machine or worse, yourself!",33,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF69A3A0>
732,The Quantum Computer,"Scene: Its late evening, im just coming into work and the coffee hasn't yet had a chance to settle. I spark up the command center and log into the system and am greeted with a ticket of a user complaining that their computer is overheating. 

After reading the ticket I gleaned that the user was likely putting their computer(laptop) in sleep mode and in order to prevent the fans from running they would need to shut the computer off in order for it to not heat up their bag / overheat the computer.

I typed up an email to ask the standard questions, get back that indeed they are putting it into sleep mode because:

""I need all of my applications to be open on the pages I need them to be when I open my computer, i don't want to wait for it to load up, just help me find a setting that allows me to keep the computer cool.""

I reply back that there are basically two options(due to company policy we do not use hibernate), sleep mode and power off. Type up a nice email and that is all I hear for two days. 

Two days later *spongebob voice*

I get a phonecall in the que of a man so pissed off he can barely talk, and references his ticket number. I pull it up and wouldn't you know it, its the overheating computer user. 

I go over troubleshooting again, establishing the issue, what is happening and why and explain to the user that they will need to decide between sleep mode and turning the PC off, they then explode at me and declare that I: ""JUST NEED YOU TO FIX IT, YOU GUYS KNOW HOW TO DO THIS I KNOW YOU DO"". 

""Sir if you figure out how to make a computer be both off and on simultaneously please, let me know because I want to come work for you.""

-is what I wish I had said.

734,When BYOD is no longer allowed. L,"Hello everyone. 

I have an interesting story for you folks.

User: hello IT, this is finance. I can't access the network at all. Not even the internet.

Me: strange, okay I'm coming. I go down and I see that she's not getting an IP address. I'm thinking okay, strange. So I ask did anyone come and use this docking station? She's like yes, the finance director bought his personal laptop and he  connected this blue cable to it but it didn't work. Then I realised what has happened. Port security kicked in, shutting down the port.

I go back to my desk and reset the port allowing the user to continue her work. But now, I need to raise an incident report and get the finance director to sign it, but he refuses. I call my manager and he tell him that he's refusing to sign. 


My manager goes to the CEO and gets him involved. After informing of what happened, BYOD was no longer allowed..

EDIT: WiFI was added after the incident, but it was only for Mobile phones and staff members had to sign forms to allow them to connect.",362,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF69A4C0>
735,Can you reset my password? Again?,"  

While I don't work in IT, it never seems to fail that I become the ""Tech Guy"" and get asked to do all the tech stuff on top of my regular job. I work in public safety, so we weren't exactly hired for our computer skills and our agency is not really big enough to justify a dedicated IT position. I was given the task (among several other things) of creating and deleting user accounts and resetting passwords for our records software.

My biggest headache of course was re-setting locked accounts. Some people forget to type their username when logging in and end up locking the last user’s account quite often, while others seem to just always forget their password. But one user always seemed to have trouble. Also, most people do not have one computer they always use. There are many computers and users won’t likely use the same computer one day to the next. This will come up later.

I get an e-mail from a user one morning that their password isn't working. I log in and see that they have 9 failed password attempts, which meant not only did they type the wrong password 3 times and disable their account, they tried six more times after being told ""Contact your system administrator.” Not unusual and it might not even be their fault as mentioned above. I unlock the account, give them a generic temporary password, and go on about my day.

A few hours later I get a call from the same user.

**User:** That password isn’t working. I typed “some\_generic\_passowrd”, and it isn’t working.

**Me:** That’s the correct password. I’ll reset it right now and you can try to log in.

**User:** Nope, still not working.

I see the failed log in attempt under his profile so at least I know they got their username right. Since I have them on the phone, I give them a super simple password and have them log in.

**User:** \[lots and I mean LOTS of typing and clicking\] It’s still not work… oh wait, there we go. It says my password expired. I thought you just reset it for me.

**Me:** Yes, but it is only temporary. You have to create your own password now and it has to have be \[list of requirements\]. Make sure it is something you will remember.

**User:** OK, thanks.

I don’t think much of it and go about my day. A few days later I get an e-mail from **User** asking to reset their password. They’re super apologetic about it but honestly, it’s just a forgotten password; I’ve had worse calls \[like someone deleting an entire person by accident\]. Oddly the account is not locked out and there are no failed log in attempts, so I give them a call.

**Me:** Hey I got your e-mail, it’s ok. Your account shows it isn’t locked and I don’t see any failed log in attempts. Are you using your username? What is it telling you when you try to log in?

**User:** \[lots of typing and clicking\] It says “Could not establish a connection to the server” I typed my username and password and that’s all that happens.

That’s not unheard of.

**Me:** That’s not unheard of. Close the log in prompt and try again. Make sure you let me know what you are doing and what messages show up.

**User:** \[walking me through each step they’re taking\] And I’m in, you fixed it!

**Me:** Ok, sounds good to me, have a good day!

This happens a few more times over the next several weeks and they are never able to really explain what happens before I get involved. Inevitably by time they get me on the phone it seems to be working again. There are several times where I again notice they don’t have any failed log in attempts and their account is not locked. I do reset their password a few times but never end up having too much trouble getting them in with a little patience.

Fast forward a few months and my co-worker and I are asked to assist with a server migration. One task is to go to each computer in the building and enter the new server configuration, update the software, and re-name the old server settings. This is accessed from a settings button on the log in screen. A new dialogue box allows you to select an existing server configuration or create a new one. I set up the first few computers without an issue, but then I come to a computer that I know **User** uses quite often.

I open the server configuration settings and there are TEN servers listed. The legacy server, the test server and 8 servers with variations of **User**’s username or full name. I open the settings for the first one and I find something like:

**Server Address:** \[user’s username\]

**Port:** \[super\_simple\_password\]

I find variations of this for every additional server entry in the list. This explains everything; the loads of clicking and typing and the “Could not establish a connection to server” was **User** going into settings and creating, and saving, a new server each time. I chuckled and called **User** over. We chalked it up to they were never shown how to properly log in and they had a laugh too. **User** was happy, they didn’t have to keep asking for new passwords, and we didn’t have to keep resetting them. By the end of the update, I found around 5 more times where this was done on other computers.",21,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF69A520>
736,Don't Mind Me ... I'm Just Tech Support,"Here's a story from my last deployment to Iraq (I used to be a 'SIGO,' which is kind of like a help-desk manager for the Army) - 

Received a call from the Operations Officer (no, I'm not going to explain what an Ops Officer does, or explain any other Army acronyms, abbreviations, or jargon. This post would be ridiculously long) telling me he needed a new VoIP phone (we used VOIP phones on our classified network, POTS phones for unclassified calls), because his was broken. Since I took care of all officer issues personally, I grabbed a spare phone of the shelf and headed over to his office. When I arrived, he was on the POTS phone talking to a buddy from another unit. He gave me a disdainful look, and pointed to his VOIP phone, which was sitting on the printer in his office. When I picked it up, bits of plastic fell off, the screen was cracked in multiple places, and the handset was held together by the wires inside. 

Jeezus? WTH happened to this poor phone? 

Oh well, phone surely doesn't work. I plugged in the spare, and checked that it worked correctly. I was waiting for the Ops O to get off the phone to tell him the new VOIP phone was ready for him when I overheard this:

""Yeah, I am getting a new VOIP phone. I got mad at what I heard and threw the old one against the wall.""",30,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF69A580>
737,Just do what the screen says,"TL;dr below. 

I changed careers a few years ago. I have a couple of degrees in computer maintenance and networking technology. I got tired of doing that and made a career change into industrial maintenance. I work for a major food producer now and work on everything from bearings and grease to electrical and printers. I've only done this for about 3 years now. Most of you reading this in the US have my product in your refrigerator right now. 

One of the machines goes down this morning. It is a very advanced machine. Kind of crazy all of the technology used on it. I come over to the call late to see if I can help. One of my fellow mechanics is there along with our lead. I'm just a bystander at this point. They call in our supervisor, he calls his supervisor, and another lead shows up. There are 6 of us working on this machine. 

I poke around a bit based on the error on the screen. I talk to my lead and tell him what I think it is. I'm kinda brushed off, ignored. I watch a little longer. I speak up again and am ignored They're pulling the machine apart checking on different things. 

We've been here for an hour at this point and I'm freezing my ass off. Plus the company is losing between$15-20k an hour that the equipment is down. I look at my buddy and say ""hand me your dykes bro"" I reach down and clip a zip tie off some cables while everyone else is looking at something else. 

I look up and everyone is staring at me... the big boss incredulously asks, ""what did you do???""

At first I'm thinking I f**ked up and accidentally cut something I shouldn't have... ""I cut a zip tie...""

""All the errors just went away, show me what you did!""

I proceed to show them that I cut a zip tie off of a multi-mode fiber jumper that was causing a kink (not really a kink, but a sharp bend). Then I had to explain that fiber shouldn't have a bend > 30 degrees. 

This machine has about 8 drives that control servo motors, each drive is in series with the drive next to it linked with MM tx/rx jumpers between them. 

Errors on the screen: ""checksum failed"" ""check fiber optic cables""... ""x1 drive checksum error"" ""check fiber optic cables""... ""x2 drive checksum error"" and so on...

This isn't to degrade them in any way, they are all extremely intelligent and they would normally run circles around me. If fact, I'll probably end up calling them for help by days end!

He tells me her spacebar is broken and asks if I can supply her with another keyboard. I said ""sure no problem"" as we have dozens of them. They wear out and get replaced from time to time. No biggie. 

I grab one that's in decent condition and head on over. They both greet me and he gives me a weird look and says, ""Here's the old one..."" and hands me a keyboard with a literally broken spacebar. As in a spacebar key actually broken in half. I say ""Oh okay so it's actually broken."" I ask her ""How'd that happen?"" 

She says, ""I don't even know! It just broke somehow! I don't even know when it broke."" 

Ok. Sure.

The other guy cracks a few jokes about her typing too hard and we all have a few laughs about it. She obviously knows how it broke and while I generally don't care about these kind of things but I can't help but wonder what the hell she did to that keyboard. She's also broken a calculator, a mouse, the multiple badges in my previous post here, and a laminating machine. Now I recall another keyboard she spilled soda on when a first started. I've worked at the company for about 2yrs

I forward the info up the chain when stuff breaks but no one seems to notice that most of the hardware that breaks around here can be traced back to one person or if they do they don't care.

So our FNG is out on a customer visit. Even after the previous fiasco of not knowing how to find his IP he has been sent out to upgrade the OS of a clients internet router that terminates multiple T1s. Shocker he screws it up. So it’s now 3am and they have no internet. The customer and FNG are hanging out in front of a Starbucks trying to download this massive file because hotspots weren’t quite a thing yet. 

FNG is wandering around the vendor’s site trying to find the correct file talking to himself and getting frustrated. It’s about this time that the customer notices some movement in his side mirror. He tells FNG not to make any sudden moves. A moment later two officers guns drawn kindly ask them to step out of the vehicle. Apparently this Starbucks had been robbed repeatedly. We send another engineer out to complete the work as the engineer decides he’s done for the night the engineer managed to delete the OS file and replace it will a config for a switch we have never heard of.  We don’t know where he got the config file but he renamed it to os.txt. 

I would like to say that he stayed around for more adventures but right as the company was about to let him go he managed to break his arm falling in a network closet while getting tangled up in cat5 cable. They waited until workers comp paid to fix his arm and then let him go. He seemed relieved not to have to continue the charade.

742,That time I kicked someone in the crotch over TCP/IP,"Been a while since I last posted, but I just remembered this story today. It's short and sweet, so here goes.

I work as a Senior Software Engineer at a small software company. Being a small company, I wear multiple hats. I handle gathering requirements, developing software, project deployment and post-deployment support. The whole lifecycle. One of the software packages I am responsible for is our Point of Sale software, that integrates with our company's flagship software package.

As it is my software, I handle new deployments and support cases for this product. Many of our clients prefer us to remote in to their PoS terminal to solve issues, rather than coming on-site. This saves them a callout fee, so they're happy enough to have someone on-hand to help with anything that can't be done remotely. Mostly this involves hardware testing. ""Okay, scan a barcode. That scanned? Good. Did the receipt come out? Does it look right?"" You know the drill.

One of our clients was having issues with their receipt printer and cash drawer. This hardware was very old, and updates to the PoS software had caused a compatibility issue with their hardware drivers. Luckily, updating the hardware driver package for the receipt printer/cash drawer and setting the devices up again resolved the issue.

I was on the phone with one of the store clerks for this particular client, testing out the hardware. We'd just tested the receipt printer, which printed perfectly. Final thing to test was the cash drawer. I'm sure you can see where this is going.

Me: ""Okay, that's working. Now we're going to test the cash drawer. I'm going to kick the drawer, and you tell me if it opens or not.""

Clerk: ""Okay.""

Me: \*clicks button\*

Random customer: ""Excuse me...""

Cash drawer: \*ka-chunk\*

Clerk: ""Oof!""

As soon as I clicked the ""No Sale"" button, a customer tried to get the attention of the clerk at the terminal. The cash drawer popped, and the clerk turned towards the customer, and caught himself right on the edge of the drawer as it was springing out.

Me: ""Well... that sounds like it worked...""

And that's how I literally kicked someone in the jimmy over the internet.",108,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF69A7C0>
743,A bit of a missile problem.,"Way back when a friend worked in support for a large aircraft / missile manufacturer.  Since gone and absorbed.  One of their products was the Harpoon missile designed to attack ships.  

One Scandinavian country owned some.  These things needed periodic maintenance.  Among other things you ran a fake launch and it would “fly” to its target.  You could see fins move and monitor the internals and such.  Two guys were working on it.  They turned the key and the thing fired off!  One of them was even standing on it.  

So now you’ve got this unguided missile roaring through the harbor full of ships.  Somehow it managed to miss everything and make it five miles inland before it hit a house.  Nobody injured.

hell, he taught me how to cryo-press the four teflon valve seats and let me handwind the four valve solenoids that were attached in series feeding the 200 pound thrust engine.

boss had trained me to perfection on those processes.

i was the last asked to speak during this meet.  two foci for these critical vibe runs, the vibe commander must conform to the vibe profiles...sine, random...etc.

while i will be hand placing 2 million dollars onto the vibe fixture, then vibe commander and i binding dozens of bolts to 55 foot pounds. then i hook up pressure, then i measure pressure, using very old apollo era leak detection technology. this was gonna be very difficult inside the vibe containment.  not much space to set up the sight glass/gas board as they called it back in the last century.

i am so scared of what may go wrong, as i might be the obvious cause

i had heard they want to hook up equipment i had not used before. i said i don't feel good about hooking up this brand new untested gear to flight hardware. then i said i need to be trained how to operate this valve control box.

nobody contradicted me

customer program manager had audited our vibes for his other goodies before.  he stood up for me and said we shall do these extra steps.

then we made another good one, vibe commander and me, we passed the three day vibe.

with excellent help from customer program manager",56,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF69A880>
745,Tech support is blind,"I'm the family tech support for my parents. My dad is blind and my mom needs to explicitly told to press the button that says ""Continue"" or ""Enter"" when trying to use a new app.

My dad has a website for his law practice. I've done light work over the past decade to help him keep his website up to date. His hosting service offered him a deal where he can get a new website package at less than current monthly cost, which mean he just needs to migrate over the content. Which means \*I\* need to migrate over his content.

Rather than try to find the information I need in his emails, he figured it would be easier for me to log into his email and get the info myself. It was not. I tried to log into his Gmail on my computer. ""This device is not recognized"". It prompted me to confirm from his phone that I'm allowed to access his email. Of course, I don't have his phone with me. I called him and told him about the security measure and what he had to do. I had to explain about 5 times why having his username and password wasn't enough and that he had to verify I wasn't a hacker. He doesn't get it, but he gives my mom his phone to figure out what to do. I tell them multiple times, ""Download the Gmail app. Open the app. Press the YES prompt that pops up. Then enter the number xx"". This turns into a screaming match between my mom and dad, the night is ruined, and I give up for the night with no access to his email.

The next day, I decide to try again. He asks me to walk him through what to do again, and I tell him I literally can't walk him through any clearer than I did last night. He says his clerk is able to help him today, and is more technically proficient than mom (low bar). I text him a screenshot of the instructions. He asks me to text it to his clerk.

Me: I don't have your clerk's number. Just show it to her on your phone.

Dad: I can have her send you a text so that you have her number and can text it to her

Me: Just show her your phone!

Dad: She is home sick today but I can have her text you and you can tell her the instructions

Me: ....Then she cannot help you today. She cannot help if she does not literally have your phone in her hands.

I give up on getting into his email, and decide to try a different approach. Let's just see if I can log into his website portal. I have the URL for the portal, but need his new credentials, so I give him a call.

Me: I'm trying to log into your website, but I don't remember your password.

Dad: It's 12345678

Me: That didn't work.... OK so I'm putting in Username xxx, pass--

Dad: No, they changed how you log in.

Me: OK... so what's the username?

Dad: 123455678

Me: Then what's the password?!

Dad: I don't have a password. They told me I can change it.

Me: \*Bangs my head on my desk until I die\* Then I need access to your email. I can't change your password without getting into your email.

He wanted to try resetting his password himself, so I left him to it, but it's been 20 minutes and I haven't heard back yet. As frustrating as it is doing tech support for my parents I'm honestly really annoyed with Gmail for making it so difficult for a person with disabilities to get into their account (or technically, have someone else get into their account to assist them). I tried alternative methods to recover his gmail account, but it literally won't let me in in any way without having access to his phone, and he can't do the phone part without help. I'm sure he's as frustrated as I am.",22,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF69A8E0>
746,The New Guy Chronicles - Episode 9: The Sound of an Empty Head,"These are the stories of the New Guy. All of what you are about to read is true. I write you these tales of mirth and woe, of entertainment and anger with as much accuracy and as little embellishment as I can manage. Many conversations are written as best I can remember them from my notes and memories about the incidents they describe, but the heart of what you are about to read is as true as I can make it.

Names have been changed to protect the innocent. And the guilty. 

[Episode 8](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/ptz7bs/the_new_guy_chronicles_episode_8_watching_yout_er/)

The cast:

Jordan - FNG

Thomas - Me, the manager and network admin

John - The older of my two other reports, primarily responsible for server maintenance, major application upgrades, and supporting our smaller off-site locations and their specific applications

Daniel - The younger of my two original employees, though here for the same amount of time as John. Both longer than me, actually. Desktop and server support, document management and phone system support, phenomenal people skills.

What is happiness?  No such thing exists in this forsaken place.  All is barren wasteland, void of hope and meaning.  Woe.  Woe upon all you who dare tread here.  Heed my warnings and flee from this place of desolation.  All is-

Alas, I suppose you are here for another tale of Jordan the empty-headed and not my pleas for this company to be bathed in the cleansing fires of ruin and destruction.  Well, let us take a voyage back in time to...

**DAY 99** - The Sound of an Empty Head

A ticket comes in for [department].  They're having trouble watching (actual) training videos on our intranet system.  They can't hear any sound.  Jordan has yet to visit this department in his time here.  It's a little weird because they're actually a separate company that contracts to perform some services for us, but we support their IT needs in this location.  I inform him of the issue and take him down with me to visit.  

Me: ""Hey, [user], having some trouble?""

User: ""Yeah, we can't hear sound when we play videos.""

Me: *looking at the desk* ""Ah, no speakers.  That explains that.  We'll go grab you a set.""

We leave the office to head back to ours.

Jordan: ""So what's the problem?""

Me: ""What do you mean?""

Jordan: ""Well, do you think it's an internal problem or something?""

Me: ""What?  No.""

Jordan: ""Then what's the problem?""

Me: *visible confusion*  ""Do you not know what the problem is?""

Jordan: ""Well they said the speakers weren't working, but you said there were no speakers.""

Me: *visible confusion intensifies*  ""OK...""

Jordan: ""Isn't there an internal speaker?""

Me: ""No.""

*we enter our office*

Jordan: ""So what's the problem with it?""

Bewildered.  Confused.  Mystified.  I could empty a thesaurus into this story and not have the words to adequately describe the feeling of my brain doing a hard reset in that moment.  Jordan has lied, he's misunderstood, he's failed to follow instructions, wasted countless hours, driven users from his presence with his awkwardness, and otherwise proved himself incapable of faithfully discharging his duties.  But this?  This is a new low.  This is an unprecedented, heretofore never seen level of incapacity.  This, in the moment, I cannot handle.  

Blinking away my stupor I turn wordlessly from Jordan to our back storeroom.  I fetch a pair of speakers in a box and place them in his hands.

Me: ""Just... go install these.""

I turn from him, averting my eyes from the dull look upon his face.  Silently weeping with the knowledge that humanity could produce a 20-year-old ostensibly normal adult incapable of understanding ""computer with no noise-maker no make noise"" I slunk back to my office.

He managed to install the speakers.  The speakers managed to produce sounds.  I do not know if he managed to understand the connection.",219,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF69A940>
747,Laptop Webcam - PLS FIX,"We live in the day and age now where online meetings have become common place. In the Before Times, my company was just beginning its transition to Teams and that was quickly expedited as we started to work from home. Of course, everyone and their mother needed a webcam because god help us if we cant see someone in a meeting. From what I understand if you arent on webcam you dont exist and cant contribute, or something like that, given the severity users seem to treat camera issues with.

Whatever. I soldier on, continue my duties, including new hires during the pandemic. Eventually bring on two laptop users, one of which is the $User in question. Give them their thinkpads, give them the IT walkthrough, explain all the usual shit to them ect ect, no problem. They seem competent.

Eventually I get a ticket from $HR: $User's webcam is broken and doesnt work, please repair immediately. Alright fine whatever, its not critical but Ill get pestered endlessly until I at least address this one.

I connect with $User's PC, and camera isnt working as expected. Driver updates, all the usual, nothing at all. Doesnt even show black - just doesnt appear to be there. So I get an idea:

$Me - $User, is the cover over the webcam?

$User - No, no cover

$Me - Do you see a little slide there at the top?

$User - No slide, no cover, sorry

I'm sure you can guess where it's going.

He deals with it for a little until we can both be in the office. He calls me over, and as soon as I see the laptop, I see the slide is in fact: there, and over his camera. I slide it open and walk away to sounds of astonished thanks. Thinkpad camera covers arent just covers - they hard disable the webcam when in place.",39,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF69A9A0>

So I am 21 a college student, i was interning for an elementary school. I am the tech support dude doing the internship, so one day I am doing my regular trouble shooting, cuz that was all i ever did, I hear an announcement, saying I am needed in a certain room, i go in, there is a teacher freaking out mind you she was in her mid to late twenties so i expected her to be a little tech savy compare to the other old teachers thier. I go in asks her whats going on, so we will call the teacher Ms.E 

Me : hey how's it goin, is everything okay 
Ms.E : i have a class in 5 minutes and I can't teach them because i am unable to use the smart board with my mac 

Me : let me take a look 

* I proceed to run a test on the smart board and its working now i go take a look at her mac to see whats goin on turns out she didn't plugged in the hdmi cable, so I plug it in and it works *

Me : there u go all good

749,"""You have negative energy""","Hello all, 

Once again I am back with another story, this one took place earlier today. 

Before we begin I want to preface that I have a very tired sounding voice, this voice has gotten me in trouble a few times before but it really is my natural voice. This issue is compounded with the fact that the headsets we use make even the most chipper voices sound a bit harsher. That's really it for the background though, let's commence with the story.

This day started like any other Monday, not great but nothing out of the ordinary. This user happens to call in close to 11, and the call goes something like this;

>Me: Hello, thank you for contacting the \[insert company name here\] help desk, I'm EonThief how can I help you?  
>  
>User: Yes, I reset my password and am having issues receiving emails now.  
>  
>Me: Yeah I can definitely help you with that, can I have your IP address?  
>  
>User: My what?  
>  
>Me: \**Slower this time*\* Can I have your IP address?

Now I didn't think much when I repeated the question, after the headsets we use are kinda trash and users do have a hard time hearing us sometimes. This user on the other hand took it very personally.

>User: Excuse me sir you don't need to be so negative with me.  
>  
>Me: \**very confused*\* I'm sorry?  
>  
>User: You have this negative energy surrounding you for some reason, and I don't enjoy it.  
>  
>Me: Again sir, I am sorry however this is just my normal voice.  
>  
>User: No sir I don't believe you, you just have a very negative energy. It's very frustrating, especially when I've been pleasant with you.  
>  
>Me: Sir, I can assure you this really is just how my voice is.  
>  
>User: No sir, you are just very negative. I don't understand why you're so pissed off?  
>  
>Me: I promise you I'm not mad or annoyed, this is just how I talk normally.

We proceeded to go back and forth for about 5 minutes before I was able to get the information from him, meanwhile my coworkers are listening in on my call trying not to laugh to hard because this guy won't stop fighting me. 

The call ended fairly uneventfully, and the worst/best part is had the user not fought me, I would've wrapped up his issue in a minute or two.

It's a very short story, but I figured someone else might be able to get a laugh out of it at least.",84,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF69AA60>
750,"Hello, IT. Have you tried turning it on?","Going to keep this short, since I’m posting on mobile.

A few weeks back, I (non-IT) got a call from the supervisor of a neighboring department. Now, I’ve spent some time working in that department when they’re short-handed, so I have a good rapport with that supervisor.

“Help! I can’t print X that we really need right now. Can you please print it?”

“Ok, sure.” Print X, walk it over, notice in passing that they’re very busy. Well, I’m kinda busy too, so I just chalk it up to difficulties with computer or something and go back to my work.


#One Hour Later
My supervisor walks up to me and asks me to go over to that same neighboring department.    “They’re having trouble with this specific printer they need to print X (from earlier). Can you help them fix it?”

So, back I go. Their supervisor is very happy to see me, and says:    “The printer isn’t working. I’ve tried everything I can think of. I even checked the cords to make sure it was plugged in properly.”

The printer has a distinctive light on the front, that is currently off. I glance at it, note the missing light, and think for a second (this supervisor is pretty good about not giving me bad information). Pull the printer away from the tangle of cables behind it, turn it, find the small, unmarked, round black button, press it, hear the gratifying sound of printer turning on. Watch it spit out three copies of X from earlier.

Neighboring supervisor: “I feel stupid now.”

Me: “Don’t. Even knowing exactly where the power button was, I still had to look for it, and this printer is never supposed to be turned off. I’m pretty sure someone just pushed the printer back into this tangle of cords and something pushed the power button.”

##Note
Before anyone blames the user on this one, I’ve been there two and a half years and have never seen that printer turned off before. I knew about it because I’m responsible for making sure the identical printer in our department stays working/stocked, so I turn ours off sometimes when I’m refilling it. And the button really is hidden and unmarked.",37,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF69AAC0>

752,6 Degrees of Separated Paper,"This post was written instead of doing actual things. Apologies for the crappy title but no apologies for lack of Llamas in the story.

Once upon a time, Toshiba made a very nice dot matrix printer called the P351. 24 - count 'em - 24 pins of punchy tungsten points that enabled a huge variety of visual beauty on the printed page but was mainly just used for underlining some times. There was a colour capable version too -  the P351C but as this was the era of CGA and EGA video no one in the offices knew what colours were yet and proceeded to just wear out the black section of the ribbon.

The P351 was the pride of any office it graced for producing correspondence. And it had accessories too. The favourite one was the Automatic Sheet Feeder for loading A4 paper when a job was sent. and loading a second sheet for the second page. I won't overwhelm you with the technical detail of what occurs when a third page is sent for printing from the document. 

In these golden days of 1990 or 91, one particular P351 resplendent with ASF was matched with a fully functioning 286 with Wordperfect 5.1 which for you youngsters out there was a Word Processor. Not one of these new fangled Desktop Publishing rigs with WYSIWIG functions but, rather, a column on the left that showed how many lines of text would be sent to the printer. 66 Lines of text on your screen lined up with 66 lines of printed text on the paper.  Line 67 would be the top line of the second page.

Now we get to the tech support part. On this occasion, the customer reported the fault that a single page document would, on occasion, print the last line of a page (e.g. Line 66) as a single line at the top of a second page. I won't bore you with how long it took to see the fault let alone how long it took to test suffice to say it was a painful process. And it didn't happen if you just created your own document with 1 - 66 listed down the page. Ohhhh no, it had to be an actual letter full of words, line spaces and carriage returns slowly and noisily delivered to the A4 sheet of paper.

You are probably thinking ""well its obviously the automatic sheet feeder"" and so did I until the replacement ASF did the same thing. 

""Probably paper dust on the sensors"" you counter. There was not a spec in that device when I finished servicing and cleaning it. Even used the multimeter on the Paper Out switch to make sure it was seeing open/close reliably. Guess what? It was. The paper-out switch was mounted in a way so that a length of thin steel poked through a window and was pushed by the paper surface when present to close the switch via a lever action. ""Well that lever is bent"" you say to which I say it wasn't and also ask you stop interrupting.

Ideally the lever/thin pokey steel piece meets the surface of the paper perpendicular. There is only one screw mount so its possible for the whole switch to pivot on the screw and be at something other than a right angle. But it pokes through a window so the angle is restricted by the presence of the edge of the hole. By being on an angle, even a slight one, changes the distance ever so slightly of the end of the lever so the lower edge of the paper is being detected fractionally before it would if the lever was perpendicular. ""Adjust the switch so its straight, next story"" you rudely interject.

That's half of the story. Keep reading this one. This customer had just received 150 reams of letter head paper from a cheaper overseas supplier. A4 paper is 297 mm tall (or 11 3/4"") . This new paper was both inconsistently milled/cut for the length but also had tiny variations in the edge too so it was not perfectly straight. The printer was in spec but the paper was not.

The extra page with a single line of text did still happen but not as often as it did before the switch was aligned. And loc-tite was required to make sure it didn't move. But the issue remained as long as they continued using that paper.",54,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF69AB80>
753,"I did nothing, it just stopped working","I am sorry, english is not my first language.

A few Years ago, there was a time I had faith in my costumers....This is the story how I lost it:

We are heaving the following situation:

I was installing a new  VoIP IPBX software with new telefones for a costumer. It was my first IPBX at the time and I have read a lot of manuals etc. before installing it, none of them prepared me for the actual installation but this is another story. After finishing it I got on vacation for 3 Weeks and was in a good mood on a monday morning when I recieved a call. 

A employee of this company was on the line and she told me that her telefone is not working. ""I did nothing, it just stopped working"". I tried fixing it remotely because this costumer is 1 hour of driving away. But I can't.

I tried reprovisioning the Phone, Changing IP-Adresses, searching for random Messages from the MAC-Adress of this Phone in the network but...after 2 hours, 1 hotline call,  2 calls to friends of mine and nearly my hole company trying to fix the problem I needed to drive to the company.

So, I am ariving at this company and got the error in about 5 seconds. The error was the following:

Two employees got the great Idea to switch their workplace..and in consequence, their phones. One of them took the phone and the powersupply of this phone, the other don't. Instead, the employee searched for a powersupply and found one, which was...because why not...the powersupply of the old phone. As I was looking at the new phone I saw, that the employee took the powersupply and connected it to the Headphone-Jack (Which is clearly market btw.) of the new phone...So the new phone was fried. The other employee took the existing powersupply pluged in the phone, recognizes that it is working, and then pluged the PoE-Adapter to the phone... Costumers fault.

I talked to these two, explained what happened and dumped the telefones it in the trash. 

The story could end here, but there was an aftermatch.

You know, I am having a moral compass. I wrote an Invoice, but I hadn't mentioned the Employees or the original Problem. I don't want to harm anyone.

After the Boss of this company got my invoice I got a message telling that he won't pay for that, because it was clearly my fault. Apparentelly he spoke with the two employees and they told him that it was my fault and the telefones weren't working in the first place.

A few messages with my Boss and a group-call with the Costumer later, my Boss decided that I won't work for this costumer in the future.

A Week ago I got a Mail from the costumer. He apologized for the event and told me that everything else is working.",25,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF69ABE0>

Okay and now could I get you to take the mouse and look on the bottom-side of it for anything that may look as though the USB dongle was placed into a slot to be held during shipment? It may be pressed into the bottom of the mouse length-wise or width-wise.

&#x200B;

'Yeah I don't see anything like th -- wait is this is right here? Has it been here the whole time?!? and I have 2 other combos sitting here for a week and it's been there the whole time? Why didn't the other two people tell me to check there!'

I'm not sure ma'am but if it was indeed there and you can confirm it is there on the other 2 combo sets as well I can get you two return labels sent to your printer to be sent back to us.

'Please do, and maybe next time they would make the user aware that the USB dongle is inserted into the bottom of the mouse?'

I'll mark that down as feedback for your previous incidents, is there anything else I can help you with today?

'No that was everything, thanks.'

No problem, have a good day, bye.

Completely perfect display of all-around failure, from the end-user not having the ability to process that by the 3rd package they maybe should investigate the items and see if the dongle somehow is placed within them instead of assuming that the SEALED MERCHANDISE PACKAGE YOU WERE SENT WAS MISSING A USB DONGLE - ALL - 3 - TIMES?

And then onto the fact that I share work with co-workers who don't know to check those places for USB dongles on wireless devices...and would rather set the lady up for additional shipments..

755,The Ghost Mouse,"
Some years ago, while working in a cube farm for a call center type tech support company, one of my colleagues hangs up his phone and stands up in his cube. Typically, when someone stood up in the cube farm, it meant they had one of those ""you won't believe this"" kinds of calls.  So, he had the floor. Fighting back laughter, he told the tale of the Ghost Mouse.

He had just taken a call from a customer in the company we serviced. The customer noted that he believed that there was a virus of some type on his computer, and it was affecting his mouse.  The mouse would, from time to time, at seemingly random times, make a move on its own and click on something on the guy's desktop, or even click and hit ""sleep"" on the start menu, causing the guy's computer to shut itself down. When it wasn't doing that, the pointer would just randomly twitch.  Really weird behavior.

The tech went through the usual procedure, with the client noting that this had been happening off and on for the past year or so, and had only recently gotten worse.  At first, the client thought their mouse was bad, and got it replaced with another wired mouse. This fixed the issue for a few months, before it started cropping up again. So the customer asked for another mouse. The local team checked it out, and found it worked fine on their test computer, and the problem didn't replicate itself while the local team was on site, so they just chalked it up to a user error. 

So, the customer just suffered with it. At first, it wasn't happening often enough to be a problem, so he just lived with the issue.  That was up to a few weeks prior. Now things had escalated, and the computer was being shut off by the mouse.  Naturally IT wasn't happy he'd let things go this long, but far as anyone could tell, it wasn't malicious. Just annoying.  So the customer called the local team, and the local team conferenced in the outside support (my colleague) to help trouble shoot things and figure out what the heck was going on.

It was during his wall to box (start at the wall and work your way out, we all know this tactic) inspection that the answer was found.

While checking the back of the tower, plugged into one of the USB slots there was a tiny USB dongle. The kind you use with a wireless mouse.  Unplugging that dongle stopped the problem. Where the dongle had come from was actually answered by the customer. The desk hadn't originally been his. In fact, the person that had originally sat at that desk had moved up to another floor, leaving the desk empty. When they moved, they must have forgotten their dongle, and were just using their mouse with a replacement dongle. Originally, the company had occupied something like five floors, so at the start this old user was just far enough away so that every so often the stars would align, and for a moment the bluetooth would connect to the old dongle, and make the first customer's mouse move.  The old customer would only see this as a lag, and didn't think much of it.  It was only after the company had consolidated down to two floors, that the problem got worse. Now, the two customers were only a few cubicles apart, and one floor in difference. This was enough that the mouse was getting confused and sometimes would link up with the old dongle, and sometimes link up with the replacement. 

When the local team talked to the guy with the replacement dongle, he stated that he'd just filed a ticket because his mouse wasn't always responding. Cleared up two service calls with that one.

We would often laugh about this story, imagining the frustration on both parities parts; while also seriously questioning why, in the whole time the guy had been having this problem, no one on the local side ever bothered to check the back of the computer.",22,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF69ACA0>
756,"What the hell is a ""line square"" ?","We've all had that one user who says something simple in a weird, convoluted way... 

This one is mine, and he's a doozy.

&#x200B;

""I used to have my icons pinned to squares on my screen, but I logged in today and they're all gone.""

I tried to help him pin applications to the taskbar, thinking he meant that. He didn't.

Tried to help him pin them to start menu, but he seemed genuinely surprised that the start menu existed...

&#x200B;

Finally he gave me the clue that I needed: ""I used to have a line square in the middle of the screen and a regular line on the left."" 

&#x200B;

...

&#x200B;

Just kidding I had no idea what that meant. 

&#x200B;

I eventually dragged a desktop icon to the middle of the desktop and he exclaimed ""yeah! like that!""

&#x200B;

What he wanted was to drag some of his desktop icons to the middle of the desktop, and arrange them in a square. That way the apps he uses regularly are separated from the apps that have shortcuts on the desktop but that he doesn't use...

&#x200B;

The ""regular line on the left"" are the unused apps, not enough for a second column, in a vertical line of icons on the left side of the desktop.

&#x200B;

There's 6 apps he uses regularly, so it's not a square. It's a rectangle. Or as he likes to put it: 

""A line square""",151,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF69AD00>
757,"How do I get to ""Webcam Lens""?","Fairly short one but amusing nonetheless. This isn't the first time this has happened but it's definitely the most extreme example. I work in IT for a university and I can't even fathom how some of these people are supposed to be considered ""educated"".

In recent months, our new Annual PC Replacement program has gone full-swing, replacing any computers on campus older than 6 years. Primarily we've been pushing Latitude 5511 setups with docking stations. Although it's fairly common now, most laptops 6 or more years ago didn't have a physical shutter that can be used to block your webcam.

A ticket came in yesterday titled ""My Video is Not Working For Zoom Meetings"" and before I even opened it I was fairly sure I knew what the problem was going to be. So I directed her to the settings menu in Zoom and said ""Is the preview showing a gray screen, a black screen, or is it giving you an error message? Because those are 3 distinctly different issues."". Because gray would indicate it's not detecting a webcam, black would be the shutter issue, and an error would be, I dunno, a driver or something. She confirmed that it was showing a black screen.

I explained that the PHYSICAL slider to the left of her webcam needed to be opened. She could not locate any sort of slider. So I sent a picture of a 5511 with the slider circled in red and said ""It looks like a round black switch just to the left of the webcam lens as seen in the attached picture.""

...

User: ""waydeultima, I still have a black screen and no video. How do I get to web cam lens? I am on my laptop and I can get to the camera settings but it does not look like that.""

Me: ""... Go ahead and bring your laptop by our office when you get a chance.""

*Ring,Ring   Ring, Ring   Ring, Ring*

Me:  Hello?

EIM:  I have an emergency incident.  First-line has reviewed the case and would like you to join a call.  Can I add you?

Me: Sure, give me a minute to get online and add me to the mtg.

*Joins Meeting*

UBB:  We want a bare metal restore (BMR) on 4 servers.  We have 6 hours before our business day begins and these are mission-critical.  

*Users know what they want.  They don't always know what they need.*

Me:  What's the problem?

UBB:  Automated patching completely destroyed the Get-Money-From-The-Customer application!

Me: Completely destroyed?  Wow, that's rare.  And you had no problems with the patching in QA?

EIM:  Looks like patching QA was successful last week, no incidents were reported. 

UBB: *Blah Blah Blah*  

*""Completely Destroyed""* meant *""The App won't start, and the support team works business hours"".* I try to talk them into a rollback to the point before patching started.  After much pounding on the table by the non-technical UBB members, I give in.  First-line does a BMR.  Need I mention that the business wants to keep the call going, ""Just in Case""?

5 hours later, BMR is complete, last full backup and incremental backups are applied.  The business owner pronounces the App healthy.

UBB (the service owner, to point the finger):  **Excellent, still one hour until business begins.  We've got time to patch!**  *<click>, hits the button for self-service patching.*

I mute my phone and begin swearing...

20 - 30 minutes later, all 4 servers and patched and back online.  No problems.  Guess it wasn't the automated patching after all.

**If you think patching screwed up your servers, why would you restore them and then patch them?**

Bonus: Two of the servers turned out to be DEV.  Under our ground rules, the division pays less for DEV support, but can't raise emergency tickets against it.

Bonus #2:  App team thinks an app config file was corrupted on one DEV server and one PROD server.  The other two were fine, as far as they can tell.",31,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF69ADC0>

760,sometimes simple solutions are the best,"Long, long, ago, in galaxy far, far, away.

I worked for computer company as a field tech and tier 1 support for customers by phone if needed.

My company had sold a system to a smallish college in a medium sized city in a neighboring state.  I had never been to this site, I didn't even know it existed.   This system was a small System V Unix type running on a small Motorola RISC system (at least I think that's what it was).  A handful of dumb terminals and printers were connected with RS-232 serial connections and system backups were done on a QIC-60 external SCSI tape drive.  

Problem was, their backups were failing.  I forget the exact error, I think there was a script that called cpio and dumped to the tape device.  Anyway, the support guys had sent out a replacement tape drive and the customer was reporting the same problem, so they asked me to go onsite and see if I could fix it.   

I figured I could either fly or drive, drive would be about 5 hours.  Flying would take longer since there were no direct flights, I had to fly PAST the city to the nearest hub, then fly back.   No thanks, I'd drive.

So, I called the customer, got directions, scheduled the trip, and drove out the next day.  It was fairly late by the time I got there but I knew I was spending the night anyway, so I had them show what happened.  Yes, they would stick a tape in the drive, kick off the script, and more than half the time it would fail.  They had tried different tapes, all the stuff the help desk had asked them to try.  The folks at the site were getting read to go home but I could stay since the door would lock behind me when I left (back in those innocent days).

I played around with different tapes for a while trying to see if there was a common thread to the failures, but couldn't find one.  Sometimes a tape would fail on the first try, and work on if I tried again.  The original tape drive was still there so I tried it and got similar results.    They had different brands of tapes I could try, but it didn't make a difference.  I was really scratching my head.

However, I'd been doing this type of work for a while.  In my college days I had worked in a stereo/electronics shop doing repairs and sales.  I was remembering that sometimes folks would have trouble with an audio cassette you would fast forward it, then rewind it, and it would play normally.   Same thing could happen on VCRs.   

I had never worked with a QIC-60 device before and I was not very familiar with Unix at this time, but there was a manual with the system so I found the section on tape device commands, and there was, a tape command with a retension option.  I have forgotten the actual syntax over the years, but I tried it out on the one of the problem tapes, and the backup script ran fine.  Tried a couple of more tapes, and they all worked.  So, I just edited the script to add the retension step, gave it one more test (which worked!), and headed off to dinner.

I told the help desk folks what I'd found and they added the step to the script they supplied to other sites.  This was one of the first customer to have this particular hardware and apparently they had not seen this before.",27,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF69AE80>

Many conversations are written as best I can remember them from my notes and memories about the incidents they describe, but the heart of what you are about to read is as true as I can make it.

[Episode 7](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/pnl4ib/the_new_guy_chronicles_episode_7_what_is_your_job/)

The cast:

Jordan - FNG

Thomas - Me, the manager and network admin

John - The older of my two other reports, primarily responsible for server maintenance, major application upgrades, and supporting our smaller off-site locations and their specific applications

Daniel - The younger of my two original employees, though here for the same amount of time as John. Both longer than me, actually. Desktop and server support, document management and phone system support, phenomenal people skills.

**DAY 83**

I walk by Jordan's desk and look at what he's doing.  YouTube again.  That's fine.  I've sent him a lot of educational mater- wait why does that say scambaiting?  This is not the first time I've seen such content on his screen as I've passed by his desk.  *The shot changes to a close-up as black letterboxes close in around my narrowed eyes, camera panning slowly to the side.  My eyes widen suddenly as the camera abruptly changes to a close-up from another angle*  Why am I suddenly in an anime?!  The world may never know.  Owabi itashimasu.  

**DAY 87** - Watching YouT - er - ""Training Videos""

In case you've missed it in the last few episodes, Jordan lacks both knowledge and capacity.  John, Daniel, and I have all attempted to impart knowledge to Jordan, but we can't spend our entire days teaching him the most basic things.  To assist in this process, I have lovingly curated lists of videos and courses available for free on YouTube (lacking any paid service at the time) and have sent him days worth of material to watch in his downtime.  Courses on basic networking, problem-solving, Active Directory basics, etc.  I assumed I had sent him enough material to keep him busy for a while.  Apparently I was mistaken.  

Time and time again over the past month or so I have passed by his desk and seen the same things.  Scambaiting, Kitboga, Scammer Payback.  I decide to poke him with hints again to see if he starts digging holes once more.

(Note: The body of the emails you see here is copied verbatim.)

FROM: thomas[at]cursedorg[dot]hell

TO: jordan[at]cursedorg[dot]hell

SUBJECT: Videos

BODY: Jordan, I'd like you to send me an email by the end of the day summarizing what you’ve learned from training videos over the last two weeks or so.

-------------------------

FROM: jordan[at]cursedorg[dot]hell

TO: thomas[at]cursedorg[dot]hell

SUBJECT: RE: Videos

BODY: They’ve all been about different types of scams that people try to use: things like spyware, fake javascript popups telling you to call this number, ransomware, and so on.

-------------------------

FROM: thomas[at]cursedorg[dot]hell

TO: jordan[at]cursedorg[dot]hell

SUBJECT: RE: RE: Videos

BODY:  Can you give me some examples of how you think you will be able to practically apply that knowledge in your position on help desk?

-------------------------

FROM: jordan[at]cursedorg[dot]hell

TO: thomas[at]cursedorg[dot]hell

SUBJECT: RE: RE: RE: Videos

BODY: Not from a help desk/customer service perspective but from an IT perspective yes. If someone calls saying they’re from Microsoft saying they detected an error with our system, or a popup appears that isn’t caught by [anti-virus], or an email that looks suspicious is sent to me, I’ll recognize it for what it is and report/delete it.

-------------------------

FROM: thomas[at]cursedorg[dot]hell

TO: jordan[at]cursedorg[dot]hell

SUBJECT: RE: RE: RE: RE: Videos

BODY:  Based on your experience with IT so far in our environment and these videos, do you feel you could adequately train a user to recognize one of these scams if we put together short training sessions?  Say 15-30 minutes?

-------------------------

FROM: jordan[at]cursedorg[dot]hell

TO: thomas[at]cursedorg[dot]hell

SUBJECT: RE: RE: RE: RE: RE: Videos

BODY: I think so. I do think I could get users to recognize some common tactics scammers use, but I’d be a little nervous teaching it to others. I’ll do it if I have to though.

-------------------------

FROM: thomas[at]cursedorg[dot]hell

TO: jordan[at]cursedorg[dot]hell

SUBJECT: RE: RE: RE: RE: RE: RE: Videos

BODY:  Don't worry about having to train people; I'm not going to have you do that. I ask because it seems that every time I've seen you at your desk you're watching these videos, for probably the last month or so. 

I'm just curious if you think the amount of time you've spent on this particular subject is proportionate to the amount it will come up in your day-to-day work, especially since you are fairly confident you could train someone to recognize one of these scams in only a few minutes.

-------------------------

The responses ceased here.  I gave him some time to think, then called him into my office for another of the chats that I'm becoming *so very* fond of.

Thomas: ""It seems like, for the past couple weeks at the least, every time I pass your desk you're watching these scambaiting videos.  Would you say that's been the bulk of what you've been watching lately?""

Jordan: ""Yeah, mostly.""

Thomas: ""How much do you think you've watched a day?""

Jordan: ""I couldn't really say.  I don't know for sure.""

Thomas: *giving him a bit of an out because I know it's far more* ""Would you say an hour and a half a day is a fair estimate?""

Jordan: *taking the bait* ""That probably sounds about right.""

Thomas: ""So, about seven and a half hours a week?  Almost a full day a week for the last month?""

Jordan: ""...""

Thomas: ""I'm just asking because earlier you said you thought you could adequately teach people how to look out for tech support-style scams in about 15-30 minutes.  Given that you could do that, do you think that spending 30 plus hours over the last month watching these videos is an appropriate use of your time?""

Jordan: ""It might have been a bit excessive.""

Thomas: ""I'll find you some more material to watch that will be more applicable to your duties here.""

Jordan: ""OK.  Thanks.""

Thomas: *screaming inside*

762,Power troubleshooter,"After working in some various jobs (shipping agent, sales, admin, translations...), but always being the person everyone asked for help to fix their computer, I gave up and decided to make that my job description.  I enrolled in an evening class at the university and got a job working at the internal IT help desk at a big telco. 

The people who called in were employees, all over the country. This was the mid 90's, and this telco was the main provider of telephone and internet access in the country, especially once you got out of the big cities. They had offices and stores of various sizes all over the country.

A lady called from one of the small stores in a town out in the boondocks. Her computer wouldn't turn on - she pressed the power button, and nothing happened. No light went on, no beep, no hard drive or fan noise - nothing. This was one of the computers which had a socket in the power supply that you connected the monitor to, and normally the little light on the monitor would come on as soon as you pressed the computer power button. But nothing happened here - obviously the power supply was completely broken.

I was about to send the ticket on to the nearest tech center for a site visit, which would mean a couple of hours' drive for somebody, when I got an idea.

""Before I send the tech out, let me ask you something. Do you have a desk light by any chance?""

She did.

""Is it working?""

It was.

""If you unplug the computer, and you plug the desk lamp into that power outlet, does the desk lamp still work?""

It did **not**.

""Great! You'll have to get a splitter if you want to use both the desk lamp and the computer. And call the janitor about the bad outlet.""

764,You can not use the old desktops. Use the new ones.,"My workplace had been replacing 2014 era desktop computers with ""new"" ones.

The old desktops' specifications:

- i3 or i5 Haswell

- 8 GB RAM

- SSD

The ""new"" desktops:

- i3 Kaby Lake (2017-era CPU)

- 4 GB RAM (Removable media is banned at that workplace, so I can't use USB sticks for the ""ReadyBoost"".)

- HDD

The company also uses security products where they use more than 0.5 GB RAM and half of the HDD's disk I/O. For anyone that used Windows 10 on a HDD, you can imagine exactly how those computers run.

The new desktops often took about half an hour for them to be usable enough to load a web browser, Excel and Outlook. The old desktops only took a few minutes for the boot process, logging in, and loading those applications.

One day the new desktop was stuck loading for over an hour, and that included a restart about 15 minutes into the first loading when it displayed a black screen. I told the IT department about it and they told me to just keep waiting. They were definitely not interested in investigating the problem. I dumped that computer somewhere else and brought back the ""decommissioned"" old desktop.

Fast forward a few weeks later and IT had switched out my old desktop with the new one. And I had an email instructing me not use a decommissioned desktop again. Of course I printed out that email.

When the new desktop was stuck loading for over an hour again, I decided to just browse the internet on my phone and find other things to do, while letting IT know every half an hour or so about it being stuck loading. Every time they told me to just keep waiting. My supervisor and manager (both who had also been angry with the new computers) left me alone when I explained the instructions from IT.

Record time was about 3 hours. I pulled up task manager at the 1 hour mark. It took about 20 minutes for the lock screen to appear and another 20 minutes for task manager to finish loading. It showed the disk I/O usage was at 100%, the RAM usage was at about 95% usage, high number of compressed memory, and the CPU sitting at about 30% usage.

Even my somewhat IT-illiterate manager said ""what a pile of s***"".

The bad news is that most of the old desktops were already thrown away. The good news is that the IT department is potentially getting funds to buy new desktops, in the next fiscal quarter. No idea what the hardware specs will be though. They're still going to stick with the security products though.

But hey, why worry about ransomware when the security products make the slow computers too slow to run the malware? Good luck trying to encrypt or exfiltrate the files when the OS and the security products are trashing the HDD.",364,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF69B040>
765,Why didn't you tell me that?,"I work as phone tech support. I got a CX who had some network based issue, and various other issues, most of which I wasn't able to figure out because her answer to all of my probing questions was ""it doesn't work"" and some whining. It took me a couple minutes of increasingly verbose questions just to establish the phone was still turning on. So a fun one. 

I establish after some more questions her phone is not on wifi and get her to tap on the network. It prompts for a password. This spawns a discussion of her insisting that it doesn't have a password and that she never typed in a password and that no one set up her phone and typed it in, etc. Eventually I convince her to go downstairs and read the side of her router. 

She gets downstairs, and immediately insists there's no password. I get her to read it off and suddenly there's a password that she starts reading off to me. I advise her I don't need to know it and just type it into the phone. She then tells me she left the phone upstairs for some reason and was annoyed I didn't tell her to bring the phone with her to the router. 

(Side note I was previously given a dissatisfied survey by another customer for giving overly precise instructions)

After she goes back upstairs to get the phone and type it in, it doesn't take the password. The customer winds up hanging up on me because she had convinced herself that the phone manufacturer (my company) had broken her phone because she had looked up the the new line of models last night.

""Well I can understand where you're coming from with that unfortunate timing, but if you just get the Wi-Fi password we can get your phone back to normal""

767,Word to the unwise,"I'm old enough that when I was in school, the term ""IT"" didn't really exist. DOS did exist, but Windows was barely windowed. Most places ran their stuff on mainframes, and having a PC at home was uncommon. 

Still, no matter what my actual job title was at a given place of employment, I always fell into the role of ""Speaker to Tech"". For a few years in the mid 90's, I worked as a translator of non-fiction, mostly manuals of every product under the sun. One of my  clients was the Chamber of Commerce; they helped smaller companies get access to foreign markets so they had a list of translators they'd send documents to for translation. I got a small job at first so they could see how I did.

When I came to deliver the document - Internet wasn't exactly ubiquitous at the time, so hand delivery was common - I chatted a while with my contact there, and mentioned my habit of fixing people's computers. She immediately pounced. ""We've got this one PC that makes funny noises when we boot it, and then stuff doesn't work properly. It started after one of the guys tried to fix {some issue that I can't remember}, but he never got it to work. I've asked a tech but the helpdesk didn't have any idea and they take ages to send a tech out. If you're not in a hurry, maybe you could look at it?"" I wasn't so I did.

She booted the thing, which, yes made various funny noises. Think an 80's TV game -beep boop boppity beep boop. It was supposed to start Windows, but all it showed was a DOS prompt. I could start Windows by typing the full path though, so that was something - the machine wasn't entirely trashed. 

Once there, I started Word, since that was the program she really needed the computer for. It worked, so that was good. My client would be able to use the computer until the tech made time for her. Still, I really wanted to know what had made it misbehave. On these old boxes, the first thing you do is look at autoexec.bat, so I opened that file in Notepad.

It was full of garbage.

More specifically, it was full of information about fonts, templates, and other stuff that Word puts into Word files.

Yep. The guy who'd tried to help with whatever the issue was had also known to start with autoexec.bat. Only he hadn't opened it in Notepad - he'd used Word. And then he'd saved the file as a Word file.

All I needed to do was open the file in Word again and ask Word to save it as a pure text file.

And that is how I ended up on the list of favoured translators and got a lot more work from the Chamber of Commerce.",48,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF69B160>
768,Dead Powerbook and the nervous professor,"Sometimes in tech support you can look like a hero without really doing anything difficult.

Years ago when I worked at a University we had a lot of professors get excited about Apple Powerbooks.  They liked the look, the metal case, the Unix-y feel of OSX, it was so \*cool\*.  And we bought a bunch of them.   And as super smart users tend to do, they didn't think much about backups.  We had no kind of Enterprise network solution, we told them to buy an external disk and use Timemachine.  Or rsync from the laptop to our fancy file server.  I investigated Retrospect but no one wanted to pay for it.

And then one day Professor C came hustling into my office with an old Powerbook.  

C:  ""This laptop is dead and it has some important files on it.  Can you help?""

Me:  ""Maybe, what's wrong?""

C:  ""The screen never comes on, I don't know its powering up.   I tried a different power adapter but the screen is still blank""

Me:  ""Did you try an external monitor?""

C: ""Oh.  No, I didn't think of that""

For some context, C was a computer guy, but he was more in theory end of things, he could probably do his job with a pencil and notebook.   So, I hook up a monitor, nothing.  Power LED is on so it seems to be not totally dead.   Connect an external keyboard and mouse just to see if that makes any difference.   

Me:   ""I think you're right, its dead Jim.  Do you have any backups?""

C looks kind of nervous.  Like there's something he doesn't want to tell me, but figures he's going to have to.

C:  ""Actually, this my OLD laptop, my wife's been using it for her business and its got all her important files on it.   And she doesn't have any backups"".

OK, so this is interesting.   Its certainly not proper for me to use my time to recover his wife's files.   But C is a nice guy and I can see he's sweating bullets.   I sure would not want to tell my wife her business files are gone.  I'm about to tell him he'll have to take it to a repair place to get the drive pulled out, maybe the data can be recovered from there.   But then I have another thought.

Me:  ""Do you have your current laptop with you?""

C: ""Yes"".  Pulls a newer Powerbook out of his backpack.

I grab a firewire cable and connect the two laptops.  I explain to C about ""target mode"" for Apple computers.  I boot up the broken laptop in target mode and his good laptop sees it.

Me:  ""You can copy files to your laptop from the bad one.   And get your wife to buy an external drive to make backups on"".  

To myself I'm thinking, and get her her buy a reliable computer for ""her business""!  For crying out loud, using this old POS was just asking for trouble.

C was super grateful.  He thanked me over and over again.   He couldn't believe I had this secret way to access his dead laptop (it was pretty silly, I just used a utility that the Apple guys had included, its not like I invented anything).

The strangest thing was I had another professor in a different department have the exact same situation come up a week later.  He was another super cool guy and he was just in next building over, so I just strolled across with my Firewire cable and got to be a hero all over again.",30,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF69B1C0>
769,"Please text link to my phone, not my email (on my phone)","Not a support ticket item, but worthy of a post I believe.

TLDR; Salesperson wanted link to video texted to her, not emailed, so it can be on her phone.  She asked for a text by sending an email from her phone.

We have a customer, let's call him Mr. X, who is very important to our organization.  He's one of our biggest customers and loves us on top of that.  A real win-win customer.  For his 50th birthday, Sales thought it would be a cool idea for employees to submit individual Happy Birthday! videos to the customer.  I thought it was a cool, neat idea as well.

The process was to create the video and send it to the Salesperson.  They will then compile all the videos and send to Mr. X on his birthday.  I made my video, did a few edits then sent the Salesperson an email with the link to my video.  

I then received an email back from the salesperson asking me to text her the link so that she could have it on her phone.  The eyebrow-raising part was that her email asking me to text her the link so she could have it on her phone said ""Sent from my iPhone"" at the bottom.

Perplexed, I responded, ""The link is in my email and will work on your phone.""

She responded back ""Everyone has been texting me their videos.  I need it texted to me so that it can be on my phone......  Sent from my iPhone.""

I blinked a few times, grabbed my phone, went to my original email, copied and pasted the link then texted her the link.  

She promptly responded with a ""thank you! \*smiley face emoji""",91,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF69B220>
770,"""Yes, hello. My phone stinks.""","I work the helldesk of the german government, which means we get calls from both the offices of the MPs and people working in the administration.

Today was a very quiet day, as are all days before the storm that is election day. The phone rings. A lady from the adminsitration.

Me: ""Helldesk, Chakkoty here. How can I help you?""

Lady: ""Yes, hello. This is \[REDACTED\] of the \[REDACTED\] department. I have a very strange problem...my phone stinks.""

Me: \*reliving the guy-who-blinks-in-disbelief-meme\* ""...I'm sorry what?""

Lady: ""Yes, the receiver of my phone stinks. Unpleasent smell. It's a rather old device.""

I blink several more times, wondering wether her predecessor had particularly bad breath. I return to tired professionalism and record the incident, adding the details to send it to the phone people.

Me: ""I sent a ticket so they'll switch it for a new one.""

Lady: ""Thanks! Have a good day.""

As I ended the call and saved the ticket, I got up and told my colleagues.

They laughed, one in disbelief. Another suggested the phone people would send someone to smell-test the device.

I added that they might want to bring a dosimeter, considering the age of some of the devices still in use here.


What a fun day.

EDIT: TIL that there are, apparently, a great many ways for a phone to stink. Most of them completely unrelated to the device itself.

771,There's no KB article on how to help you commit tax fraud.,"Hey folks, it's me - I work in the petrol industry doing the tech support/administration of payment systems, point of sale, back office servers, etc.  
**Prior Stories**:  
[The Screams From The Server Closet](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/oa3lx1/the_screams_from_the_server_closet/)  
[And that's how you invalidate your service agreement!](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/p4qaqf/and_thats_how_you_invalidate_your_service/)  
[How to invalidate your service contract in two easy steps, the sequel.](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/pk0phy/how_to_invalidate_your_service_contract_in_two/)  

We begin this story with me stumbling in about 15 minutes late, and when I unlock my PC some software update fuckery had taken place and my usual suite of programs took extra long to come up, so I was already irate by the time I jumped into the queue and got my first call.

**Ring Ring Ring - Tax Fraud Phone**  
It's a station in Texas, and this is their second call to us today, so I run through getting their information and pull up the previous case. All the previous caller did was walk them through accessing the tax rate setting in their configuration client UI. I open the feed on the case and assign it to myself, starting to write out an addendum to it, since the caller is yammering about ""tax rates being wrong."" Here's what the caller relayed to me:

> ""The tax rate is 7.8, and it has to be 7.8 by state law and uh.. it should have.. was the whole time! For months! But the report from last month is wrong, it shows a tax rate of 8.3! I need the report fixed. My accountant says we'll get in trouble!""

Now I'm woefully under-caffeinated yet, and I'm chewing my way through a Lara Bar between responses to him, but my brain catches it and goes: ""Wait, you're asking me to edit a report you sent to your accountant for tax purposes?"" So I ask him that, verbatim, my chipper and pleasant customer service voice shifting into a low ""Bro, you trying to implicate me in tax fraud?"" tone. He catches the tone shift and his entire demeanor goes onto the defensive.

> ""What? NO NO, I'D NEVER ASK YOU HOW TO EDIT A REPORT! I just.. you know.. do you know who changed it or how it changed? Because we didn't, it was /always/ 7.8%!""

""Then why did you call twenty minutes ago and speak to my teammate Dan asking how to change the tax rate?""  My voice is now not even blunt, it's accusatory, this man is trying to get us both in some real deal shit. He makes up a wholly fantastical story about how he needed to confirm what it was, because he didn't know. Except that we both know he already knew it, because of the report he asked me to doctor. My hand is fully over my face and I'm groaning into the microphone at this point.

Instead of disengaging, he keeps changing the question slightly, now he just wants to know if I can see 'when it was changed', and when I say ""You just called asking how to change it, probably then?"" he accuses me of trying to accuse him, so I actually accuse him: ""Look man, it looks like you're trying to get me to help you commit tax fraud. I can't help you with this."" At this point I'm 80% sure he's going to try and escalate to my boss, but he asks again if I can verify when it was last changed. I put him on hold and send two messages:

First one goes to my support rep asking if there's a way to pull a log of changes for when the tax rate was changed, just to like... verify? He doesn't want to do it.

Second is to /u/callmesado - my coworker and one of the guys who helped train me:  
> Me:  So.. if a site is trying to draw me into their attempted tax fraud, is it okay if I report them anonymously to their state, or will I get fired? :f  
Him: i 100% wouldnt  
Me: Ugh.

I get back with the site and tell them I can't confirm when it was changed, but I think something clicked with them because the guy is like ""OH OKAY HAHAHA, MAYBE MY BOSS CHANGED IT, BYE!""

He gets off the phone quick, and I sit here, staring at an empty coffee cup, yet to be filled.",186,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF69B2E0>
772,"The ""borrowed"" mouse that won't work","So i was off work one day... our department runs 7 days a week.

I get copied on this support ticket out of sheer hilarity... I thought it was a prank until I got back to work and heard that J DID in fact have issues with his mouse.

&#x200B;

So with me being out J calls in a support ticket, his mouse isn't working. The mouse that he borrowed from me because it was my day off and my mouse is a lot better than his mouse.

&#x200B;

""Try turning your computer off and back on again""

""didn't work""

""is your mouse wired or not wired?""

""wired""

""It's plugged in""

&#x200B;

""OK I flagged your workstation as out of service, it will be *90-120* minutes until we can send a tech down""

The tech finally gets down and looks at Js Workstation.

&#x200B;

""THIS mouse isn't working?... isn't it for this other computer?"" 

&#x200B;

""Dunnachius said I could borrow his mouse when he was off""

&#x200B;

""Yeah but... it's still plugged into that other computer... this mouse that's still plugged in to your computer is working just fine""

&#x200B;

And yeah... that's one of the support tickets that they couldn't fix with zoom.

&#x200B;

TLDR.. J borrows my mouse and never changes what it's plugged into, then puts in a support ticket because it won't work.",38,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF69B340>
773,high risk,"so i came up on my primary duty alone for the first time. i'd had a four hour training session with my boss.  he was an excellent trainer, i had a ton of confidence in him. so as i prepared the thruster for this vibration test, i realized i could not find the three mil-spec bolts.

 i needed to bind the $750,000 100 pound thrust apogee rocket engine to the magnesium mount i had already bound to the vibration machine (think giant pissed off bass driver) with dozens of quarter-inch bolts.

  the thing about this 100 pound thruster that weighs about ten pounds, if it works as sold, customer would earn $15 billion via their big fat com sattelite over the next 15 years.  i'm looking at 15 billion dollars, and the folks that hired me for this task have a perfect flight record. no in flight failure, ever. they built 100 pound engines for Apollo, 25 pound and 900 pound for Shuttle, hundreds of Geostationary engines.  

they are the very best.  and now i had to call boss and ask about the three bolts i could not find.  took me 5 different job applications across 20 years, three in the last year, to earn this job. i had found a way to work with my heroes. now i expected to be fired.  my job was to protect the thruster from the many dangers of vibration testing. i failed step one.  boss was tight and true, never heard him shout, always calm and cool and magnificent in his leadership.

775,Almost fits...,"The story of ""But it fits"" reminded me of one I experienced.


Many moons ago I worked copy/print and we had a large format color printer.  A big HP inkjet that could print on 36"" wide rolls of paper.  This printer took 4 ink cartridges, CMYK and it had two different ink systems.  One for regular ink, great for printing on paper and UV ink, great for banners and such that'd be exposed to the sun.  The ink cartridges were big, about 10"" long, 1.5"" wide and 5"" tall.  On the back of each cartridge was two metal and rubber ports where they would plug into the feed lines to the print heads. Most importantly they were keyed at the bottom, each color and type had a different plastic notch.  To swap ink systems you had to open the back of the machine up, flip some latches and the entire ink system from cartridge slots to print head holder came out.  You can see where this is going already.

While I was on vacation two of the guys I worked with decided to swap out one ink set for another.  I can't recall why, it's well over a decade ago.  When the cartridges didn't fit they forced them in.  This of course meant the two ports didn't line up properly, plastic was snapped and the machine apparently leaked a good amount of ink out of it.  So the Help Desk was engaged, it's determined that the part is broken and a new one will be sent out at the location's cost.  Everything is agreed upon by management.  This all happens before I return from vacation.

Here's where it becomes MY tech support issue.  I get back, I'm told why the machine is broken and what is being done to repair it.    So I keep an eye on things, waiting for the tech to show up or for the machine to be fixed when I come in one day.  A few weeks go by, each week I contact our Help Desk who looks up our ticket, sees that they've contacted HP and says they'll follow up. Now my manager is getting upset because we're turning away work or sending it out to another location so we're losing a cut of the money.  I call the Help Desk again and get the ""We'll follow up."" answer again.  I relay the info to the manager, who then emails the District Manager (the DM had been in the loop since week 2) and the Regional Manager.

The next day I get a call from HP, they apologize for the delay.  Something went wrong on their end and they lost the order or something like that.  As they've now blown past the SLA for the repair they're sending a tech out tonight.  The tech is going to go to the airport to pick up a replacement part and drive to our location to install it.  I can't remember what the SLA was but I know our service was weekdays, normal business hours.  I believe to make up for the error they also dropped the charges for the repair and replacement parts.

Sure enough about an hour later I get a call from a tech verifying that we'd be around to let him in.  I let him know we're a 24/7 business, someone will be here for him.  He showed up around 7pm with the box for the replacement ink system and some parts.  He had come up from Orange County (we were in Los Angeles) and he proceeded to take our machine apart, clean up the mess inside, replace the broken parts and install the new ink system.",34,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF69B460>
776,What OU is the local admin account in?,"First time post, a short one.

TLDR: System engineer called tech support to ask what OU the local admin account was in.

Details:

A couple of months ago, one of our classrooms was repurposed as a lounge (Instructors/Sailors needed a place to relax), and all the computers were removed. Fast forward two months, and the instructors realized the remaining classrooms were insufficient for all the training ongoing, so all the computers need to go back.

Thankfully, my boss supported me when I indicated that the tech support office shouldn't be involved with the effort, since the repurposed classroom was never contractually our problem (US military contracts are odd beasts), so the In-Service Engineering Office was detailed to put the classroom back together. 

We never shut off the switch ports for the room, so this should be easy, right? Right... A couple of the machines wouldn't come back on the network, because one of the engineers didn't bother to read the labels on the hard drives and ensure the workstations were put back together with the correct drives. (EDIT: I wrote this on the fly and credited StickyMAC as the culprit preventing network access. In fact it would have been that a hard drive swap was too significant a hardware change, prompting MS Active Directory (AD) to drop the workstation from the domain.)

Senior engineer drops by to tell me they can't get a couple of the systems on the network. I ask if he logged on to check connectivity, etc. He responds that he can't log on, so he can't check connectivity. 

Me: With local admin? 

Engineer: I don't know the local logon.

Me: Local admin is <redacted>, password should be <redacted>

Engineer: Okay, I'll try that.

::10 minutes pass:: The phone rings

Engineer: What is the OU of the <redacted> account?

::facepalm::

The pay for this well.. Bit show? Is remarkably good.

We are under tents and set up on folding tables. Screw you covid for forcing us outdoors.

I help a few people get logged on and help folks get setup, diagnose an unplugged power strip ect. Wow what do you know I have time to go get a coffee.

&#x200B;

8:00 am rolls around and the first angry customers shows up to get their recalled balloon checks.

&#x200B;

I get the first Irate customer at my desk and I start to work on his TPS report.

&#x200B;

""Can i get some help I can't upload my TPS report"" Q asks everyone. I know it's intended to be asking me for help. To put some of this in context Q is somewhere in age between my dad who retired 5 years ago and my long dead grandfather in age.

&#x200B;

""I'm filling out Mr. Smith's TPS report, pass the customer over to someone else and give me 5 minutes and i'll come help""

&#x200B;

So I finish Mr. Smith's TPS report and get up to look at Qs computer. I hit the giant link on his desktop for the web app to import TPS reports and... no joy... no internet. I look at his network and.. no network connection.

&#x200B;

Le joy...

I go into it and... no wireless networks available.

?

&#x200B;

So the next thing I do is start looking for the idiot switch for switching off the wifi, i've seen that issue before, heck i've done that more times than I can count and it's an honest mistake.

&#x200B;

Yeah this ancient crapbox doesn't seem to have an idiot switch. I go into device manager to look for a wireless card driver issue....

&#x200B;

AND... no wireless devices... period.. none zip nada.

I push out a quick email to the boss. ""Hey Boss... Qs computer won't work out here without a wifi dongle""

""You've spent enough time trying to get qs uploader to work, just get back to work and let tech support *Team view* his computer""

&#x200B;

""Oh..Kay?""

&#x200B;

So I call next in line in the Socially distanced bull pen of a queue of POed customers and start taking down his information for the party balloon warranty and start filling in the TPS report.

&#x200B;

After about *half an hour* of tech support trying to help Q get teamviewer working he finally gets the all clear to go into the building with the computer to walk to IT and get them to look at the computer.

&#x200B;

About 10 minutes later Q comes back and sits down with his computer. He plugs in a wifi dongle and starts his laptop up. He takes the next angry customer in line and gets to work... surprisingly everything runs well for about an hour.

&#x200B;

The supervisor walks up and says ""What the heck are you doing Q, no USB storage allowed for any reason, these computers have sensitive balloon warranty information on them"" and she pulls the wifi dongle out.

""I'm just using what IT told me to use to fix it?"" Q tells her.

""IT knows the rules, IT made the rules.. this is a serious breach""

I decide to open a giant can of worms and remind the supervisor of a certain policy..

""Don't you have to have him escorted to cybersec and HR on a first offense due to the sensitive nature of the customer data on the TPS reports?"" (who knew that party balloon warranties were so sensitive of documents?)

779,bigboss and the almost new laptop,"I had an earlier post about $bigboss and email.   I have a few stories about this person, not all are strictly technical so I'm not sure if the fall within the thread moderator rules.  This one is, I'm pretty sure.

At this point $bigboss had rotated out of the Dept Chairperson role, but was still on the faculty and recognized as a ""high maintenance"" user.  He would rarely submit tickets, he'd either email me directly, call me, or show up in my office wanting help NOW.  This time, he emailed.

Basically he said his laptop was running slow and he was worried something was wrong with it.  Could I come by and look?

We didn't actually care about ticket metrics at this point, a lot of requests were generated in a similar way it was mostly ok.   I replied that I'd be happy to look, when would a good time be?  He was in his office right now so . . .  I popped down the hall to see him.

He had his laptop, a Powerbook, sitting on his desk, and starts showing me, at warp speed, what the problem is.  He's clicking his mouse every two seconds flipping from window to window, app to app, and saying ""see?  see?  its slow!   There is some lag while he indulging in this clicking frenzy, the screen is refreshing so fast I can't follow what he's doing.   

I take a deep breathe, can I try a few things?  He lets go of the mouse and I start slowly clicking through all the things he has open.  There's a ton.  Several browser windows, Office, text window, pdf viewer, and then I hit something I've never seen before, its a window with a bunch of graphs that seems to be constantly refreshing, like its streaming.   What's this?  Its a program that shows him real time stock pricing info, he uses it for day trading.  

I start looking at the resources being used using the regular old system monitor stuff from Apple.  The machine has the minimal memory offered and he's using it all.  I'm guessing there's some swapping going on as he feverishly clicks around.  Plus this streaming is a memory hog according to the monitor.  When did this slowness start, last week.  By chance is that when he installed the streaming price thing?  No, wait, yes, er, maybe?  

I explain he probably needs to upgrade memory but it may be easier to just get a new laptop.  I know for a fact that he has lots of funding from various grants, but he is also VERY cheap.   He says the laptop isn't that old, he shouldn't have to replace it.  How old is it?  A year, maybe two.  I'm looking at it and thinking no way.  I click on the ""About this Mac"" tab, its over 4 years old.   He doesn't believe it.  I'm telling him I could look it up the property database and find out when it was purchased but that's beside the point, doesn't he want a faster machine?  We should order one with the memory maxed out.  Yes, I'll be happy to get him a quote. 

I get him a quote and we go back and forth about much it costs.   We buy a lot of Apple stuff they should give us a better price.   They already do, it called Education pricing, and no, our Department is way too small of a customer to get better pricing.  He's kind of sulky but finally agrees to what I've proposed.   For context, most users would send me a completed config for a laptop and I would just get it ordered.  

Anyway, I got his new laptop and install all the stuff he wanted, bunch of stuff from macports, and migrated his various files (yes, most users could do this themselves).   And he had to install his magic stock pricing thing since was clearly not related to University business.  

At the end of day it was kind of frustrating since the original problem was caused by his ""incidental use"", and all the angst about buying a new laptop when he had plenty of money to buy one and he used it a zillion hours a day.   But I realized that if the University wanted to pay me to listen to folks whine about how expensive computers are, that's OK, it was clear my time was considered ""free"".",20,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF69B5E0>
780,Unresolvable resolution,"This post was written while sitting in a relaxed pose at the desk so apologies for typos, jargon and lack of reference to llamas.

We look after several customers and a few of them are on VMWare Horizon and using virtual desktops. One of these lost a staff member and borrowed one from another division for half a day a week to help out. I shall name this borrowed staff member ""Pandora"". The staff member who left shall not be named as they are irrelevant to the story.  So that's the sitch - Friday morning till midday , Pandora goes to the other desk, logs on as the other user (its a generic login anyway) on the physical PC and then logs on to the VM.

Cue the phone call to us as , horror of horrors, the ""text for the pictures has changed"" and Pandora wants to make sure she has not been hacked.

To be clear, the text has not changed - the *size* of the text has changed. Before you reach for the Wireshark and router logs or even check under her keyboard for the post note with faded password to determine the source of the hack, the Friday morning PC has a 19"" monitor. Still at 1920x1080 but 19 imperial inches. On Thursday night, she left a 23"" monitor.

Kudos to her, she can see the difference in icon size between a 19"" and 23"" screen but cannot see that one is a larger screen. The IT version of cannot see the forest for the trees - cannot see the bezel for the pixels or something. That needs work. Ignore that attempt at metaphor, its silly.

We get through the explanation and the call is done. At midday, Pandora goes to lunch and returns to her regular desk on her regular desktop and regular login on her regular VM. Cue the call that the (join with me here intuitive readers) ""text for the pictures has changed"" , but now they have gone large! Probably 15% larger or there about.

Please note, this is not a story bagging the woman for calling up on 2 occasions - this is every Friday. There are other calls that will be recieved form Pandora during the week, but those two on Friday are clockwork.

The division where Pandora helps has just hired a new person to sit at that desk so Pandora does not need to go there on Fridays now. Its quite possible that there will be new frustrating calls from the new person but at least I will not have to give geometry lessons every Friday any more.",12,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF69B640>
781,Nothing works,"I’m going to assume tech support can include help for Broadband/Phone services.

So I have far too many of this type of event happen to not have it kept anonymous…sometimes it’s a daily event.

Anyway, I work for a UK Telecomms company (we come fix your phone and/or broadband services). Generally speaking we’re the last resort after you’ve spent upwards of an hour with an Indian call centre (or the Yorkshire one). 

This particular lady lives in the South Welsh valleys. I receive the appointment info and ring ahead to inform her I’m on the way.
When I ask what’s the nature of the problem, hoping for a couple of symptoms to narrow it down to ‘Broadband’ or ‘WiFi’ fault, she responds “it doesn’t work”.
No, she can’t be anymore specific and she’ll show me in 30mins.

She’s had to go through various checks to get an appt, let alone an engineer through the door, due to covid restrictions on ‘total loss of service’. I run a quick SMS based test which reports back that all is OK. 🤷🏻‍♂️

I’m on site, her “it stopped 4 days ago, it doesn’t work”.
Me “What doesn’t work???”
Her “Netflix, it doesn’t work on the TV” as she tries to hand me the remote.

My internal monologue runs somewhere along the lines of “Are you kidding me! We’re in a pandemic, I have to wear gloves and a mask and wipe down everything I touch and you can’t get Netflix working?!",27,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF69B6A0>
782,Please increase my mailbox size to 1 Exabyte ...,"Just had a funny support ticket yesterday.

Normal users get a mailbox size of 500 MiB. For normal usage that's enough. You're not supposed to abuse the mail system as *""archiving""* solution - we have a separate product for that.

But thanks to the current pandemic it can happen that some users might get a lot more mail traffic than others and might thus run out of space pretty fast (e.g. because of attachments and what not). So if that happens a user can open a ticket and request more space, e.g. 1 GiB or 2 GiB if need be which we will happily provide.

And then yesterday we get this ticket from a user who thinks she's particularly entitled to having a super duper large mailbox. :-)

***""Please increase my mailbox size to 1 Exabyte!""***

So we call her back, thinking that maybe that's just a typo and she actually meant *1 Gigabyte* ...

***""NO!! I really mean 1 Exabyte!!""***   she insists :))

***""I need all the mailbox space you can give me!! I am sooo tired of constantly running out of space ...""***

*""Constantly""* ???  Ticket history shows that she's only had her mailbox size increased once so far: from 500 MiB to 800 MiB. And that was like 1 year ago. Storage analysis shows she's got like 750 MiB in her mailbox now. So given the growth rate of her mailbox over the past year 1 GiB should do just fine for her. If she runs out of that space too she can request 2 GiB in about a year or so ...

(BTW, fellow sysadmins:  BS like this is *exactly* why you don't do zip and anything at all unless there's a ticket ID for it!!!  Document everything and make sure it's in the ticket !!)

***""NOOOO!!!   I want 1 Exabyte ...!!""***

Of course I refuse. There's no way in this Universe I could give her that much space!! :)

***""I am going to escalate to your manager!!!!!""***  she screams.

I can hear my manager's phone ringing. He picks up and the only thing I can hear is ***""LOL WUUUUUT!??  :)  ""***

That phone call didn't even last 30 seconds. My manager walks to my desk laughing ear to ear and tears in his eyes:  ***""Yeah. Right. Just give her 1 GiB and then close the ticket. And don't forget to print it out and put a frame on it. That ticket needs to be in our hall of fame ...""***

Some users... Tssskk tsssk tssk.   1 Exabyte of mailbox storage for Outlook.  Riiiiiight. :)",420,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF69B700>

                                     - a story in several parts - 

		 
- - - - -

So, when I was writing this, I was  a few hundred miles out to sea in the Gulf of Mexico, typing this up on a Powerbook G4 (1.67GHz, 17"") running Mac OS Tiger and listening to Sting and Swing Out Sister. It took a day for me to get my sea legs (and conquer the cognitive dissonance that a vehicle this large could move this smoothly on the waves and yet seem like it's not moving at all - inertia is _weird_), but I seem to have adapted to this well, and it's done wonders for my being able to get things down on paper.

But I digress.

When last we left off, our erstwhile hero was about to hop into a meeting with $HR_DALEK and $COCKWOMBLE. We rejoin our regularly scheduled program already in progress...

- - - - - 

The appointed time had come, and after tapping a few times on my phone's screen, I turned it off, and knocked on $HR_DALEK's door, trepidation apparent in my actions (though not visible on my face).

""Come in!"" the reply came, saccharine at the absolute best, and I entered. Sure enough, $HR_DALEK (a hire with experience from the bad old union-busting days at GM) was at his desk, and $COCKWOMBLE was there, a Topo Chico in his hand as he slouched back in the chair in front of $HR_DALEK's desk. I slipped my phone out of my breast pocket and dropped it, face-up and screen-off, on his desk, then sat down at a roughly 120-degree angle from each of them.

""So, Jack, the purpose of this meeting is to figure out what's going on with you and why you're so persistent about this.""

""$HR_DALEK, that's not entirely it. I'm curious as to what's happened with my annual review, as well as my well-deserved merit raise. As you know, it's been six weeks since the start of the year, and given previous history, I expected this to have hit already. Last year, I understand the delay - $PREVIOUS_HELPDESK_MANAGER had his midlife crisis and went off to farm goats or something, but let's be blunt. You're saying that this year is going to be better, and yet reviews haven't happened yet. What's going on?""

He looked uncomfortable and shifted around a bit, but regained himself very quickly. ""Well, there's a few things that are going on. First off, we understand the contributions that you've made to the company, and we appreciate them. However, at present, we're not in a place where we can extend any financial benefits like merit raises or even cost of living raises.""

""I'm failing to see how that's the case. I've singlehandedly saved you almost a hundred thousand dollars in Austin alone. I know Dallas has rolled out the exact same setup I have - and you know how I know this? _I GAVE THEM THE DISK IMAGE OF THE IMAGING VIRTUAL MACHINE AND SET IT UP ON THEIR HYPERVISOR!_ So, at the very least, you're saving about $200,000 in Texas alone based off an initial investment of forty hours of my - ridiculously - underpaid time. If you expand that out to West Covina, Eau Claire, and Atlanta, we're _easily_ talking over a million a year, and that's assuming you're paying tier 1s at each location as pitifully as you're paying the ones here.""

""I agree that you're underpaid, and while I can't fix that right now, I want to commit to getting that sorted out for you - ""

""So let's talk time frames, then.""

""We can talk about that later.""

""No, we're going to do this now. It took six weeks to even get a meeting with you to get this far, so I don't have any faith in your 'open door' policy.""

He squirmed a bit, and $COCKWOMBLE was smirking. ""Well, privately, because I trust you, I can tell you this. Company-wide, we're holding everyone's reviews until June. This is to allow everyone to standardize on a time and do raises properly across the board. It also means that if $HOLDING_COMPANY has a bad year, and says that we can't do raises, no one gets them early, and no one is left out. You understand that, right?""

I think that at that point my rage broke a little.

""I understand that you're not willing to pay me commensurate with the skill level I exhibit with the duties I perform for the company. I also understand that you're not willing to remediate that in any timely fashion. I _also_ understand that new hires at my level are getting hired on at my current rate of pay, despite my seniority and skillset, and that what I do for the company is exponentially more beneficial to the point that I should be working on our internal systems team instead of dealing with end users.""

""Well, Jack - ""

""Well nothing,"" I said, leaning forward. ""Let's cut through all the BS here and be straightforward. I've been counting on this raise so I can start doing two things - cutting back the late-night on-call shifts in order to have a better work-life balance - and not draw wife aggro for working fifty-plus hour weeks every week - and using the raise to help save for a down payment on a house. If you're saying that I'm not going to get that, despite all I've done, we have a serious problem.""

He leaned back a bit. ""Well, here's a possible solution to at least one of those things. Are you part of our 401K program?""

I nodded, having a horrible idea where this was going, and yet preparing for the trainwreck all the same.

""If you're saving for a house, you know you can borrow for the down payment from your 401K, right? You probably don't have that much in there, so it'd be easy to repay.""

$COCKWOMBLE was smiling widely at this point, and I was _done._

""Did you just have the unmitigated _gall_ to suggest that I take a taxed penalty to make up for your inadequacy and shortcomings?"" I exploded like an IBS sufferer who had been force-fed nothing but Taco Bell, sesame seeds, and chunky chili for the past few days, then given a triple dose of Miralax.

""Wait a minute, Jack - "" he said, turning to me.

**_""I DIDN'T SAY YOU COULD TALK YET.""_** I started channelling my best Addaioth (the all-consuming wrath) and apparently started putting off a disconcerting aura. ""Not only would I take a taxable penalty on that, I lose what I have vested. You just started offering it last year, and a 3% employer match with five years for full vesting is absolutely ridiculous. I would eat entirely too much if I did that, and it would basically be a way for you to shirk paying me what I'm worth.""

""Every employee will get their review in June when it comes around company-wide - "" 

""And how do we know it's going to come around in June?""

""That's when our HRIS changeover is completed, and it'll - ""

At this point, $COCKWOMBLE was smug as hell, and $HR_DALEK was relaxed and smirking.

""See, you say that,"" I said, rolling my eyes. ""Are you going to prorate the raise in June for the delay, since at that point it will be 18 months since I got a review and raise - and how about back pay?""

""No, there won't be back pay, but we'll prorate,"" $HR_DALEK said.

_'And like that you've lost me,'_ I thought to myself. ""So in essence, you're going to give me a raise and a half, but I have to wait until June, and there's no guarantee of anything in the meantime.""

""I hate saying it like that, Jack, but that is in essence what's going to happen,"" $COCKWOMBLE said, sipping at his Topo Chico. ""We can't do anything about it at this level. $PARENT_COMPANY is going to have to authorize anything, since we're going under a wage freeze until then.""

""Then either you or I are going to have some discussions with the beancounters over there,"" I groused.

""Look, Jack, the idea that your employer is going to take care of you while you work for them is an older mode of employment that's not really thought of any more in the modern age of 'jump three years to upgrade your salary' and all that.""

""And if I'd wanted to do that, I've had the opportunity twice over in the seven years I've been here.""

""$PREVIOUS_OWNER had a very old style of management that served this place well when it was small, but we're trying to be a larger company now, and it doesn't work.""

""And I see we're not getting anywhere here,"" I sighed. ""I'm not going to lie, I'm _very_ disappointed here. This is a very hard pill to swallow, and when you announce it to the employees at the next all-hands, they're going to be _incredibly_ disgruntled.""

""Again, this was for your ears only,"" $COCKWOMBLE said, glancing at $HR_DALEK.

""You know my memory,"" I said, picking up my phone and dropping it in my breast pocket as I walked out. ""I'm lucky if I can remember breakfast.""

_Fortunately,_ I thought, walking outside, _I don't have to remember._

785,"What ""Browse"" button? I don't see a ""Browse"" button!","A long long time ago, back when Windows 95 was new and current, I worked the help desk at a local computer retailer.

I'd regularly get calls from people who couldn't figure out how to install drivers or whatnot, and I'd walk them through it on the phone.

One day, I got a call from a guy who needed to install drivers for a new card he'd just bought. I don't recall what, exactly, I think a video card.

The computer has booted up and it wants a driver. The dialogue box automatically comes up. I tell him to click the ""Browse"" button in the bottom right corner of the box. He insists there's no ""Browse"" button.

I at first figure that he must be at a different stage of things, and so I'm racking my memory for what the various stages of these dialogue boxes look like, and asking him to verify. Each one is a no.

I explicitly describe the dialogue box that I expect to him - everything matches up, except ""there's no Browse button!""

Finally I give up and tell him that he'll need to bring it in and pay us our service fee of $50 to install drivers for you.

Suddenly, he says ""oh, you mean *this* Browse button?""

*facepalm*

788,Clueless Manager,"A few years ago now we had a new manager start in the Sales department. I will call her Tracey. She'd been in post a few weeks when we get a request from her for some new software. This was very specialised CRM software (these were the days when CRM was the latest buzz word on the block). It cost a fortune, had questionable reviews and above all, looking at the sales blurb, needed several weeks of expensive training before you could use it. Anyway, I took the request to my manager who agreed with me that this was not a good fit with our organisation, so he called Tracey and tried to talk her out of it. She refused to listen and demanded that we purchase it as it was ""vital to the continuing health of the company"" . We were still very reticent but she said she would bear the cost out of her own budget so we reluctantly agreed. 

Fast forward a few weeks, the package arrives on several DVDs. I read the installation instructions and immediately realise that it's going to take a whole day to install this piece of crap. I call her to arrange a time to do it, warning her that it will probably take all day. She says she's too busy and it will have to be done out of hours. I inform my manager and he tells her OK but she must pay the overtime out of her budget. She agrees to this so I go in on a Saturday and install the software. It was. B***h! Anybody remember installing Novell NetWare from a bunch of floppies? Well it was like that. I finally got it all done and running, but couldn't test it as I have said it needed a training course. So I closed it down and went home.

Monday morning comes, I go up to seel her and tell her it's installed. I was quite interested in seeing exactly what she was going to use it for. So I clicked on the icon and the opening page came up. He first words to me were ""Great! Now show me what it does and how I use it""

I was flabbergasted! She'd spent all this money on some software that she'd read about in a magazine somewhere then gave the impression she was an ""expert"". 

The result was the software was never used as she'd blown her budget buying it and couldn't afford the training courses. She left a few months later.",134,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF69B940>
789,Can you fix the Excel sheet?,"This happened right before the pandemic started when I was Tech II on helpdesk.  I work for a fairly large hotel/casino, and we have hundreds of employees who ""do not use computers for their jobs"" but also have to use computers every day during their hours at work.  And a lot of them are not, eh, tech savvy, in the least.

For example the table games dealers, who at the end of their shifts use a shared computer that is secured behind the cage to enter their tips, which tells them how much they get to take home, how much is owed in tax from it, and how much they have to put into the shared dealer tip pot.  They accomplish this nifty feat with... The Excel Sheet™.

One day I'm out on the floor as the only tech on duty (Tech II? More like Tech I-IV) and the cell phone rings.  I answer, and a kindly sounding man who barely spoke English informed me slowly that The Excel Sheet™ was wrong.  ""It's wrong?""  ""Not putting the right numbers"" he says.  ""Okay, I'll come take a look.""

Now of course it is an I.T. problem and the I.T. department supports such common desktop software and I'm even moderately proficient with Excel however there is one problem, and that is that the I.T. department, at least the helpdesk, has no access whatsoever to these files which are both financial and gaming board related, and I had never seen this particular document before in my life.

On Arrival:  I can see the PC behind the access controlled door, however I see nobody near it.  I shrug, dismiss my security escort, and head back to the office. Time spent: 5 min.

Five Minutes Laytairrr:  Desk phone rings.  It's the cage.  This time another gentleman, far less gruntled than the first, asks why I.T. hasn't fixed The Excel Sheet™ yet.  ""Ah, when I showed up there was nobody there."" ""Yeah well I'm here now.""  ""Okay, if you can tell me the asset number on the white sticker on the computer I can remote in and take a look right now."" He gives me the number and I tell him to click yes when he sees the prompt and then I'll take over control of the computer. He asks me if he has to stay on the phone because he has to go and he's already late.  I tell him I can take it from there.  We hang up, and the madness begins.

The 2013 5400RPM i3 ProDesk creaked to life as it was asked to do the first thing other than Excel calculations since the Windows 10 upgrade. Display black.... Boink, it loads. Aha, an Excel sheet.  It's complex, a mess (I later came to learn that some smart guy in the games department made it many years ago and they've just been making copy after copy ever since).  In the few seconds I had before chaos struck, I couldn't really even discern definite input cells or output cells, however several had errors or were something akin to $1.0822294e12.  I click on a cell and am deciphering the formula to trace back what the hell is going on when suddenly a delete key is struck and the cell vanishes. **100** enters a ghost.

I furiously CTRL-Z and try to click out but now the ghost hand is moving the mouse!  Between our movements averaged a random cell, the ghost hand clicks! Another number being randomly entered!  The ghost takes over again at which point I stop fighting and am watching in awe.  The ghost selects what I'm pretty sure to be an output cell, due to it containing a rather long and complex formula, and astonishingly just pounds over it with **62** and presses enter.  Several cells go red, errors pop up all over the page.  I can no longer watch, this situation is beyond hope.

With a powerful thrust I force control of the mouse up and out of the shadow session and pound the X, and then I just sat there for a moment staring at my desktop pondering on what I had just witnessed. The sheer lack of concern, the data violence, the awesome power of having no fucking idea what you're doing or what is even going on and pounding away anyway.  I didn't even have time to call down and yell ""Stop! Stop! Please stop, it's already dead!""

I wrote a brief and relatively kind ticket up under the name of the games manager that evening that suggested they work with games admin to replace that copy, as there was nothing I.T. could do to unfuck that pig, and also strongly advised at least basic Excel training for their dealers, even if all it was was having a dealer more proficient do it with them a few times.  Time spent: 30 minutes for the small part of me that died inside.

In the end, I'm not mad, I'm not traumatized, it was like seeing something so much bigger than you that it was kind of humbling.

791,It is NOT a password issue!,"It's been a little bit since my last post, but I really gotta say I love my job security. Only two players here, just Me and User. (Background: I work for an MSM, doing outsourced Help Desk for various companies. For most of my clients, I provide Tier 1 support. Anything outside what our SLA states gets escalated to that user's company's Tier 2)

User: Um, hi, I'm having trouble with \[software\]. I was on the VPN, got kicked out, logged back in, and now I can't access the application. Can you help me?

Me: Certainly. It sounds like it could be a network password issue. \[check AD, password just changed 2 weeks ago\] I see you just changed your password recently. Did you happen to use winter, spring, summer, fall, autumn, password, or welcome in your password?

User: I used ""fall"", but it let me back into the system, so \[software\] should still be letting me in. I need you to get me into \[software\].

Me: I understand, however, ""fall"" is a blacklisted password \[goes into spiel about why it's blacklisted--top 7 words in English according to Google and Microsoft, yadda yadda yadda\]. Usually around the 2-3 week mark, the server does an assessment of sorts and when it catches a blacklisted password, it starts kicking you out of the VPN and any other network app. It will--

User: But I'm still in the network! Just please, get me back into \[software\].

Me: Okay, but without a password reset, I'll have to escalate you to Tier 2 so they can poke around and see what else might be happening. However, since you were booted from the VPN, that tells me it's a password issue. 

User: It is NOT a password issue...

\[Repeat this password 3 more times, with her refusing to change her password because she's currently in the network, and also refusing to be escalated.\]

Me: Okay, so let me put it this way: today, you get booted from the network but it lets you back in temporarily. Without a password change, you're going to have your account locked by the server on a weekly basis for the next few weeks. After that time, the server will not permit you access to the network. 

User: Fine! \[doubtful tone of voice but lets me know she's just humoring me\] Let's go ahead and change my password. But I'm telling you it's not going to work...

\[I guide her through changing the password. She tries to login to that software immediately without waiting for my instructions to sync her machine to the network.\]

User: See! I told you--

Me: \[ignoring her interrption\] Okay, so the password is changed. Now you need to lock your computer, then unlock it using your new password. \[Software\] should let you in after that. 

User: \[grumbles\] Fine. I'll try it one more ti--hey! It worked! I'm in. Thanks. Bye! \[click\]

Conversation: 24 minutes long. 

I kid you not, twenty minutes later, her *husband* calls in with a very similar issue. He also had recently changed his network password, and was only locked out of his account. I explained the issue, he was totally cool about changing his password, and he had no issue logging in after that.

792,"Karen has a ""critical"" printer issue but won't let me fix it","Been lurking a while but never posted. Hope y'all enjoy.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: I can't stand 'Karens' and printers. 'Karen' at work has a critical report she needs to print but ghosts me for over a week when I try to fix it, then proceeds to get mad when it isn't fixed.

&#x200B;

I have this 'Karen' at work who I typically hear from once a week about an issue that is critical in her mind but then won't let me fix it or will ghost me when I try to reach out.

&#x200B;

Most recently, she called complaining her printer was printing out gibberish and needed it fixed ASAP since she has to print out \[insert critical report here\] every morning.

&#x200B;

Karen: My printer is broken and needs fixed ASAP because I have this \[insert critical report here\] I need to print every morning.

Me: Hi Karen, what exactly is the printer doing?

Karen: It's just printing out a bunch of gibberish and symbols when I need it to print this \[insert critical report here\].

Me: Alright, have you tried restarting the printer and possibly restarting the computer?

Karen: Yes, yes I've already done that and don't have time to do it again. I'm very busy and I need this report ASAP!

Me: Alright, well it's very possible we'll need to reinstall the driver for the printer. It sounds like it's corrupted.

Karen: I don't have time for you to do that right now because I'm very busy. (we end the call)

&#x200B;

So I decide to email her because I'm a nice guy and ask her to let me know when she goes to lunch so I can walk down there and reinstall the printer driver and not be in her way (you know, because she's SO busy all the time). I also found out she had an older printer driver that had a known issue so felt pretty confident in this fix.

&#x200B;

Well she never even responds to me. A week goes by and I decide to close the ticket unresolved since it doesn't seem to be an issue for her (after all, she has to print \[insert critical report here\] EVERY morning). Literally as soon as I close it she emails me and is complaining about the printer because she hasn't been able to print \[insert critical report here\] in over a week and wants to know what the hell IT is doing. So I tell her once again I need to reinstall the driver for the printer and she needs to let me know when I can do it and that I've tried explaining this already. She responds telling me she can make time in her ""busy"" day right now...turns out she's going on vacation tomorrow and is the only reason she ""has time"" for me now.

&#x200B;

I reinstall the printer driver and all is good. Not a thank you from Karen but I truly don't give a shit...hell I'm just glad she's out all next week. BTW I work for a small company in a small town (I don't live here though) where everyone knows everyone and most of these people have been working here for years - I'm only a few months in...basically getting help desk experience and certs then probably going to peace out.",45,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF69BAC0>
793,"email, ethics? but I want that message back","This story was sparked by various email and compliance posts recently seen.

In my previous job as a sysadmin at a public University I had an interesting event with an email message.   In this job my direct supervisor was a faculty member,  above him was the Department Chairperson.   The Chairperson, we'll call them $bigboss, was not a real nuts and bolts computer person, more of a mathematician.   $bigboss was very smart, but also had a some rather fanciful expectations and I could write a dozen posts easily on crazy stuff I was asked to do.  We had a two person support team and $bigboss probably generated 20% of our projects.

Anyway, I'm in my office one day, working on something, no fires burning, all is well, and $bigboss come hustling in.

$bigboss:  ""I need some help right away""

$bigboss is looking kind of nervous, he's shifting from foot to foot, looking around, acting kind of guilty.

me: ""sure, what I can do for you""

$bigboss:  ""I sent an email and copied someone by mistake, I want you stop the message from getting to that person""

me:  ""if the person is not on our local system its too late, its already gone""

I'm thinking wow, this has some serious ethical implication, I've never dealt with this type of thing.  But this is $bigboss, so I kind of have to do what they want.

$bigboss:  ""no it went to $professor and it shouldn't have""

We used an mbox type system, so I knew the message would be basically a text file, I'm wondering if I can just delete it or edit it?  Will that mess things up?  I'm not really an expert on the MTA we used.  Plus there's the whole ethics question.   Who's message is it now?  Is it $bigboss's or $professors?  Right now its just some bits on our mail server.   But $bigboss is standing over me RIGHT NOW, wringing his hands and looking at me expectantly.

I log into the mailserver and start paging though the logs.  I explain that the logs don't show the message content but when did he send the message, who was it too besides $professor, I need that information to find the entry.  $bigboss give me the info and I find the log entry.  I'm paging a back and forth in the log and then see that $professor had accessed and ""read"" mail AFTER $bigboss's message was delivered.  So now the message is in $professor's mail folder.

me:  ""your message got delivered but $professor has now copied it into their mail folders.   I don't know they have actually read it, but I don't feel comfortable going into their files without their permission""

We had a ""rules of sysadmin conduct"" understanding that we did not look at folks home directories unless the data was obviously public, like web pages, or we had permission, or we were investigating possible misconduct and had sign off from the University legal team and/or data security team.

$bigboss just stood there for a few seconds.  They knew I was doing the correct thing and could not really order me to try and drill down and kill this message.  $bigboss kind of looked into the distance, sighed, thanked me and left.    I don't know what $bigboss ended up doing, probably eating some humble pie with $professor, but I didn't hear any more about it.",159,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF69BB20>
794,"""why can't I do this, because I said so.""","So I work in the medical IT industry for fairly sized hospital. For the most part I actually really like my job except for the handful of troublemaker users that popup time to time. But today I had a problem that came in that was particularly juicy. Now let's call the user Edgar. Edgar is a generally nice person to talk to and a fairly smart person at that. The only problem is Edgar thinks their knowledge professionally extends into fields they don't know much about. For example they will argue with me about how certain things like sending patient info via scanned documents through software is literal faxing.  So I get a ticket from Edgar stating that they want their screen to not timeout as quick as it currently does and have the fix applied to all of the PCs in their department.  Well even I could make some snips and changes in the registry to make this happen it would get wiped out by the group policy in place within at least 24 hours and on top of that not only is the amount of time requested that the timeout occur is well beyond those that could be susceptible to creating a security risk, it also can and could potentially violate HIPPA.

 Now as a little preface to this issue I would like to add I have been asked to do this before for several people and have explain this without issue. Edgar on the other hand is different, because I simply mentioned the fact that it could be done via registry edits they were insistent that it needed to be done. Despite the fact it violates security protocol and violates the HIPAA agreement.

 I tell Edgar that I am simply not comfortable with performing this fix for this issue as the repercussions for doing this can result in termination for myself. Edgar doesn't care, Edgar wants the timeout to be longer because ""it takes too long to log in and is affecting patient care"". Now Edgar doesn't work in the OR or the emergency room I have no justification for the support group that sets group policy in place to make this a reality for them. 

Edgar still insists. I explained to them ""I am not comfortable with doing this and I have been asked to do this before and have declined. It's a security and HIPPA violation"". Edgar states that I am not professionally trained to make that assumption. This could be true as I am not a medical professional but I am a certified network technician. 

I then have to explain why this creates such a massive security risk to Edgar. I spend over an hour explaining this information to them. Edgar still cannot get over the fact that I even remotely mentioned that it is a possibility that it could be done via registry edits but again would be wiped out by group policy within 24 hours if done (which I regret letting slip out of my mouth). There's basically no point for me to do this if it could be done. 

Edgar does not care they want me to increase the timeout for their screen as if it was their last wish. Now like I said earlier I am not a medical professional, but I do know that patients can be frustrating to deal with and sometimes there is a sense of urgency when collecting patient information.

 I am certified network technician and proceed to pull out my network + and security + CompTIA certificates out of my wallet and slide them across the table to show them proof of qualifications. (Sadly I've had to do this a number of times with different users.) I explained to them what the certificates mean and that if they do not feel that I am qualified to perform the task they have asked ""I will gladly reassign the ticket to someone they do feel is qualified"". Edgar immediately back pedals and says that they are sorry ""let's start over"" (at this point the damage had already been done). 

I'm done talking by now and begin to pack up my equipment into my bag and repeat ""if you do not feel that I am qualified to troubleshoot this issue I will gladly have your ticket reassigned to someone that you feel is."" Edgar then exclaims ""why can't you do increase the timeout."" I then reply with ""because I said so.""

I do not normally treat customers this way but I was at my wit's end with trying to explain to this person why I cannot increase the time out of their computer much less to the other PCs in the rest of the department. Needless to say and to wrap up the story I submitted a complaint to Edgar's manager stating that if they were to treat me this way and call me ""unprofessional/unqualified"" that I would not be willing to assist them with further IT issues. I don't expect respect from my customers but I do expect common decency. I don't tell them that they are not qualified for their position and expect the same in return.

795,Dressing appropriately.,"There was a post in a different subreddit where the first part of this was posted as a response.   I decided I needed to finish the story, and this is the best place for it.

Many years ago, I was in tech support for major software vendor.  We had a cluster of products that all worked together with our backbone product.

On day, I received  a call from Sales folks, they have a customer who wants a meeting with someone who knows XYZ product.   I'm the TS expert for this particular product, so of course they called me.   Check schedules and with my manager, yeah I can do it on day/date.

This is the first time I've ever even met a customer, so in the morning I dithering about how to dress.  Full suit?   Just a button down?  Tie?   Finally I give up, jeans and corp polo shirt.

In the meeting room waiting on customer is my boss, the Director of TS, Sales folks, their manager and the Director of Sales.   I'm feeling seriously underdressed, as even my boss is in a button down & tie.

A few minutes later, another Sales person shows in the customer team.   Their guy in a suit, ignores everyone else, comes straight to me.   ""You must be Otter, I'm {name} Director & Sponsor of the project at our company.""  He then introduces the other 2 folks, one of who is the Tech Lead for the project.

I guess I dressed appropriately, as the customer was able to pick the techie out of a room full of people.

They explain their project and how they see our product fitting in.   They start peppering me with questions, I'm asking them questions, the white board fills with notes and diagrams.  Sales folks offer to get us drinks, our Directors say they'll get the drinks.   I found out later, the Director of Sales, didn't want his Sales guys to miss anything.

After 30 minutes, the Sales folks' eyes have glazed over.   Tech Lead and I are way deep in how the product works {I asked my boss & Director, is it ok to go this deep? Yes}.   We were completely redesigning the project.   We paused, Tech Lead looked at his Director.  ""Umm, are you ok with what we're doing?""   He nods.   So we keep going.

Another hour later, their project is now centered around our product, not just using it and the design hooks are there to use other products from us.

A few weeks later I received a $1000 bonus from the sale team.  


6 months later I was promoted, with this meeting cited as one of the reason for the promotion.  


I ended doing many technical meetings like this with customers and even ended up on the Trade Show circuit.  


ETA:   Bunch of minor fixes.

796,Objects in the Rear View Mirror,"The past is never history. It will haunt you till your dying breath and follow you like an annoying fan. Now that you are all suitably depressed let’s get on with how the past followed me to my new job. I was working for a web hosting company as phone support and was doing quite well. The start of a weekend shift had come which begins on a Friday and ends on a Monday. These shifts are great as we normally don’t take many calls so get time to study/read/watch and catchup on things.

Then something completely unexpected happens in the call centre… the phone rings. I pick up and do my spiel mentioning the web hosting company I work for and asking how I can help.

Caller: “Yeah I would like to take you up on your wine offer.” A lot of perplexed blinking ensured.

Me: “I’m sorry?”

Caller: “The one in your latest issue. It sounds like a good deal; can you tell me anything about the wines included?”

My brain has reached a terminal fault. Where am I? What year is it? What is going on? 

Caller: “This is $winecompany isn’t it?”

Did he just mention the name of the company I use to work for? At this point my brain is trying to flip its script from the new job record over to the past job record and it is scratching like a DJ during the Eurovision Song Contest.

Me: “Err no. This is $webhosting company. I think you got the wrong number.” At this point I notice ringing in the background. A lot more than normal. People are picking up calls left and right all while this scratching record in my brain is playing “aweem away” from the Lion Sleeps Tonight on repeat.

Caller: “This is the number in the magazine $number.”

Me: “Yeah that’s our number but we are a web hosting company. We aren’t $winecompany. I can’t help you.”

The call ends only to be followed quickly by another…. And another.. and they don’t stop coming, and they don’t stop coming, and they don’t stop coming. All are the same, nice elderly people wanting to purchase wine from us.. just like when I worked for $winecompany.

Turns out that what was going to be a wonderful relaxing weekend shift turned into a nightmare of constant wine calls from my past. The $winecompany in question put our number in their latest magazine instead of theirs. This wasn’t just a simple digit off we are talking about but 3 whole last digits are completely different. We had to get more people in to cover the amount of phone calls coming in and it cost the company a huge amount of money to deal with it. We were all dead by the end of the weekend. My nice tipple of wine at the end of a long shift became a grim reminder of what I had just worked through.

Well the two companies finally sat down with each other and made some sort of arrangement in regard to the problems we faced. Probably a large amount of money changing hands. What did we get in the call centre? A bottle of wine for free from $winecompany.",102,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF69BC40>

Well, 2020 was a hell of a year, wasn't it?

I finally got a lot of the things I've wanted, I've moved to a previous address of mine (an energy-efficient townhouse with three floors, and the first one has my private office), and I've officially started a foray into Texas politics (oh, come on now, we all saw that coming). I didn't expect to change jobs again, though.

I suppose the old maxim ""you don't quit bad jobs, you quit bad managers,"" is true in the end, but considering I'm posting this from Cozumel right now, well...

-----

As 2019 ended, a lot of things happened. I finally got my personal situations sorted out, I cleaned up my life, and I stopped caring about what family thought about me. My wife and I celebrated our first anniversary, and I finally realized that it's time that I started valuing time and work / life balance over being a mercenary and getting cash.

Now, the company I'd worked for since 2013 was a very good company. I came in from an Austin hospital chain that got bought out and went national, and I spent seven years working as a general tier 2 / tier 3 sysadmin, handling all kinds of accounts. I worked on things ranging from lawyers to medical practices to schools, with things ranging from IT black ops to massive remote desktop farm compromises to regulatory compliance (as you all will remember from my stories about my time there).

Unfortunately, at the end of 2018, the original management team sold the company to a venture capital firm, and when the original owners moved up to the new mothership, the HR Daleks brought in new people from outside in an attempt to standardize the firm. 

Of course, we all know how that song and dance goes.

We rejoin our hero in mid-January 2020, prior to COVID really hitting its stride...

----

""So, I'm curious what's going on here,"" I said, staring at my boss across the table. ""For the past six years, my raise has come like clockwork on the first of January, just like clockwork. It's now about to pass the twenty-first, and it's not been applied, nor have I been notified of a review. Would you mind explaining what's going on here?""

""You need to talk to $COCKWOMBLE, Jack. I'm not in on raises, for once,"" the regional director said. This man had been my boss since 2015, when he started running the show locally, and then got promoted to regional director. Of course, a month or two later, once COVID became an epidemic, he was out for a while, then resigned in order to spend time with his family. I'd been annoyed by his replacement, an annoying little jumped-up schmuck brought in by the director of ops (whom he was friends with) from a competing MSP. I should mention that he'd already pissed off nearly every legacy employee (meaning those who had been around pre-acquisition) in one way or another, but I'd been _trying_ to give him the benefit of the doubt. 

This all changed, of course, when the bastard (referred to after this as $COCKWOMBLE) made one of my friends leave work crying. At that point, I decided that he was going to get cordial treatment, _at the absolute nicest,_ because making a friend of mine cry was intolerable, especially from a mincing little shit drunk on white wine, vodka, benzos, and power who should have stayed a Red Robin shift lead, and bugger me with a rake if I didn't start pushing back.

Other - smarter - coworkers saw the writing on the walls and jumped ship for greener pastures. I worked with the most skilled and technically-versed techs in the company, and together, we formed an elite team that addressed the largest clients with the most intense needs and projects. The entire team left as a result of $COCKWOMBLE's actions - one of them grew tired of fighting his boneheaded decisions (and left to become a devops lead), another left to run the helpdesk at a startup, and another went to work as in-house IT for a private firm. 

$COCKWOMBLE, meanwhile, decided to turn what was left of the helpdesk into a cookie-cutter MSP, meaning that he did the following:

- Hired nontechnical dispatchers to assign tickets to technicians (without being arsed to actually check and see if they could handle the load or understand what the tickets actually entail before dispatching them out)

- Hired purchasing employees (who, with the exception of one employee, couldn't be arsed to quote out what we specifically named, even if we gave them part numbers and all)

- Removed the telecommuting / work-from-home program for employees, ostensibly to promote ""office culture""

- Started aggressively soliciting that employees post positive reviews on Glassdoor (using such phrases like ""clear guidance"" and the like)

- Started trimming what he considered deadwood clients (clients with low monthly recurring revenue, high ticket volume clients, et cetera)

- Turned my team's very chill office into the company lounge and put my team next to the break room and parts closet with purchasing

- Pushed hot-desking and an open office - with 100% of employees in the office 40 hours a week - _even after COVID was raging stateside_

- Strongly discouraged employees talking amongst themselves (to the point where he and the ops director said that any sort of ""backchannels among the employees would be treated as sabotaging the company""

Meanwhile, $COCKWOMBLE was, in actuality, driving morale and revenue to points to low that they couldn't be quantified, only expressed in ways that involved employees and clients leaving (willingly or otherwise).

But I digress.

I schlepped over to $COCKWOMBLE's office - the next door down - and knocked. 

""Hey, $COCKWOMBLE, got a minute? We need to talk.""

""Can you put it in an e-mail, Jack? I'm kind of busy,"" he said. 

""I see your screens in the reflection from the window behind you. You want to try again?"" I said, completely nonplussed, while I resolved to find out why the web filter we had apparently wasn't working properly.

""Fine, ugh. What's up?"" His irritation was apparent, and I figured that I'd make it quick, since he was an annoying bastard at the best of times, but he couldn't do without me... for now.

""So, as you know, I'm due for a raise. It normally hits on the first of the year, and it's three weeks in now and nothing's there. Given that it's hit every year for the past six, what's up here?""

He smirked. ""Oh, you'll have to talk to $HR_DALEK about that. I don't have control over that any more.""

""Yeah, I'm going to do that, then. I'll CC you,"" I replied, and for a second, I could see that he was _livid_ with my reply, but screw it - you shirk your responsibility, I'll call your ass on it.

""Okay, you do that,"" he said, turning his attention back to the screens (and the entirely too pasty contents therein. Good lord, his taste ran to Snow Whites and gingers). I left and walked back to my cube (half-height, too - not even a properly tall cube, but the cheap bastard bought _used_ cubicle partitions), picking up my giant TARDIS mug of coffee on the way. En route to the break room, I grumbled - I'd saved them 5,000-plus man hours the previous year by designing, creating, installing, and maintaining an imaging system that worked for _all_ our clients. It took me 40 hours to set up and test, and they saved 125 times that _that I was able to prove_ - you bet your ass I was going to push for a merit raise there.

Let's do some off the cuff math, shall we?

I spent 40 hours to design and implement that system. At my pay rate (not nearly high enough), that was a pretax labor outlay of $1150 and change. They saved 5,000-ish man-hours that year, and based off the admittedly pathetic pay that they gave a tier 1, that saved them - _ballpark_ - $90,000 (pretax) in one year (that I could prove from documentation - it was probably quite a bit higher, but I wasn't about to piss around in ConnectWise figuring it out). Even a one-time bonus of a percentage of that would be acceptable, right?

NOPE. Nothing. My ass was left out in the cold.

Meanwhile, new sysadmins were hired on making more than I made (and in Austin, that's not that much). I took evening on-call shifts to help pay the bills, and $100 a shift (pretax) wasn't much, but it was 3 hours a night, two or three times a week, and it added up. Considering that at the time, my wife wasn't working while she was in school for a Master's equivalent, and I was the only breadwinner, well, we needed the money.

I dashed off an e-mail to $HR_DALEK, CCing $COCKWOMBLE, and hit send. I didn't hear back for a week, despite repeated followups, and it was only after I turned on read receipts that I got a calendar invite for a meeting with them both.

By this point, as you can imagine, I was _royally_ pissed, and I had no intention of going in with anything less than my best imitation of Paulie from Goodfellas (""Oh, business was bad? Eff you, pay me. So you had a fire? Eff you, pay me. Place got hit by lightning? Eff you, pay me."")

I didn't expect what happened next, though.

- - - - -

_Holy shit,_ I thought as I read through a trouble ticket raised by a _very_ profitable client. The CEO was particularly demanding, asking techs to come to his house on occasion - I'd personally been out there on Christmas Eve once - and he'd asked for someone to come to their office same-day for something to do on his Mac. Of course, thanks to $COCKWOMBLE's fuckery with the queues, techs were lucky if they were running 40 tickets deep, and first-contacts were lucky if they were four hours behind the initial call in for anything but escalations.

_Please send someone who is an expert with Macs. If someone shows up and has to use Google to figure out how to transfer data, they will need to inform their managers that we will be reevaluating our relationship, and we will escort that person off site._

Instead, he got $COCKWOMBLE replying to him ripping him a new one about his tone and demeanor in a ticket, and doing so - _in writing_ - using unprofessional terms and language himself.

_While I understand if you have frustrations about our service, I still need you to muster a level of professionalism that would show our employees the respect earned with their roles._

[INTERNAL SCREAMING] didn't _begin_ to describe the mental dialogue I had going.

The CEO wasn't having any of it.

_When I return from the UK, have $ACCOUNT_MANAGER meet $CLIENT_OFFICE_MANAGER and myself at our offices. Either $COCKWOMBLE is fired, or your company is._

""I really thought I'd get in trouble for that,"" $COCKWOMBLE said, walking up to the end of the aisle of cubes. ""He was being _such_ a meanie. I'm just looking out for you all - ""

""No, you _absolute_ moron, you weren't,"" I replied. ""You've just lost us a $120,000-a-year client. You know how many clients we have that are larger than that in the Central region? _THREE._ That's right, you singlehandedly lost us a massive client and we're probably going to have to tighten our belts now. For your sake, you'd best be able to explain to $OPS_DIRECTOR why they left.""

""Oh, I already did. She and I went out last night and I told her over drinks. You didn't know?""

_YOU COLOSSAL SHITSTAIN_, I screamed internally. Out loud, though, I refrained from vulgarities. ""You know, when I was hired, it was a terminable offense to be the reason a client left, _doubly_ so if they actually called you out by name.""

""Times change,"" he smirked.

""And yet incompetence still floats to the top like feces in the toilet,"" I shot back, sipping at my coffee.

""You have your meeting with me and $HR_DALEK in two hours,"" he snapped. ""$HR_DALEK can explain a few things to you.""

""Good. I'd love to hear him explain why you're not let go for this."" I turned back to my screen. ""If you don't mind, some of us have clients to keep.""

He flounced off in a huff, and I loaded up the Play Store on my Pixel 3 XL. 

At this point, I knew I couldn't trust any of them to be honest with me (or even not gaslight me), and I figured that it was time that I went full nuclear. Knowing that Texas is a one-party state (meaning that only one party needs to be aware of and consent to audiorecording), [I downloaded an audiorecording app, then set it to hide notifications from the system tray.](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.recorder&hl=en_US&gl=US)

We all know where this is going.

799,The New Guy Chronicles - Episode 7: What is your job?,"These are the stories of the New Guy. All of what you are about to read is true. I write you these tales of mirth and woe, of entertainment and anger with as much accuracy and as little embellishment as I can manage. Many conversations are written as best I can remember them from my notes and memories about the incidents they describe, but the heart of what you are about to read is as true as I can make it.

Names have been changed to protect the innocent. And the guilty.

[Episode 6](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/plnfyz/the_new_guy_chronicles_episode_6_listen_and_obey/)

The cast:

Jordan - FNG

Thomas - Me, the manager and network admin

John - The older of my two other reports, primarily responsible for server maintenance, major application upgrades, and supporting our smaller off-site locations and their specific applications

Daniel - The younger of my two original employees, though here for the same amount of time as John. Both longer than me, actually. Desktop and server support, document management and phone system support, phenomenal people skills.

**DAY 79** - What is your job?

It's early in the morning.  I sit in my office working on managery things.  Jordan's desk is right outside my office door, which is open as usual.  The IT workgroup rings and Jordan picks up.  There are few tickets open right now for once, and I know that Jordan is not currently working on anything.  I listen with half an ear to the exchange, catching snippets like ""Internet Explorer not working"".  We do have a couple legacy systems that only work in IE.  After a few moments Jordan hangs up, and a minute later a ticket opens in our system.  [User] is having trouble with Internet Explorer.

I wait.  John and Daniel are otherwise occupied.  Along with other stories posted here, I have had several chats with Jordan about his work ethic.  He often must be reminded to answer phones and work on tickets.  He will take any excuse to shirk responsibility and sit all day, doing nothing of value.  Shocking, I know.

""Jordan, are you going to look at that ticket you put in?""

""I don’t know what’s wrong with it.  She said Internet Explorer was there, but it’s not there.  Or like it was incompatible or something.""

""What?""

""I don’t know.  She was really bad at explaining.""

""And?""

""I don't know what the problem is.""

Breathe.  Calm.  Zen.  Let the stupidity wash over you, Thomas.  Don't let it soak in.  Don't let it affect you.  You are a stone in the river, and the water must break around y-

*eye twitch*

""GO FIGURE IT OUT.""

There.  That feels better.  *twitch*

A couple hours later I call Jordan into my office for another of our chats.  

""Close the door behind you.  Have a seat.""

""What's up?""

""What is your job?""

""Helpdesk Technician.""

""And what does that entail?""

""Installing computers, installing Office...""

""What skills are required for your job?""

""Technical knowledge, common sense?""

""Problem-solving.  Yes?""

""Yeah.""

""What did you say to me earlier when I asked you if you were going to look at that ticket?""

""I said I didn't know how to fix the problem.""

""Close, but not quite.  And the distinction here is important.  You said 'I don't know what the problem is.'  The users' job, as far as interfacing with IT and putting in tickets, is to explain their problem as best they can.  Our job is to figure out and fix the problem.  What should have been the first step of your troubleshooting process?""

""Make sure the network cable is plugged in and reboot?""

""Have them show you the problem.""

At this point I decided to launch into a problem-solving exercise I've done with people before.  I pulled this from a previous issue that I had to deal with for a user.  I gave him the description of the problem I was given back when the issue actually occurred.  

""Let's do an exercise.  I'm going to give you a problem, you tell me what you'd try and I'll give you whatever information is relevant.  You're with the user at their computer.  Got it?

""Sure.""

""The internet is broken.""

""What do you mean?""

""I mean I tried to go to a webpage and it said 'page cannot be displayed.'""

""It sounds like you have a bad network cable.  Replace it?""

""Why would you do that?""

""Didn’t you say before to do the simplest thing?""

""Yes, but what makes you think replacing the cable is the simplest answer to the problem?""

""I don’t know…""

""OK.  You replaced the network cable and it didn’t fix the problem.""

""Check the network port to see if it’s active?""

""It is.""

""I don’t know what to do.""

""What have you not done?""

""I don’t know.  Check if the wireless is connected?""

""It’s not wireless.""

""I don’t know what to do.""

""What have you not done yet?""

""I don’t know.""

""You haven't asked me to show you the problem.  We just went over this.  This example comes from a ticket I was given a few years ago where I presumed the person who put in the ticket did all the basic troubleshooting and it turned out they hadn't.  I drove 45 minutes to get to the client, sat down, and said 'show me the problem.'  The next thing I know she's typing the address to her friend's cat blog (no joke here) wrong, with a D in blogspot instead of a G.  That was the whole issue.  The users explain the problem to us as best they can.  Most of them are not particularly computer-savvy and what they tell you will not necessarily correlate to reality.  It is your job to bridge that gap.  You have to figure out what they want and what is stopping them from getting it.""

""OK.  I'll try to be better about that.""

""Alright.  Good.  One last thing.  Yesterday you were sitting at the bench working on something and you belched really loudly.  You remember that?""

""Yeah.  I think it happens because I drink my water too fast.""

""OK, well, I can't help you with that problem.  But you don't have to be so loud, and you definitely don't have to follow it up by explaining to us how the belch felt.  It's gross.""

""OK, I'll work on that.""

""Thank you.""

Spoiler for remaining episodes: the belching thing got a little better in time.  The problem-solving did not.

800,"Bad news team, the UK got an inch of snow. Whole country shut down. We're taking their calls.","Many, many, many moons ago I did my coops for an antivirus company. Did the whole gamut, went from consumer to corporate support, and experienced a veritable rainbow of interactions with callers. The one that sticks out the most in my mind was when the UK got a snow storm and we got tapped for their support calls. (Ok, you got me. It wasn't an inch. I think it was three. I can't remember the exact amount, but I do recall most of my team snorting when they were told. To us, that was a mild inconvenience.) We were supposed to treat them like regular calls but relax our prohibition on profanity. With American callers we were supposed to hang up once someone started cussing in any form. UK folks were allowed to cuss unless it was specifically directed at the person on the call and they got a warning first.

It honestly didn't seem like that big a deal, I mean, they speak English, we speak English, it'll be a fun time with funny accents! And for the most part, it was! If I got lost in the sauce I would ask them to back up and slow down because I'm an American and we all know they're slow. (If you don't get the joke do everyone a favor and ponder it silently.) The folks from across the pond were pictures of magnanimity and did their very best to go slow for me. Around 5, (I was working second shift) I thought this was just going to be some fun! I knew not the linguistic adventure that was waiting for me.

As it so happens, people from the UK are time travelers, so 5pm for me is 10pm for them. I take my next call, and the voice on the other end of the line is a man who is clearly very upset with a side of moderately drunk, and I am utterly incapable of deciphering anything this man is hurling at me other than the profanity. The profanity came in loud and clear; the other noises this man was making sounded like what happens when an American tries to use English pronunciation on something written in Polish. Lots and lots and LOTS of consonants and vowels, and no meaningful information communicated. I explained to the man that I couldn't understand him and he needed to go slow for me because this was getting us nowhere. I recall specifically saying I am trying to help, please stop shouting. As it so happens, the man wasn't shouting. His voice went alllll the way up to 11. He toned it back down once he'd made it clear that he wasn't shouting previously.

Ah! A brainstorm. Since HE could understand me just fine I asked if there was anyone else home I could talk to who isn't as... Welsh. He nearly bust a gut laughing either at my idea or my description and then more sober ones, I took that to mean he was home alone.

That's not going to work. I was almost tempted to go with one grunt for yes two for no before I had a second and much better brainstorm. My last call was from a person who was perfectly comprehensible, and it had only been five minutes. That guy was super nice and I'd done a good job helping him fix his problem, maybe he'd do me a solid in return. I wasn't sure if that was a kosher thing I could do, so I peeked my head up over the cubicle wall to get my supervisor's attention. I guess he was listening to my call because his face had a look of existential horror with a side of headache pain; it brightened up considerably though when I floated my idea and I got the go ahead.

In a tech support call center first, I actually called back my last customer. Happily enough he picked up right away and asked what was up. I explained the situation with the Welshman on the other line and asked if he might be able to help me figure out what exactly he's trying to say. The man has trouble breathing afterwards from laughing so hard and says he's been to Cardiff a time or two and would be delighted to help his poorer relations across the pond. Perfect.

I conference the calls and all three of us are on the line. Irate Welsh noises greet me once I've made sure nobody got dropped. The conversation goes as follows:

Angry Welsh noises.

""Oh good Lord, I see why you were in a spot of bother""

Jovial Welsh noises.

""Not happening mate, she's been dead for years. Now what's your issue?""

Long burst of profanity laden Welsh noises.

Eventually we got his problem sorted with a minimum of fuss and bother. Ten minutes later we were sorted and he had an e-mail address to reach out to if he had further trouble. (He was on dialup and a thingummy in his software corrupted because 56k dropped packets like they were singles at a strip club. Also couldn't fix the problem whilst on the phone because 56k.)

I told him I'm not calling a translator again if I can't read his e-mail, and I got a stream of Welsh sounds in return.

I knew something was up because I didn't get an immediate translation, all the translator guy relayed from a much longer string of noise, ""He says he'll do his best.""

There's laughter over the phone from both UK folks, and then the translator says, ""No, you can't say that to a yank. It's different over there.""

""You can insist as much as you like, I'm not passing it on.""

There's a Welsh annoyed grunt and then a clicking sound.

Translator dude rushed through goodbye noises and accepted my thanks graciously. Pretty sure he rushed off the phone.

I did get a gold star (positive remark on performance review) for overcoming a language barrier in an inventive fashion. The Welshman never e-mailed a follow up, and to this DAY I occasionally wonder what could've possibly been THAT offensive.

P.S. I didn't take a dinosaur to work, this wasn't a time when 56k was very commonly encountered. I want to say it was 2009 or 2010. I'm sure someone from the UK remembers the snow holiday and can narrow it down.

801,"""I can't get to the server!"" ""But it's up?""","A quick one

A few years ago we had some maintenance work whilst the site was quiet. It's much easier to work on stuff when there's no people there complaining that stuff doesn't work.

Anyway, i'm running around recabling and rebuilding computers, but we also have some telephone engineers in setting up a new network connection (Fibre. Ooh, fancy!). I've given the engineer a key to our network closet, and told him to get on with it and give me a shout on the radio once he's done. 

Much cable running and OS reinstalling later I get a shout on the radio 

>*KRSHH* I'm all done with the network now *KRSHHH*

>Roger, pop the key on my desk and i'll walk you out

I meet the engineer on the way out, mutter some smalltalk and wish him well. 

Later on, one of my colleagues squarks across the radio 

>*KRSSHRSHH* King, i can't get to the server! *KSSSSH*

>""But it's up? I've got half a room PXe booting from it!""

>""*KSHRSRSHH* No, the key to the network room is broken, i can't get in"" *KSSSHRSHHH*

Our lovely network engineer snapped the key in the lock on the way out. And that's why after about an hour of drilling and £1500 later, we got new fancy electronic locks on the network closet.",91,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF69BEE0>
802,Chili or email. You can't have both.,"This story happened some years ago to one of my car dealer clients. I had worked with these folks for over ten years at this point, so little surprised me when ""issues"" cropped up. The building they were in was several decades old and their power needs proved it. One Saturday morning the wife and I were heading to the ""big city"" to do some shopping when I get a call from the dealership. 

Manager – One of several on hand.

Salesperson – No description needed.


Me answering the phone – ""Hello. This is Me""

Manager – ""Hey Me we're not getting any email and I can't send any either. I can surf the Internet just no email. Oh and I think WiFi is down also.""

Me – ""Will that's not right. Any power issues?""

This is an industrial area of the city and the power company liked to perform work on the weekends while it wasn't as busy.

Manager – ""No power has been good so far. We need to get the email going again. I'm waiting for some important messages from New Car Manufacturer that I need yesterday. If we can't send any emails to clients we could lose sales. It's really important we get this fixed ASAP..."" Continue more droning on about the importance of his email.

Stopping him mid-sentence.

Me – ""Okay no problem. Wife and I were already heading to nearby shopping destination, so I'll be there in about 10 minutes.""

Upon my arrival I head directly to the server room and find UPS's complaining about being on battery and the email server powered down. Okay, we do have a power issue. Checking the rest of the room I find the primary Dealer Management System, DHCP Server, Parts Catalog, Routers and Switches are all up and running. WiFi controllers and of course the Email Server are down. I'm checking power feeds when Manager pokes his head in and continues to tell me how important email is with several sales people in the behind him complaining about no WiFi.

Me - ""I know. Trying to find out why portions of my racks don't have power. So no power glitches happened after you guys opened? Email was working when you got here?""

Manager – ""Yea, no lights flickered and was able to access email right away. Then the sales people started complaining about WiFi.""

At this point I'm now headed to the hallway where the electrical panels were located. All five of them. With some of the worst labeling I've ever seen. Decades of labels, marker, crayon of locations that were mostly unreadable. Random Salesperson walks up.

Salesperson – ""Hey Me, are you looking for the breaker for the lunchroom?""

Me – ""No, some power is out on the server racks and I'm trying to figure out why.""

Salesperson – ""Well if you find the one for the lunchroom let me know. The toaster isn't working""

Me – ""Well okay but not my priority at the moment.""

You see this building used to be a Big Box Hardware store before they got bigger. During the dealership renovation apparently the electricians did not trace or update the labeling of the electrical circuits in the whole building. Old or new. During the renovation of the building I did remember seeing the old plans and that the server room and neighboring storage rooms used to be the manager offices for Big Box Hardware. In the forth panel I finally find an old label for ""manager office"" and find the tripped breaker. I reset the breaker and turn it back on and seconds later it trips again. In the mean time I hear from down the hall...

Salesman – ""Hey you found it! Nope, it's off again!""

What. The. Hell. 

I go into the lunch room and find him at the toaster with a bagel inside and next to it a crock pot full of warm chili. Staff lunch has killed portions of the network. As I came to realization that several of the lunch room receptacles were on the same circuit as parts of the server room some 50 feet away, my level of cursing began to rise. With Salesman's help we moved the crock pot and toaster to the other side of the room which was still working. I reset the breaker and began to curse the original electricians as I brought the systems back up in the server room. I then retrieve my trusty label maker and label the breaker and receptacles. Adding warnings to each location just in case. I updated management working that day that their lunch brought down their email and my wife and I continued our shopping spree. Me being pretty irritated at the comedy of errors.

The following Monday I contact General Manager and explain what happened. I also let him know that I was making an executive decision and that I contacted their electrician and had him add multiple 30 amp circuits to the server room. Always the professionals, they also traced the remaining receptacles in the room and labeled them. To prevent further interruption I set aside a late evening trip onsite to move the UPS's over to the new circuits and all was right with the world again. 

Hope that chili was worth it.",122,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF69BF70>
803,"Hey, I can't get to the server...","This is a short one.  Years ago, I was in charge of IT for a medium sized (\~50k people) municipality.  One day, we start getting reports from Village Hall that people can't get to the main file server.  My office is in our lovely trailer next door, so I walk over to have a look at one of the problem computers.  Sure enough...she can't get there.  I jump into a command prompt and do some checks and what the heck...where did this IP come from?  The computer had an address from a DHCP server that wasn't ours.  After a bit of ""sh ip arp"" and ""sh mac address-table"", I found the offending port and disconnected it.  Unfortunately, we never had great documentation of where all of the ports were, so we had to do some hunting.  In relatively short order, I found the culprit.  Being a public building, the Village Hall was used for early voting.  With no notice to us, the county sent people in to setup the conference room used for this purpose.   Whoever they sent to do the setup plugged in a regular Linksys router to the network jack in the room.   I unplugged it, resisted the urge to make it permanently inoperable, and put it in a box with a note to \*not\* plug it in again.",114,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF69BEB0>
804,"User: It hurts when I do this! <punches self in face> Support: Well, don't do that!","My first post here, though I’ve been a lurker for a while and enjoyed many of your stories.

In a previous job I was responsible for (among other things) a large distributed application (pseudo-microservice on the backend) with a heavy user client that had a legacy predating Win32, on a site with a few hundred users.
After an update to the system, users began reporting crashes. At first this seemed to be random, but eventually it appeared to be user-specific and would follow them from machine to machine. A few special users in particular made a lot of noise about it, raising hell to their boss.

After due investigation it became apparent that initiating too many rapid-fire keypresses would cause a stack underflow in a particular module of the heavy client. When I say too many rapid presses, I mean that on a mechanical keyboard the input would sound like machine gun fire. This was obviously a bug in the software, in that it was not checking the state of the stack before trying to pop something off it. Since it was reproducible and the logs traced the appropriate section of code (to the line), the developers were able to fix it pretty rapidly; however, on a large legacy production system (created when nobody had ever even heard of CI or DevOps) in a 24/7 production environment, patching isn’t something that can just be done arbitrarily – it has to be explicitly planned. Clearly it’s not ideal, but this constraint is both a consequence of the nature of the business environment and a lack of political will to enforce regular preventative maintenance. Run it into the ground and wonder why it crashes! #YOLO

Once the root cause was identified, the users were advised (both in person and on an email blast) not to mash their keyboards until a fix was delivered, validated, and deployed.
Regardless, the boss of the problem users called my boss and I to the carpet about the issues that were plaguing their team and absolutely preventing any productive work from happening. The sky was falling! The three of us sat at a small table in angry boss’s office and listened to approximately 10 minutes of ranting. At an appropriate interlude, I interjected that it was in fact a serious issue, and I could demonstrate it to see how big a deal it was. I walked over to the angry bosses desk, opened the client on their machine, spun the monitor around so it was visible from the table, and proceeded to demonstrate normal behavior with a reasonable rate of input. I then ratcheted up the input rate bit by bit, with the software still performing normally. It wasn’t until I hit the rate and approximate force of the GAU8 Avenger (brrt gun in the A10 Warthog) on the keyboard that the software crashed. Any harder and I would have broken the thing in half. The formerly angry boss, now horrified about the thrashing I had just given their keyboard, was silent. My own boss simply smirked, which translated to immense restrained joy and schadenfreude.

I then pointed out that I already had a fix from the developers, but the blocker for deployment was their own production schedule and a lack of cooperation from their team in scheduling the maintenance. The now apologetic boss quickly carved out a maintenance window for us, and later that day called his subordinate leadership into a meeting and admonished them for overdramatizing the issue. Whether through lack of reporting or users no longer mashing keys, the issue effectively evaporated between that day and the maintenance window that actually fixed the bug several days later.

We also had our IT director replace the angry bosses keyboard for good measure.",22,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0AC1D90>
805,Tales From Y2k support," 

I have been doing this too long.  
I had started in Support at $\_access\_control\_vendor a year before. I had become a Senior support person after several of my cohort had departed. As Y2k approached, our manager set up this plan for New Years.  
The entire team would be at the office with the seniors arriving at 3pm to handle flow from global customers, and the juniors arriving at 8pm. So 12 of us got our stuff squared away, Some of the guys had brought sleeping bags.

We were getting no calls. We had done a three year effort to weed out the bug, but we were sure not everyone had done their software and firmware upgrade.

The phone rang. A staffer at a Friendly European defense ministry was doing a check-in to find out if any of their critical defense or infrastructure sites had had issues, and to request notification if they did. ""No calls"" we said.  
Management brought in a ton of food at 8pm, and the phone rang every ten minutes or so with another integrator or command center asking if any problems had been reported.  
After dinner one of the guys announced he had brought Unreal tournement, and our most senior tech opened some ports... soon we were all in our cubes eagerly trying to kill each other while we waited for the sky to fall at Midnight.

As soon as New years came on the East Coast we had shut the game down, and had our plan together for call taking rotation ect. We were all sure that the phone would be off the hook by 12:30 or so.

The check-in calls kept coming in.  
Then we got an actual call. The user hadn't upgraded. The old version had a known bug. They would schedule an immediate upgrade.  
And that was it. As we approached New years at each time zone, people would call in asking for status, and then the calls would stop.  
We played video games for another eight hours or so (getting paid holiday pay, plus double time and a half for every hour over 8.) They sent the juniors home first. Then the seniors who wanted to go.  
By six AM there were six of us left.  
A follow-up crew came in at noon. They reported four calls over the next day, all customers who had missed their updates.  
Our last y2k call came in six months later, from a customer who noticed their reports were off. Not only did they need help with the update, but they needed to find their server, which a helpful soul had drywalled over the closet it was in. They hadn't done an update in six years. Nothing did uptime like a VAX.",58,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0AC1E20>

Time for a wibbly wobbly timey wimey flashback to the early aughts. I was working first level helpdesk for Big Blue Construction Company in Edinburgh. We had construction sites all over Scotland, from one or two guys with picks and shovels to replacing multi-mile lengths of motorway cutting through the Central Belt.

&#x200B;

The internets were a big thing then, with clients demanding regular and frequent reports via email. The problem with this was that, for the guys in remote rural Scotland and/or on the Western or Northern Isles, internet access could well be GPRS on their Nokia mobile phone.

&#x200B;

This site... wasn't one of them. It was a huge, prestige site. It was so important, and so long lasting, that they managed to source ADSL from Brutish Telecon, at a stunning 512/256 kb. The construction guys loved being able to hit send on an email and - it sent! Poof! Gone!

&#x200B;

The site secretary, the glue that held the whole thing together with her comprehensive knowledge of the company and the client, was Jane. Jane was a sincerely lovely person. I loved working with her because she would do \*what I asked her to do\* without trying to interpret what I was saying. When Jane called I'd usually drop everyone else because she was so super nice, and on the odd occasion I managed to visit her on site she'd have a lovely cuppa tea and a plate of biscuits ready. (This wasn't just for me - she did this to all the tech guys, or the client reps, or the random lost dude, she was just hard wired that way. As I said - super nice lady! And somewhat of a unicorn...)

&#x200B;

So, Jane calls in a panic, late on a Thursday. The deadline for this report was tomorrow morning, 9am,  and this report was the one that'd get Big Blue Construction Company paid the first tranche of money for the project, a high 6 figure / low 7 figure chunk of cash at \*this\* stage. So it was a ""drop everything"" priority. Needless to say, Jane was up to high do about it.

&#x200B;

First things first. Calm Jane down, because I was having difficulty making out what she was saying. Bats could hear her fine, mind.  Calm her down, get her to tell me what's going on. Jane had compiled the reports from everyone else. Site engineers, construction supervisors, architects, etc etc, along with lovely photos showing progress, into one nice big PowerPoint.

&#x200B;

Tech time. BBCC used NT4 desktop / laptop, NetWare and Windows servers (this was a transition time when the NetWare servers were being slowly replaced by Windows servers in BBCC), and GroupWise as the email client. GroupWise did a nice thing - if you emailed an attachment to loads of people, it would upload just the one copy of the attachment, then send a link to the stored version to the recipients, so that you didn't end up with loads of copies of the same thing cluttering up your email server.

&#x200B;

There is one caveat to that, though. It would do the one copy thing for everyone on your server. For those outside your company? Individual copies. To several dozen client rep type people. Of a 100-plus megabyte PowerPoint presentation. Over a 512/256kb ADSL connection. That everyone else on site was also using for equally business critical \*cough\* streaming radio \*cough\* purposes.

&#x200B;

Yeah. I explained to Jane this wasn’t going to work. Well, it would – just it’d take probably the weekend to upload the copies to our server which would then blitz it out, several days late and causing financial penalties.

&#x200B;

“But what can I DOOOO?!?!?” she wailed.

&#x200B;

And that was when Jane learned couriers were still available. And she had a CD burner. And yes, I’d get one of our guys to drop off a bunch of blank CDs as she was worried she wouldn’t have enough. Yes, he got a nice cuppa tea and some biscuits...

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

TLDR: weebles wobble but they don’t fall down, they just courier stuff around and around and around and around and…..

&#x200B;

807,The New Guy Chronicles - Episode 6: Listen and Obey,"These are the stories of the New Guy. All of what you are about to read is true. I write you these tales of mirth and woe, of entertainment and anger with as much accuracy and as little embellishment as I can manage. Many conversations are written as best I can remember them from my notes and memories about the incidents they describe, but the heart of what you are about to read is as true as I can make it.

Names have been changed to protect the innocent. And the guilty.

[Episode 5](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/pki8ry/the_new_guy_chronicles_episode_5_career_change/)

The cast:

Jordan - FNG

Thomas - Me, the manager and network admin

John - The older of my two other reports, primarily responsible for server maintenance, major application upgrades, and supporting our smaller off-site locations and their specific applications

Daniel - The younger of my two original employees, though here for the same amount of time as John. Both longer than me, actually. Desktop and server support, document management and phone system support, phenomenal people skills.

Laurie - My director.  Also the director of the business department.

**DAY 63** - Listen and Obey

Something that has been a problem with Jordan from the start is trust.  Less than two weeks in and he [lied about a password written on a sticky note and threw his coworker Daniel under the bus](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/pemwdf/the_new_guy_chronicles_episode_2_the_betrayal/) in the process.  Only a couple weeks later, in a story I can't post because of sub rules about phishing stories, he again lied about something I already knew the whole truth about.  I had to drag the truth out of him while explaining that trust is important.  He also commented one day during a conversation amongst all of us in IT ""You guys know how hard it is to pull one over on my mom.""

On this day his lie cost us only time, but revealed to me the true desperation of the situation I was in and how little help I would have from above.  

Jordan was sent to install a very old, very finnicky program for a user.  There are specific instructions for installing this program that must be followed to the letter, and they are detailed in a document entitled [Program] Installation Instructions.docx in the program's directory on our public IT drive.  The document includes detailed instructions, screenshots, and links to various files.  Before sending Jordan on the installation, John showed him the location of the guide, went through the guide with him, and explicitly instructed him to follow the guide's exact procedures when installing.  I heard all this transpire.

Cue SpongeBob ""A few minutes later...""  Jordan calls and John picks up.

""So, [program] isn't running correctly.  It opens, but when they try to do anything it gives [error].""

""And you followed the instructions in the guide when installing it?  You clicked the link to the installer?""

""Yeah.""

""OK.  Let's try a few things.""

What followed was several minutes of troubleshooting what can actually be an incredibly tricky program.  It's old, unsupported, and uncooperative.  After around 10-15 minutes of troubleshooting, John asks again.

""So when you installed this you clicked the link in the guide for the installer, right?""

""Well... No.  I went into the folder and picked the installer that I thought looked right.""

""Jordan...  Alright.  Uninstall it, reboot, and install it again.  *Follow the instructions this time* and let me know if it doesn't work.""  *click*

John looked at me with frustration and anger in his eyes, and I promised him I'd do my best to have something done about the situation.

**DAY 70**

*in Laurie's office*

Laurie: ""Jordan, we brought you in here to talk about a miscommunication with John the other day.""

Me: ""You went through the process of installing with John and Daniel beforehand, right?""

Jordan: ""Yes.""

Me: ""And they explained the process and the installation guide?""

Jordan: ""Yes.""

Me: ""When you called down for help what was the first thing John asked you?""

Jordan: ""I don't remember.""

Me: ""He asked you if you'd followed the instructions and clicked the link in the installation guide.""

Jordan: *shocked Pikachu face* ""He did?  I don't remember that.""

I sat there thinking we had him this time.  It was not to be.

Laurie: ""Is it possible that you weren't paying attention and you weren't listening to what John said?""

Jordan: ""Maybe.  I must not have been.""

Laurie: ""Do you think you can work on doing better at that in the future?""

Jordan: ""Yes.  I'll try to do better about paying attention.""

I knew that he was lying, and I knew that he was just taking the out that Laurie had given him to save face.  

Me: ""Jordan, do you understand how difficult it is for people to work with you when they can't trust that what you say is the truth?""

Jordan: ""I do.""

Me: *staring him in the eyes* ""Whether it's because you aren't paying attention to what's going on or because you're lying to cover for yourself, if I and your coworkers can't trust that what you're saying is true and accurate, it's extremely difficult to work with you.""

Jordan was excused a minute later and I spoke directly with Laurie.

""You know he was lying, right?""

""I don't know.  Maybe he just really wasn't paying attention.""

""He was lying to save his own skin and keep himself from looking bad.  It's what he always does.  He did the same thing when he threw Daniel under the bus for the password issue and when he lied to me about the phishing email.  This is the third time, Laurie.  How are we supposed to work with him?""

""We'll see.  Maybe he'll get better.""

""You know as well as I do that if anyone else acted like he is they'd have been gone weeks ago.""

""You're probably right.  But it's tricky.""

""Look.  I'm relying on you, Laurie.  Obviously no one cares what I think because they didn't let me actually write him up for lying last time.  You're my director and I'm bringing this to your attention.  I can't do anything.""

""I'll see what we can do.  Just keep notes on everything he does in case we need it.""

""Alright.  I'll keep notes.  Just know that John and Daniel have both told me multiple times they can't keep this up.""

808,A user let the magic smoke out of the surge protector,"Here's a pretty tame one from this morning:

A ticket tells me that a user's surge protector has stopped working. They've hit the reset but their monitors/PC won't turn on.

I walk over to the office to investigate and find the surge protector with burn marks around one of the outlets. 

There's monitors, a PC and printer plugged into the other plugs, none of them working.

I ask the worker what they had plugged into the last outlet.

A space heater. 

Replaced the surge protector and had a nice discussion about how high voltage appliances need to go directly into the wall, NOT a surge protector.

Luckily none of the other devices were fried.

Happy Friday!

Edit: I've been told by a great number of people that voltage is not the correct term. Power draw. I'm tech support not an electrician",251,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0AC1F40>
809,The easiest overtime ever,"Hello! No, this isn't the story mentioned in my last post, I'm still figuring out how to tell that one, but this story crossed my mind and I thought it would be interesting to tell.

Players:

Me: I'm here!


This took place, oh, about four years ago now. Our IT infrastructure company had been contracted to install the data, access control, and camera systems for a new tortilla factory. There was actually very little data and access control, mostly limited to WAPs and the administration areas. There were, however, over 100 cameras, with complete coverage of the production and packaging areas. Because they wanted HD quality recording practically 24/7, they needed a seven-figure camera server to handle the video.

All of that was not particularly difficult, and it was even quite fun to learn how to configure the cameras and add them to the system. The issue came after they had their electrical inspection.

They failed so hard that the owners fired the electrician for gross incompetence. (For reference on how bad it was, one of the feeder lines for a breaker panel was attached to the wall by screwing through the conduit.) They then hired a new electrician who called all hands on deck to make it right.

So how do I fit in to all of this? How do I get the easiest overtime ever?

One Saturday, they needed to completely shut off power to the half of the building that contained the main communication room. This meant their fancy camera server would go offline. As we weren't done configuring the system, we hadn't turned over the passwords, so we had to go handle it in person.

My boss explained this to me Friday afternoon. He then gave me the following instructions:

1. Ask the electricians for a corded plug to feed the UPS from a powered part of the building.

2. If that failed, log in and perform a graceful shutdown to protect the system from possible corruptions due to the UPS shutting down.

If you are like how I was at the time, you might be thinking ""why do we need to shut it down if there's a UPS?"" Turns out that the UPS only lasts for about 30 minutes, it's only ever meant to be a bridge until the onsite backup generators kick in.

I arrive onsite and my first order of business is to find an electrician. Done, they're everywhere. Then the conversation goes a little something like this:

Me: ""hey, do you guys have a corded plug?""

Electrician: ""the hell is a corded plug?""

We go back and forth, asking other electricians, calling my boss for clarification (he only ever repeats the term 'corded plug' like that's perfectly clear) for about an hour. As we're coming up on t-zero for power-off, the electrician finally says:

""Wait, does he mean 'extension cord?' Because yes, we have some of those, but none long enough for what you need.""

*Primes.exe has stopped responding*

I rush in to the comm room and log in, shutting the server down just as they hit the disconnect and the lights go dark. I then call my boss to ask if I need to do anything else.

""Nope, the system will start automatically when they turn the server back on. Come on home, you still have a lawn to mow.""

Did I mention my boss is also my dad?

So that's the story of getting paid an hour of overtime for shutting down a server.

Edit: TLDR:  took an hour to figure out what a corded plug was before shutting down the server.

PS: part of why my story in the works is stalled is because I can't think of a clever fake name for a shipping company, any ideas?",64,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0AC1FA0>
810,The credentials are not working...,"First time poster, I hope I don't screw it up.

So that one clients VPN Access to work from home isn't working anymore. He calls me and asks for help.

Turns out his credentials are wrong. As I don't know his actual credentials I reset them (VPN is separate), test them directly against the VPN-Server and tell him the new password (standard length, a number, you know the drill). He is happy and I erase that case from my to-do list.

One week later he calls again to ask for the password again. No bad feelings, a weekend formats anyones brain sometimes. I tell him the password again and he then says: ""Yes I have been trying that"". We go through the password letter by letter and after I am certain he has the right one I connect remotely to his machine.

As he is in the office right now, I can't test the VPN Client, but I can use the VPN user portal which uses the same credentials. As I am putting his user name in he gets confused. ""I am supposed to put my name there?""

Turns out he tried the password in the user field and his AD-Password as password. Just when I thought I had seen everything something like this happens...",22,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0AC3040>
811,I pressed the other button,"So, obligatory warning: first time poster, on mobile.


Now I don’t officially work tech support. I like to say that I am Tier 0 IT-I handle the things that don’t need to get escalated to the help desk.


Had a fun little 2-parter today. To make sense of this, my coworkers use mobile workstations, which have an internal battery pack, and all the workstations log into a virtual desktop when you tap your ID or enter your username/password. This virtual desktop is *supposed* to start automatically when you log in…


So, coworker calls me over: “Can you look at the computer in X room? It’s black and isn’t doing anything. I tried unplugging everything and pushing the buttons (on the monitor-the actual computer is locked inside the workstation to guard against overzealous users), and it’s not doing anything.”
Me: “Is it making noise?” (The last time I got an issue like this, the computer was fine, but the monitor was unplugged, so I’m assuming that’s the problem here.)
Coworker: “No.”


So into the room I go, and the computer isn’t doing anything at all. Check the indicator lights on the workstation. Battery fully charged. Alarms muted. Power…power? Press power button on workstation. Computer starts turning on.
Coworker: “What did you do?”
“I pressed the other button.” (I wasn’t a total jerk. I did proceed to show coworker where that power button was so next time I don’t have to be called in to fix this.)


5 minutes later: “Can I bother you again? That computer still isn’t working right. The icons aren’t showing up.”


Now this is a fairly simple one, so I just talked the coworker through manually initiating the virtual machine and hey presto! It works!


This really isn’t the coworker’s fault-these are both common issues that I have to deal with almost weekly. This just happens to be the first time in a while they occurred together.",19,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0AC30A0>
812,The report won’t open on the email,"I get a call this afternoon from LA. She requested a report and the email she was sent didn’t have it. I went and asked LC about it.

She opens up the email she sent and clicks on the attachment. What opens up is, the email she sent. I have no clue how she managed to send a copy of the email on the email. 

I look in her documents to find this excel report. It doesn’t exist. I ask her how she saved it. 

“You know how it asks if you want to save it before you close? I did that.”

I couldn’t speak. To save an excel document, she hit the x to close it. Somehow (shockingly enough) she closed it without saving. Report is gone, wiped from existence.

I inform her she’s going to have to do it again. I teach her how to save a document, and then watch as she tries to save it as a folder instead of a file. I went ahead and saved the blank document for her on her desktop so she can easily find it tomorrow.

I went back to my desk and came to terms with the idea that some people out there only save documents by hitting the x to close them and relying on the prompt.",199,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0AC3100>

Ticket Description: My mouse is sideways  


The IT techs in the room are trying to decipher what this user could be referring to. She's been with the company about 4 weeks, taking over from another staff member so no one really knew her very well yet.  
We had a myriad of guesses originally ranging from, 'Perhaps she's flipped her screen so the mouse is moving side to side when she wants it to be moving up and down'. 'Perhaps she's just an idiot and expects IT to literally turn her mouse up the right way on her desk'.  


The Answer: The previous user had brought in their own ergonomic mouse where your hand rests basically sideways and left it behind when they departed. Simple job to fix at least!",129,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0AC3160>
814,The card IS in the box.,"So I currently work for a retail department store (the one with the big yellow spark on the blue background) in the electronics department. It's not officially tech support but I get the same ~~idiots~~ customers and Karens you do. And on a strictly unofficial basis we do minor phone support mostly how do I add my minutes (call 611), how do I transfer my number (call 611), etc.

Anyway on to the story:

Two players me and id10t who we will call ""goober"" or ""goob"" for short

*Phone rings*


Me: Hello. Electronics.


Goob: yeah I bought a Samsung Galaxy S20 5G FE for *prepaid carrier*  2 days ago and I need to know what I press on the screen to activate and transfer my number to the new phone.


Me: well first of all you don't do it on the new phone. You call 611 on your old phone.


Goob: yeah but don't they need a serial number or something?


Me: yes sir, all that info is on a red activation card in the box.

Goob: I don't think it's in there it's a small box.

The next two minutes consist of a back and forth of me insisting it's in there and him insisting it isn't. I couldn't understand why he kept insisting it wasn't there you can't miss it. I thought maybe it was an assembly error or something. I was about to suggest he bring it in but that was the ONLY one we had and he bought it. Then suddenly I had a thought but I was thinking no he can't be THAT dense.


Me: Sir have you actually opened the box? 


Goob: no the tape is still around it.


Me (literally facepalming): okay why don't you open the box and see if it's there?


Goob: well hold on I gotta get a pen knife 


Me: ok


He finally comes back, opens the box, and....lo and behold the card is in there. We finish up and I hang up.

My first thought: I don't get paid enough for this sh*t. My second thought: I need a beer.


Tl/dr: guy buys the most expensive prepaid cell phone we carry and two days later needs me to tell him to open the box.",63,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0AC31C0>

Daniel - The younger of my two original employees, though here for the same amount of time as John. Both longer than me, actually. Desktop and server support, document management and phone system support, phenomenal people skills.

**DAY 59** - Career Change?

Two months.  Two months of torment and still Jordan lives.  It is truly a testament to the patience and forbearance of myself and my two other employees.  He has continued wallowing in what can only be described as unsettlingly consistent failure.  In some ways he learns.  Some users have described a slight but noticeable improvement, however I and my compatriots see it for what it truly is: trivia.  He learns facts; sometimes he memorizes processes.  He is, however, like a machine.  Without understanding.  Regurgitating answers and performing only the most basic of assigned tasks through sheer rote memorization until his programming goes awry or a stray variable leads him off script and he flounders until rescued and reset.  Yes, he is a machine.  Where a machine has metal, he has meat.  Where a machine has a battery he has iced coffee and 5-hour energy.  And like any simple machine his programming relies on if/then, incapable of straying outside explicit instructions to solve problems.

Occasionally this machine of meat and sadness does attempt to break the bonds of ""if, elseif, else"".  These are invariably dark, troubling, baffling times.  

Again, Jordan is sent to help after an office has been re-arranged.  After some time he called up to our office and in short order I heard the sound of confusion in John's voice.  I stepped out of my office and over to John's desk to listen in.  John asks a question, clearly not understanding what Jordan wants or needs.

""OK, what do you need?""

""A wall plate with an outlet.""

""You mean a network port?""

""No, an outlet.""

I decided to wade into the mire.

""What's the problem, Jordan?""

""Well, the power cord for the printer isn't long enough and I was wondering if we have any wall plates with outlets because there's a blank plate on the wall next to where the printer is now.""

""Ignore that.  Where's another outlet?""

""That's what I'm saying, I don't see one over here but there's a blank plate like maybe there used to be outlets here, but I think they took them out when they moved things around.  I thought if we had any plates with outlets we could put one in.""

""Jordan.  We are not electricians.  We do not have electrical supplies and we do not install outlets.  Find another one.""

""There's not one though.""

""Then where is the computer plugged in?""

I could hear him shift where he was standing or sitting and place the phone against his chest as he asked the user where the computer was plugged in.  I could also hear the incredulity in the user's voice when she answered.

""It's... under the desk.""

""She says it's under the desk.""

I decided to let him think the problem out.

""OK.""

After a few seconds he responded, having apparently realized I was not going to elaborate.

""The cord isn't long enough to reach under the desk.""

""OK.""

Painful seconds passed.

""Do we have any extension cords?""

""Yes, Jordan, we do.""

A couple minutes later Jordan silently passed through our office to the storage area and back out.  He completed the task set before him, and here the tale should end.  As I'm sure you all can guess, however, the end has not quite come.  This is Jordan, after all.  

Daniel was later working on a problem close to the office where Jordan briefly considered a career as an electrician (a career which I'm sure would have been short-lived, albeit lively) and checked in on the apprentice's work.  Luckily so, because our intrepid young failure-bot had chosen as the solution to bridge the gaping two-foot chasm between the printer's power cord and the outlet - a 15-foot power strip.  This he left, along with the network cable, completely unorganized and strung across the middle of the floor where our dear elderly user could trip over it.  

The mess was cleaned up, photos were taken, and Jordan's metaphorical nose was rubbed in the metaphorical poop on the living room carpet.  Time would pass.  Life would continue.  Seasons would change.  Jordan's problem-solving abilities would not.

816,Hiding issues,"This turned into a bit of a rant... enjoy!

I'll never understand why users think they can blame IT for issues they don't tell us about.

The company I work for uses an IBM AS/400 ERP system. The print routing is an absolute nightmare, and one of the departments on my site has been having trouble for years with prints not going to the correct printer.

I've lost count of the hours we've spent with the team leader, following his directions for what he wants, setting up the print tables and troubleshooting why it isn't working. We'll eventually get it sorted and he will say 'yep, that's exactly how I want it.' 

Within a couple months, he's moaning again. Nothing has changed with the configuration, but it's no loner perfect... has he raised a ticket to tell us? Yeah, right.

It got to a point a few months ago that the operations director got involved. I was angry because it made it look like he wasn't getting onsite support and we arranged an entire day to go through the printing issues once again.

That done, and assured by him that it was exactly how he wanted it, we then held 2 months of weekly meetings to make sure there weren't any further issues.

He stopped attending the meetings after the first 2, but the site manager and IT manager continued, so I did too. I also made sure to ask the user every time I saw him if there were any issues. Every time I asked his response was 'It's perfect, thank you!'

Until today - about a month after the final weekly meeting.

'It's never been right, it's always been shit, why can't IT just fix it?'

I'm leaving the company in 10 days to start a new job. I'm pretty maxed with making sure I can give a smooth handover. I don't have time for his BS any more.

'Have you raised a ticket?' I ask.

'What's the point?'

'How on earth do you expect IT to know there is an issue when, for the last 3 months you've told us that it's perfect, unless you raise a ticket? You know exactly what you need to do and you've left it too late for me to fix it, so good luck getting someone to travel down from the head office to help you out.'

I'm generally very patient with users, but I'm got no sympathy for him any more. I feel sorry for my replacement that will have to deal with him - I've been in IT support for 7 years and he is the most frustrating user I've had to deal with.",25,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0AC3280>

I have one user who **refuses** to put her documents in onedrive. She **NEEDS** them to be on her desktop, it is the only way she can work, they CANNOT be anywhere else. (Desktop sync isn't enabled on her machine and I can't get her to give it up long enough to turn it on.)

So I say we can move them to onedrive, I swap the drive, then we can move them back. **NO!** You cannot put those files in onedrive! I cannot function if those files ever exist anywhere else! Even temporarily!

(I tell all users that I do not back up laptops. If they are worried about important files they need to keep them on onedrive. I had one user who lost critical files because she refused to keep them in onedrive because it was too complicated, then her HDD crashed. A few months later she dropped the laptop and lost critical files again. After that she started keeping everything in OD)

Ok, so if you won't back up your files then I'll clone the drive. Instead of 30 minutes plan on me keeping the laptop for 8 hours. Or stay with the slow drive. You have three choices here, one gives you a faster drive and keeps important files safe, the other two do not. Your choice.

So she sighed and got all snotty but handed in her laptop. Before I had a chance to start the cloning process I got sidetracked with a major system outage, a CxO with an urgent state-required problem, a user who was pissed that I was asking her to walk 20 feet to the next printer because the one she wanted to used was just delivered and not fully configured yet (and copped an attitude because scanning 120 pages in full color results in a file too large to send via email), had two walkthroughs with cabling contractors, an HR director who didn't understand why she couldn't access the files that were saved in an underling's personal onedrive folder after said user left and her account was turned off, a printer that wasn't working until the tech got here then stopped working again the moment he left, had to complete the training of a key employee because the person who was supposed to do the training didn't finish and a few others things.

Two hours into the 8 hour window I had given the first user - before I had even had a chance to start on the cloning process the ""the world will end unless this file is on my desktop!"" user demanded her laptop back right that second because she had an important meeting. She was lucky I hadn't started yet so I told her to just take it back. I'll deal with it later.

I'm going to miss the chaos. I thrive in this kind of environment. Good luck finding somebody to replace me.

818,"""Please stop asking me to do that.""","I have a person in my organization who just REFUSES to use the support ticket system.  She either calls or directly emails a person in the department. 

I have instructed every person to continue to help her, but in the response say, ""You can continue to email me directly for help, but please also cc our ticket system with this email.""

The email automatically opens a ticket.  She still doesn't do it.  Recently I started only attaching the documentation or solution or fix to the tickets that we've opened for her and she has complained multiple times to everyone that we aren't helping her.  Today she complained that every time we respond to her emails we say ""Please also cc the ticket system"".  She wants us to stop saying that in every email response to her. 

THEN START DOING IT.

819,This is urgent! Fix this right now! But s week later....,"Got a call from a vip working at home. He complained that his computer was too slow, it took forever for zoom to load, he wanted a faster machine right now! Very colorful in his vocabulary, call log shows he spent a little over 4 minutes on the phone telling me he wanted a faster machine.

He's a vip, I'm not willing to fight his expectations so by the end of the day there is an i7-11000 with 16GB of memory and a shiny nvme drive. It doesn't get any faster until you change the first digit of the purchase price to a 3.

I let him know that he has to come in to pick it up. He has to log in to the domain before he can take it home and I don't do house calls.

Two weeks later, guess which laptop wasn't that critical after all? I guess the existing one is fast enough after all.

The caller is an automated recording trying to collect from ""Bob"" (Can't be bothered to try and remember actual name).

I tried the nice approach and called them back via caller ID to inform them that they have the wrong number and no one at our number goes by ""Bob"". They said they would take care of it. They didn't.

So, not so nice approach invoked. I programmed our phone system to route calls from their caller ID right back to them on the same number. Now they are receiving the same annoying calls daily and I'm kind of hoping they don't figure out how it is happening. 

I just checked and can confirm that 10 calls have been routed this way since August 27th with the most recent being today so they havent figured it out yet.

821,"How to invalidate your service contract in two easy steps, the sequel.","Hey TFTS, once again it's me, Jackalfeed. I work in the petrol industry, maintaining and supporting gas stations with everything from their point of sales, at-pump card readers, back office servers, and more. This is my third post, and you can read my first [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/oa3lx1/the_screams_from_the_server_closet/), and second [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/p4qaqf/and_thats_how_you_invalidate_your_service/).  
This is a spiritual sequel, as in it has nothing to do with the previous story, but the result is the same.

It's a nice and slow day, my site has a clutch of new hires on the job so our usual constant flow of calls is a little more relaxed, I've spent the day mostly on reddit, tbh. I'm doomscrolling through some news posts, when the call comes in. Caller's a low level cashier at one of our onsite contracted sites for #major-petrol-company#. Onsite means that if I can't fix the issue over the phone, we dispatch a tech. It's a pricey and yearly contracted service that only like 15% of our sites have, as opposed to ala carte calling a tech when needed which can cost upwards of $2,000 per visit.

After opening up the site's account and making sure I knew what equipment they had, I start getting more information as to what happened. Their register had frozen and the touchscreen wasn't responsive. Usually this is just a ""lets log into it and see what percentage of the HDD is full/check the utilized RAM/reboot"" problem, but the cashier decided to go all rambo.

The register has a side panel used for diagnostics, it has a status message, a soft and hard reboot button, some diagnostic switches, etc. [here's what it looks like.](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/857636929469415464/884971680030679050/unknown.png) As you can see, the hard reset button is recessed, the soft reset button is visible, easily pressed.. but like I said-- Rambo. The hard reset button is only for directed use under specific circumstances because it has a 5-20% chance of bricking the point of sale machine if used in the wrong status. I should also note that the panel that's open there is closed by a philips head screw and has to be manually opened, so it has to be intentionally accessed. They probably knew of it from previous calls with us where we often have them open the panel to give us the POS status message.

The cashier jabs a pen into the hard reset, and when it does nothing, unplugs the power, waits five seconds and plugs it back in. At this point, the POS screen is black, the status light is off completely, and the heartbeat is a solid red. That's when he calls us.

I let him know that there's a good chance this isn't going to be fixable without potentially reloading or maybe even replacing the unit, but I'll do what I can. I have him unplug the POS - it has a graceful shutdown process with a battery so unplugging it for 5 seconds does nothing. We keep it off for about 6-7 minutes, and it doesn't come back up when plugged back in.

I shoot a Teams message to a T3 with an update and he proclaims it bricked. I clarify the hard reset is considered 'attempted self repair' and he affirms this. That means not only is the POS dead, we're not going to dispatch a tech to fix it, because they've invalidated their own service agreement. I try to explain this to the cashier, but.. he doesn't get it.

Somehow he had the acumen to open a diagnostic panel, try to hard reboot, and then unplug and replug the POS (and mind you we have those little chinese finger-trap style locks on the DC power connector where you have to push in before pulling out), but not the basic understanding to get my explanation that his contract is invalidated.

In the end, I created a case in their account and gave him the case # to have his manager call in and get the explanation. The POS? Just another brick in the wall.",89,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0AC3460>
822,Why our tech support guy wasn't allowed to talk to customers any more.,"The year was long ago. It was my first IT job and I was working at a small national chain of computer stores. I was the assembler: every day I would build 8 custom PCs from scratch, load them and set them to burn. I had a good chuckle at the people who would be conned into buying the ""premium"" line which meant that for a few hundred dollars more your case had a strip of gold plastic trim on it. Other than that, same components right down to the motherboard.

Bill (or whatever his name was, that's good enough for the story) was the repair guy. People would bring their PCs in for service, repairs, cleaning some of the thickest coats of nicotine imaginable, removing the occasional dead mouse from the case, and yes, fixing broken cup holders (which really did happen). He was good at what he did, but was kind of short of patience.

One day a customer brought in his PC complaining that his CD was stuck in the computer and he couldn't get it out. Should be an easy fix. Bill took the computer to the bench where he promptly discovered that the customer had embarked on a fascination journey of discover upon which he learned that a CD is slightly larger than a 5 1/2"" floppy bay because the two have absolutely nothing to do with each other. However, he had been determined and used a rubber mallet to get his very first CD ever to fit in the slot which was tight because it was new and not broken in yet.

Bill was not particularly diplomatic in conveying his opinion of the customer's intelligence to said customer.

After that there was a new rule: if there was ever a customer who had done anything even slightly stupid, Bill was no longer allowed to speak with the customer but was to call me over the counter to deal with the situation.",79,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0AC34C0>
823,Now you are the story,"Prolog: Back in the 90s I had a small consulting group that fixed computers, created networks, etc.   One Wed a client called me saying they haven't been able to print since Friday.   I run over, ask them to print something (can I hear anything?) and check the cable from the PC to the printer.  All is fine there, then I look at the front of the HP printer; ""HP Load Letter""  (DOS days, WP 5.1)   I pulled the paper tray out and held out the two sides; ""you're out of paper""   Sort of understandable in the time, DOS/WP 5.1, since the software didn't tell the users.  But still kinda stupid to not check that.

Incident: A few years later I got a gig at a large bank.  I was the sol IT for this dept.  People would say to me when I came to help; ""I'm sorry, I'm just stupid."" and would generally just tell them; ""no, you're just ignorant of these things, that's ok, it's not your job.  That's why I'm here to help/fix these things, no worries.""  I would then tell them of the people who didn't even bother to check the printer paper.  (always made them feel better  ""at least I'm not THAT stupid""

Then after a couple of months my group got merged into a larger group in another build and now there was a ticket system (YAY!)  as well as other techs to help.  But now I had three buildings to cover.   Just as I was heading to another building a person came up to me absolutely frantic. ""I can't print, I need this NOW.""   I informed them that they HAVE to put in a ticket, it's not just me now.  Cue more yelling and freaking out.   So, sadly, I gave in... cause I knew it was going to be this easy. (Remember, we had just moved)  I walk into the room, reach down and pick up the power cord that wasn't plugged in and said; ""Remember those stories of stupid people, now you're one of them."" and dropped the plug on the floor and walked out.

A few months later I moved into a dev position and have only occasionally done support (to be a team player... always a mistake)  Those of you in support, you have my utter sympathy at the job. Best of luck.",10,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0AC3520>
824,"Sorry, your computer is not compatible with your desk","I was pimped out to supermegacorp, supporting a manufacturing complex (one big enough that they had rail tracks passing through the building so they could load product directly into the freight cars rain, shine or now). I got a call from the engineering annex, about a mile down the road from the main campus about a computer that was repeatedly crashing, throwing errors and generally being temperamental.

I get there and reproduce the error. Pull the computer off the engineer's desk and onto a convenient work surface, open it up, everything works fine so no pinched cables. Put it back on the desk  and the problems return.

Moved it to the adjacent desk thinking it might be something wrong with the outlet, works fine. Before moving it back I ran power into the outlet closest to the engineer with the problem, worked fine, so not the outlet.

After some more fiddling I started to pay attention to the desk itself: a nice top of the line stainless steel surface that might have been a drafting table at some point. An idea flashed into my head.

I took my multimeter and checked - 3V between the computer and the desk surface. Problem found.

I was in a building filled with mechanical and electrical engineers who knew exactly what to do and had the parts to do it. They grounded the desk to something (don't tell skilled trades, they'd be pissed if the electrician was cut out of a chance to make overtime) and everybody lived happily ever after.",64,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0AC3580>
825,You could have saved your job with a reboot!,"Long a time lurker, first-time poster. 

**HFF** \- Helpdesk Frequent Flier (one whose self-importance is drastically overestimated).

I work as an IT Manager for an international corporation and it never fails that we have a plethora of user issues with our staff and mobile workforce. Our organization has employees who are famous for not opening tickets and just calling out of the blue with the most basic of issues. Today is no exception! 

My morning started as usual with calls coming in before I or my team even arrive at work. We set to work answering calls and prioritizing the calls ensuring any production-stopping issues or customer-facing issues are taken care of first. 

Out of the blue (*and before my first cup of coffee*), our local HFF calls my direct line with an issue where her PDF reader will not open. I look into the ticket system as I do not remember seeing a ticket from her and sure enough there isn't one. Since I am already working on an issue that affects multiple facilities, I ask her to put in an IT ticket and I would address it as soon as I can.

Well as you can imagine the HFF gets irritated and demands I address her issue as it is urgent! Trying to be helpful I suggest that she give the system a restart and try again, ensuring it is not one of those odd occurrences that happen with certain operating systems. 

This is the point the HFF insists that she has already done so and it is still happening. She then again demands that I drop what I am doing and ""*help her*"". I politely repeat that I am working on an issue that affects multiple facilities and she would have to wait her turn. This goes over like a lead balloon and she disconnects the call after muttering sarcastically about the need of entering a ticket. *Please understand that ""opening a ticket is as simple as sending an email to the IT teams group inbox with a simple one-line statement of the issue. Our ticket system creates and fills in all other fields that are required automatically from the person's email address.* 

This is when I get a call from the HFF's manager demanding to know why I refuse to work on HFF's ticket. Now I am starting to get irritated at HFF since I had just asked her to do what requires minimal effort to get in the queue for assistance. Instead, she wants to get her manager involved as if it would help her ""jump the line"". Nope, I explain to HFF's manager I am working on an issue that affects multiple facilities and the HFF would have to wait her turn. HFF's manager understands and says that he will discuss the need for priorities with the HFF. 

Ten minutes later I notice a help request from HFF shows up in the ticket system. I quickly route the ticket to myself ensuring that none of my subordinates have to deal with HFF or her self-important attitude. I finish correcting the multiple facility issue and decide to take care of HFF's ticket.

I open our remote connection software to look at HFF's workstation event logs to see if there is any indication of what is causing her PDF software issue. Low and behold an update was applied to her software and her system was pending a restart. This is when I notice the uptime counter for the workstation at 3 days and 14 hours. I call HFF and ask her if she is still having the issue to which she sarcastically replies that she is. Since HFF has been difficult and known to exaggerate in the past (*bordering on insubordination*), I decide to call HFF's manager and ask him to be a ""*fly on the wall*"" during my conversation with HFF. He agrees and even suggests that HR be present.

Within the span of ten minutes, I had HFF's Manager and the VP of HR in my office explaining to me that this is not the first report of unprofessional attitude coming from HFF. To make matters worse I find out that HFF had just reported me to HR half an hour ago for being unprofessional. 

Keeping my composure I started the call with HFF. Immediately she gets irritated and asks if I have a solution for her issue. HFF uses some language that would never be acceptable in a professional workplace. Knowing that HFF has just crossed the line, I request that she refrain from using inappropriate language during the remainder of our call. Needless to say she not only does not stop using inappropriate language she actually increases using it.

I am asked to mute the phone by HR. I explain to HFF that I need a few min to ""*make a change on the back end of her system*"" which draws further toxic comments from her. I mute the phone and HR informs me that they will need a statement from me about the incident. I want to resolve the issue and get HFF off of the phone so I don't have to deal with this anymore. I return to the call and inform HFF that her workstation will need a restart to apply the changes. Well needless to say but her PDF issues do not exist after the reboot. 

And for one ""final nail in her coffin"", she closes the call with a comment of how useless our entire company is when it comes to resolving her issues. Within the hour HFF's Manager, HR, and I (*as the third manager in the room required by our termination policy*) were setting in the conference room where HFF's employment was terminated. HFF never said one word after she was informed that the company no longer needed her services and the details and reasoning for her termination. 

All I could think of during the exit interview was: This could have all been avoided if HFF would have just rebooted her workstation when I asked her to.",102,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0AC35E0>
826,"""It's URGENT!!! Unless you need something from me, then you won't hear back from me again""","This is probably more of a rant, but reading a Dilbert strip someone posted not too long ago reminded me of a quirk I'd like to share to see if I'm not alone.

Someone reached out to me on Teams for an ask. This is not unusual, as I work in systems support. What was unusual was that they included 4 other people to the chat as if this was some sort of emergency meeting of great importance.

$User: ""Hi, how are you?""

Now, my company is not huge, but it is owned by a bigger company I have no direct contact with. So, given how impersonal the initial message is, and the fact that I don't recognize any of the names in the chat, it takes me a while to realize they are addressing me personally. I just assumed I got added by mistake to a chat from Business Daddy and doesn't concern me. 

However, upon further inspection, I see the contacts have my company's domain, so I ask: 

$Me: ""Hi $User, are you talking to me? There are so many people in the chat, so I'm not sure.""

Turns out they do. They need help with the resolution of 2 images they have in a Word document, as it looks grainy, and that report is urgent as they need it for an important investors meeting. I reply: 

$Me: ""Sure, can you send an email to [support team]@[company name].com with the document in question?""

$User: ""$Lackey, can you provide $Me with that?""

$Lackey: ""I'll send the file shortly""

Now, does $Lackey email [support team]@[company name]? Of course not, he emails me directly and CC's every name under the sun. 

Sigh.... whatever, I do point that out, but who cares at this point. I check the file, there's nothing I can do with the images embedded, so I ask for the original images to see if I can insert them in a higher resolution.

It's been a week since and I haven't heard back from anyone... I guess that investors meeting wasn't that important.

Now, am I the only one who gets annoyed at managers dealing with tiny requests as if it was DefCon1, organizing meetings for things that can be addressed in an email? Is this how micromanagers act in the wild?

I'd like to point out that no one other than $User and $Lackey said anything in the chat. This could've been raised by $Lackey directly, but seeing how they couldn't even manage to send an email to the proper recipient, maybe I expect too much from them.

EDIT: I was reminded by u/codemagedon that DefCon 1 is the highest level of alert, while 5 is peace time.",259,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0AC3640>
827,The entitled accreditation board,"It's been several years, but I used to be a resident tech while I was in college (think front line tech support for students in the same dorm). A few of us also had shifts at the help desk (front line support for everyone else).

---

It just so happened that my senior year, our university was up for its 10 year reaccreditation. This means the university gets a week-long visit from the regional accreditation board (there are 6 such boards in the U.S.). Losing accreditation basically means the U.S. government no longer sees us as a real university, so this board has the power to ruin us. (On a completely unrelated tangent, the name of this board is *completely* ridiculous. Someone clearly didn't try pronouncing the acronym. This isn't the real name, but I assure you it's equally bad: Imagine having to discuss DIK-BOLS with your boss while keeping a straight face.)

So, naive little me assumes we'll simply have to be on our best behavior, maybe work some extra shifts just in case, and hold off on any upgrades or changes until they leave.

To my surprise, I showed up the Monday before their visit to find a stack of 12 brand new laptops at the help desk. My boss gave me a laundry list of things to do for each one. Being a small, public institution, this was *not* normal. You see, we had labs with machines over a decade old. That was when I realized how their visit would really go. This board *knows* they have the power to ruin us, and we must treat them like royalty.

So I spent most of the week leading up to their visit working my way through the laundry list on each laptop. Some of it was expected, like update Windows, install some software, pre-download some files, etc. I was a little surprised that they also wanted me to visit every website and open every PDF the board needed, on each laptop, just to be 100% sure there were no issues, but fair enough. The last step was the one I really remember, though: I was to carefully wipe my fingerprints off before placing each laptop back into its bag. Despite the fact that we had to prepare each one, they were to appear untouched by human hands.

Meanwhile, I texted one of my student tech coworkers (let's call him Rick) to ask what job they gave him.

> **Me:** So Rick, what do they have you doing?
>
> **Rick:** I'm at $nearby_hotel helping set up a temporary office.
>
> **Me:** Why at $nearby_hotel? Wouldn't it be better to do it somewhere on campus?
> 
> **Rick:** Oh, they are setting something up on campus too. But $nearby_hotel is where they are staying and it has a nicer conference room, so that is where their main workspace is going. You should see the snack bar they are setting up.
>
> **Me:** Take a picture for me!

It was a crazy week leading up to the visit, but it paid off. The visit itself was uneventful. Well, almost.

I was helping one of the full-time staff (let's call him Mike) clean up that same hotel conference room. That was where they left the laptops, so we were taking inventory when we realized we had one fewer bag than laptops. We couldn't find it anywhere, so Mike called the boss:

> **Mike:** Hey, I was wondering if anyone's found one of the laptop bags on campus? We have all of the laptops, but we're down a bag.
>
> **Boss:** No, did you ask the hotel if housekeeping found it in one of the rooms?
>
> **Mike:** Yes. They already cleaned them and didn't find it. They did say they'd let us know if it turns up, though.
>
> **Boss:** That's alright, it probably is on campus somewhere. Luckily, I don't think the board is at the airport yet, so I'll call their assistant and see if she can ask around.

Satisfied with that answer, Mike and I took a short break and munched on the board's leftover snacks.

> **Mike:** Hey, you see this one? La Cr...I don't even know how to pronounce it. Apparently someone on the board requested this special. I heard the catering department had to send someone an hour and a half away just to find it, and it looks like they only drank one or two cans!
>
> *This was several years ago, before La Croix was well-known nationally.*
>
> **Me:** Well it must be pretty good then. Let's give it a try!

We learned La Croix was not for us, but we did bring a couple back with us to show the rest of the help desk, where we learned what happened to the last bag.

> **Boss:** We found the laptop bag. One of them had it in their suitcase and said they must have packed it by mistake. I'm sorry to ask this, but Mike, do you mind taking the van to the airport to get it?
>
> *Note that this was a 3 hour drive, round-trip.*
>
> **Mike:** *sigh* Yeah I can do that. But wait...they *accidentally* packed it in their suitcase? How does that even happen?
>
> **Boss:** Believe me, I was wondering the same thing, but I wasn't going to ask questions. And of course, we're the ones who have to go get it. Thank you for making the drive, though.

And so ended two of the weirdest weeks of my time there. We passed our accreditation with flying colors. In fact, their assistant later told us it was the smoothest visit they'd had all year. The laptops became the crown jewels of our loaner pool. And the next Monday, I was back to telling parents that ""No, I cannot reset your son's/daughter's password for you, even if you know the last 4 digits of their social security number.""

Tl;dr Although they may be royalty, our loaner gear is not a gift to the accreditation board.

828,you need what? customer looses install media . . .,"This is another tale from ""awhile"" ago.  My company had sold a computer system to a military base about 4 hours driving from my main base.  No problem, I didn't have to visit often, maybe once or twice a year.

Then the customer needed the system relocated into a different building (your tax dollars at work).    I had to make a visit to inspect the new building, estimate the cost for moving, all that jazz.  Anyway, I managed this project and we got paid a lot to do it so everyone was happy.

Then Something Happened.   Several months after we did the relocation the system (System V Unix running a very small minicomputer) died.   Our help desk folks we able to figure out it was probably the hard drive (only one in this system), so they called me, we all figured out when I could get there, a replacement drive was shipped, all good.  I had an extensive conversation with the customer that we'd need their backup tapes (duh), plus the OS tape that came with the system, along with some extra tapes that had additional packages that we required.  I was assured they had everything.  They even had a safe that the kept all the tapes in.

I got up early next day and did the 4 hour drive, got to the new building, unboxed the new drive and had it installed in less than hour.  Hardware was not the most ""repair friendly"" design.  I then asked the customer for the tapes, they hand me a stack of their application backups.  OK, we'll need those later, where are tapes with the OS, the ones that came with the system?  Blank stares.  They check the safe, not there.  They had not unpacked all the boxes from moving into the new building so they start tearing into these.   I call the help desk, is there anything we can do?  Nope, need the tapes.

Customer spends a couple of hours digging through boxes, calling people who are not there and asking them, bickering about who's job it was to pack things up.  I'm kind of stuck, the disk installed is raw, no way to boot at all except off a tape (no floppy or optical on this system, your choice of scsi devices only, which you can select during the POST.

Finally the customer throws up their hands, they have no idea where the tapes are.  I'm on the phone with the support folks, what do we do?  Make them buy a new set?  How long will that take?  My support buddy finally just says he'll make a copy from tapes he has in the office, he knows which ones I need.  We don't know if we're allowed to do this, but we're in a jam.  I find out where the nearest airport is, a city an hour away.   He'll copy the tapes and get them on a plane to me.  I tell the customer what the deal is (they are really grateful), hop in my car and drive to the airport, find the air freight office, package has not arrived.  I take a seat and read a book.

At last, the plane lands, they hand me my package, I rip it open and confirm I have tapes!  My support buddy (great guy) has come through.   Back in my car and race back to the base.  Boot off the OS tape, hooray it works.  Have to actually partition the drive, entering various geometry  factors, then format it, then install the OS!  It works.  Reboot off the disk, all good, install optional software from the other tapes, various sysgen and reboots required.  Finally, re-install my company's application files, plus customer's database.  Now its way too late to drive home.

Spent the night in a motel and headed home the next day after checking in with the customer.  All good.   I don't know what we did about replacing the tapes, I didn't have to deal with that, I'm guessing we just let them keep the copies.",32,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0AC3700>
829,Can’t connect to Remote Desktop,"A few weeks ago was my turn to be on-call. Our current implementation is crap as calls don’t actually seem to be going to our phones like they should, so I have a habit of just manually checking my email and messenger throughout the day while I’m scheduled to be on-call.

That Sunday, I awoke and found an email from someone who called the support line saying that she couldn’t access the remote server because there was an error.

I called her immediately (the call took place about an hour before I checked when I woke up) and the user picked up the phone.

>Me: Hi, this is LittleWing from $CompanyIT returning your call for after hours support. Are you still having difficulty accessing the remote server?

>User: Yes I am, thanks for calling me back.

>Me: What seems to be the issue?

>User: There seems to be this error that won’t let me log in.

>Me: What does the error say?

>User: Hold on and let me try again.

I bring up the remote tool so I can remote in with her to view her screen. She accepts my invitation to share screen and I watch as she opens the Remote Desktop app and try to log in.

>User: See, that’s the error right there.

I start reading. Don’t remember the exact phrasing of the error, but it went along the lines of it not wanting to connect because it needed an update.

>Me: Okay, can you close that window for me?

Once the error window was closed, there was a light blue banner on the Remote Desktop window that said “Update to the latest version of Remote Desktop”.

>	Me: Do you see that blue banner? Have you tried clicking that and letting it update?

>User: Oh my goodness…I didn’t even see that.

User clicks the banner and Remote Desktop begins updating.

We wait about 2 minutes, at most, for it to finish.

>Me: Now can you please try to connect again?

User clicks to connect again and it lets her in.

I stay on just to verify that she’s connected and then end the call.",33,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0AC3760>
830,When they can't tell the difference,"I'm just your average guy and my dad needed some help. Of course I'd help.

The issue was, that his banking application disappeared from the taskbar. OK, not the first time he called me when something ""just vanished"" from the taskbar. I don't like working with that machine, because a toaster has more computing power. Opening anything makes that thing unresponsive for 30 seconds, but I'm just going to but it back quickly and nope.

The app was somehow bugged and wouldn't start and it didn't show up in Taskmanager. Nothing a quick PC restart won't fix. Yeah, that toaster isn't you latest rig, just restarting that piece of crap took about 3/4 hours. And Windows updates didn't sped up the process. And it didn't even help.

Now an hour had passed and I didn't make any progress. The old man had long since lost patience and started to watch his sports game, but unbeknown to me that did turn out into my favour. He stopped looking over my shoulder. After some more fruitless troubleshooting I made the decision to just reinstall the program.

&#x200B;

Uninstalled and rein, wait where are the original downloaded files, damn his download folder is empty. I go to the banks website and voilà there are only mobile app files and none for Windows. They discontinued their application for desktops.

I was out of options now... the original files are gone and I can't get new ones. So I had to gamble on my dads ineptitude.

I created a Chrome shortcut to the banks homepage and started praying.

My dad clicked the shortcut and the ""App"" started. He couldn't tell them apart",85,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0AC37C0>
831,I really didn't mean to do that,"I obtained my Certified Novell Adminstrator qualification for Novell Netware 3 way back when the servers booted into MS-DOS before loading Netware. I was the Systems Supervisor (job title) for the UK offices of a South Korean container shipping company. I worked out of the office in the port of Felixstowe, Suffolk. The network was a Novell 3.11 server (Intel 80386 with a whopping 1GB hard drive) that took care of about 45 workstations running MS-DOS/Windows for Workgroups 3.11 connected on coax cable runs.

About a year into the job and head office gifted us with an upgrade to Netware 4.1 (a CD install! No more swapping out of 25 3 inch floppies for an installation) and I was overjoyed. This network was going to be so easy to manage once the installation was completed.

As there was only the one server, I stayed late after everyone had signed out and left for the day. Step one - insert MS-DOS disk 1 and proceed to format the hard drive and install MS-DOS. Step two - insert CD containing Netware 4.1 and run setup.exe. Step three - configure the installation once Netware was installed.

Everything was going as planned. Network volumes set up, printers/print queues created, user login scripts and network shares created. Just have the users/usernames to create and I'll be done in no time.

Started creating usernames as the first letter of  first name and then last name. Then about half way through ran into a problem when several users had same last name and first letter if first name happened to be the same. Can't have this. What to do? I'll just use a different  naming protocol. That's what I'll do.

Started to delete each username individually, but then thought that's going to take more time to finish. I know! I'll just use the old wildcard '\*' so I won't have to fully type each username. Might as well start with the a's. Go into the user directory and type ""del a\*.\*"" and hit enter. As I did I suddenly remembered the user directory also contained the username for the system administrator, happens to be ""admin""! I just deleted the only way to manage/create/delete anything on the server. I had a fully functional Netware 4.1 server and absolutely no way to do anything with it.

Only recovery option available - insert MS-DOS disk 1 and reboot. Start all over again. I managed to get it all completed and running by the time day shift arrived the next morning.",80,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0AC3820>
832,"The Box is dead, long live the Box","We were  doing a server swap at work; a bunch of production systems going from one server to another, overnight. All hands are on deck at midnight, except your humble correspondent, because I'm not on the server team, I'm doing remote support.

I roll in at 8am to complete the one, important, task assigned to me: change the IP address on this legacy coms device so that it points at the new server, or else certain crucial systems will stop working. I did this six months ago during the first swap, it's not complicated. I find the beige metal box in the server room and note the outdated labels on it, notably ""Configured 8/5/2004."" The flickering LCD display tells me that it's processed 0 bytes of data since the last reboot six months ago.

Well, if it works it works, I guess. These things are important, someone would complain if they stopped working. A few minutes later I get an email that says they're not seeing the connection, have I completed the configuration? Well, I thought I did. I go back to the server room, double check, then triple check. Yep, all good. 

Server guys tell me to stand by for further instructions, so I wait a bit then get an email from the server team: “this system was switched over to (external solution provider) a few months ago, you can e-waste this device.”

833,Cat and mouse,"On mobile, apologies for any formatting issues. For context I’m an IT guy at a small company, and this story took place last year when my country first went into lockdown and users were adjusting to WFH.

A support ticket came in from a user I’ll call J, saying that their laptop trackpad must be broken as their cursor was moving about on its own. I gave them a call, and turns out the trackpad was fine, but that a wireless mouse was also connected and J’s cat was playing with it!

Easy fix and we both had a good laugh about it.",40,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0AC38E0>
834,Three truths and no lies,"So this is first post on this subreddit. These are all pretty old and a somewhat short, but painful nonetheless.

&#x200B;

So first one was maybe a year into me work help desk. I get the call and the user proceeds to tell me that she broke the cup holder off the computer. I started laughing as I have heard the myth. She goes ""why are you laughing I broke the cup holder and I need a new one?""

I realize that she was serious. She genuinely believed that the CD tray was a cup holder. It was on a cart and she had been using the tray to hold her coffee as she moved around.

I checked later and the tech had closed the ticket stating that she did actually snap the tray off completely. She was using a ceramic cup and put it down too hard and broke it. Obviously a new drive had to be installed.

About a year ago I ran into a consultant that had a user do that at one of his old places.  Seriously is this more common than I thought it was?

&#x200B;

Second story is in a similar vein. User calls about some issue. I tell her to take her mouse and move it across the screen to click on something. She tells me that now her mouse isn't working too. I ask a few questions and realize that she actually had taken the mouse and was trying to move the physical mouse on the screen. I had to explain to her that pointer on screen was also the mouse.

She admitted that she was confused why I asked her to put the mouse on the screen, but decided to just go with it. I guess it was just a lapse in judgement but it definitely worried me.

&#x200B;

The final one kills me to this day. So when I can in they were doing the xp to 7 upgrade. This is a massive company so literally thousands of computers.  It got stalled but they started it up again after I had started.

They apparently hired a consultant company on recommendation from one of the higher ups. They were not good. Computers not configured to connect to the network. No Programs installed at all or installed improperly. No printers be connected or installed with drivers for the wrong make/model. Devices not being set up for us to remote on to. They basically messed so often and badly  we always knew where they were working because we would get a flood of calls from those floors for all sorts of random issues we couldn't remote on to fix anything either, requiring desktop to come fix it.

Well I thought it couldn't get any worse until one day a user calls up and says ""Hey my printer is installed as a CD"". I thought they were confused because no one could mess up that bad right? Nope! It was one of the few PCs they actually did get the remote set up on. And yes the had somehow installed a printer on the computer as a CD drive. The drive was labeled as a printer and when they turned the printer off and on, the drive disappeared.

I called over my colleagues and they were just as shocked and horrified as I was. We also all thought it was hilarious as well. About 2 years ago I actually ran into another like that. I never thought I would run into another printer as a CD drive in my life.

And for those curious the higher up that recommended them, the issue was ""sorted out"" and ""dealt with"".",41,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0AC3940>

836,So is that a no?," Long time lurker, first time poster and on mobile.  Any grammatical, formatting or spelling mistakes are my fault as I’m a degenerate. On to the story. 

Lab employee: “Do y’all have toner cartridges that look like this?” 

And then shows me a toner cartridge I’ve never seen before. 

 Me: “I’ll go check“
 Me: “no I’m sorry we don’t and I’ve never seen a toner cartridge like that. Can I see the printer?”
 Employee: ”sure! Follow me!”

So I follow her down the short walk to the lab and she brings me to a printer who’s brand we don’t carry and I’ve never even heard of. 

 Employee: “when I try to print it just says ‘toner cartridge low’ and doesn’t let me print. Is there any way to bypass that?”

So I take a quick gander and there is not in fact any way to bypass it as I had suspected. Also the cartridge is bone dry so even if I could bypass it, it wouldn’t do any good. 

 Me: ”Let me go check the storage room just to be sure, but I really don’t think we have one.”

So I go check the storage room to see if we have Any and lo and behold we don’t. So I call my boss to be ABSOLUTELY sure. 

 Boss: ”What’s up?” 
 Me: ”I’m looking at this printer and I can’t find toner for it anywhere. Do we even carry this brand?”
 Boss: ”No we don’t. That’s one they purchased themselves without consulting IT to see if it’s supported so they’re on the hook for that one.”
 Me: ”Got it boss.”

So I walk back to the Lab to find the employee and break the news.

 Employee: “Oh I thought y’all would have one. Since y’all do tech and stuff.”
 Me: “Unfortunately since this was not approved by us we don’t keep cartridges for that model.”
 Employee: “… Oh I was asking because I didn’t want to have to go to Purchasing and have our department pay for it”
 Me: “Sorry but we don’t even use that brand of printer anywhere else so I can’t even try a different model number.”

We were like 5 seconds into the call, I barely understood who's on the phone, and she was already reading out this phone number at full speed, faster than I could type or even realize what this is. I told her to slow down and she explained that this number has been calling her work phone and she wants to know who this is and ""make them stop"" (her words lol). She obviously answered the phone, according to her no one was there / it hung up instantly. Yeah I can see how that is annoying.

That's all good, except for the fact that I have absolutely no system that could look this up, I don't even think this is possible for private individuals and companies without help from the ISP or some court order or something. She was just seriously overestimating our abilities and kept asking for the unknown callers name. 

I said if it's not one of ""ours"" (company provided mobile) I can't even find it and can't do anything with this random phone number. I can google it and hope it's known spam, ​look at the menues on the phone and walk her through blocking this number but no;

She kept interrupting me, demanded (!) I tell her who this is, so in her mind I just type this in and up comes the name and address of the caller.

The cast:

Jordan - FNG

Thomas - Me, the manager and network admin

Laura - An employee who's office was being rearranged

Sarah - One of Laura's coworkers

Sherry - FNG's mother, HR director

**DAY 34** - Up Close and Personal

A month in, and still Jordan haunted our waking hours.  In the intervening time since Episode 3 I had to discuss honesty and trust with him once again, after he failed a test that, due to sub rules, I shall not elaborate on other than to say it involves phishing.  Suffice to say I had grown more than weary of his presence, as had his coworkers.  Nevertheless, he was still an employee and I still had work that needed doing.  The work of the day was moving a PC for a user.

Jordan was sent to another floor to move a PC for a user whose office was being rearranged.  A simple enough task were it assigned to someone with more aptitude for, well, anything really.  During the process he had to call back down to our office for help hooking up the VOIP phone and her printer.  Alas, this tale is less about deficiencies in Jordan's technical acumen, and more about those in other areas.  Namely, how to be a functioning human.  This would become a theme over the next few months.

After moving the computer to the new area Jordan assured me that everything went smoothly.  Time would tell another story because shortly afterward Laura called me personally.  She asked a few questions about moving things around and making sure it wouldn't cause problems.  I explained that if she needed to move anything she could either just unplug them and move them herself to where she liked, or that we could come and assist.  She told me that she would take care of it herself, but expressed her frustration that Jordan had left her desk in a state of disarray, with cables strung across out in the open and nothing organized at all.  I told her that I would address the issue and she thanked me, but I could tell there was something else bothering her.

""Is that all you needed?  Is everything else alright?""

""No; it's fine.  He's just a little awkward I think"" 

""OK.  Anything in particular?""

""No; nothing to worry about.  I'll get this all sorted out.""

I wondered for a while at what had been bothering her when I got a call from Sarah, Laura's coworker.  Sarah was a straight-shooter with a sharp tongue.  She liked me and IT in general, and would sometimes bring snacks down to us for no other reason than that.  Sarah also had the pleasure of briefly having Jordan as an intern the summer prior to his hiring in our department.  She knew the score.

""Hey, Sarah.  What's up?""

""You're not going to like this.""

*sigh*

""Alright, shoot.""

""You know how Jordan was up here moving Laura's computer?""

""Yeah, she just called frustrated that he'd left everything a mess.  Said he was a little awkward, too.""

""He was more than awkward.""

""Oh?""

""Did she tell you that she hid from him?""

""What?!  No.""

""Look, she said he didn't do anything inappropriate, but he doesn't understand personal space very well.""

""Yeah, we've noticed that.""

""I'm sure you have.  He didn't get it when he worked for me either.  But whatever it was she told him that she had a meeting and then came to my office to hide from him until he was done.""

""Ah.  Well that's a problem.""

""I just wanted you to know.""

""I appreciate it.""

Well, I knew we'd have to have this conversation sooner or later.  The others and I had noticed Jordan didn't seem to understand the concept of personal space.  We'd call him over to show him something, and instead of standing off to the side to watch our screens he would hover directly behind us and lean over, inches from our shoulder and face.  When coughing or sneezing he wouldn't cover his mouth.  When talking to you he'd stand uncomfortably close.  Fixing this problem would take more tact than I could muster, and frankly I didn't want to deal with it.  Fixing this problem would require...

His mother.  

""Hi, Sherry.""

""Hey, Thomas!  How is Jordan doing?""

""Well, that's why I'm here.""

""Is something wrong?""

""Well... This is a little awkward and I'm not completely sure how to handle it to be honest.  There have been a couple complaints that Jordan doesn't seem to understand and respect personal space.""

I went on to relay the gist of the story above, with names redacted.  

""Is everything else going OK with him?""

""We did have one incident where he had a password written on a sticky note and when I asked him about it he falsely said that Daniel had told him to write it down.""

""Oh dear.""

""I had a frank conversation with him about honesty and trust.""

""OK.  Anything else?""

""The only other thing that comes to mind is a couple weeks ago he said he thought he could build a computer.  I gave him the parts he needed to make it happen and he needed a lot of help to get it together.  After it was done he'd made a mistake that kept the computer from working again.  It wasn't a big deal, since we were going to toss that one anyway, but after the fact - even knowing it wouldn't work again - he told us 'Well at least I got most of it right.'""

*laughing*  ""Oh, that does sound like him.  I'll talk to him about personal space later.  Thank you.""

Treated like any other employee, huh.  Sure.

840,Getting yelled at by my LT in Iraq for doing my Job,"A little background on me. I was an Indirect Fire Infantryman (mortarman) in the Army in the late 00's early 10's. I deployed to Iraq in 2008. At the time I was a the platoon RTO (**radio telephone operator)** / FDC (Fire Direction Computer). I was in charge of our radios and basically any technology in our platoon used. I had no formal training I was just learning on the fly. 

In Iraq, we were assigned some new vehicles called MRAPs. We had Strykers and Humvess back in Alaska but these were new. As such, I didn't know much about them other than how to drive them. One of my duties though was to change the comsec out of each of the radios as we needed. I knew changeover was coming and we were using our vehicles to travel back to the main base. I loaded up the vehicles that were known to me and went to the MRAP last. 

I went to fill the radios and all was good. However, I always did a radio check afterwards to make sure everything worked the way it should. I had hopped in the vehicle, disassembled what I needed to, and then reassembled the way it came apart. Or so I thought. When I conducted the radio check, I noticed that no matter what channel I put the internal comms on, it would only transmit on the top radio. Both Channel A and Channel B would only transmit on radio A. I couldn't figure out why. 

I informed the Staff Sergeant going on the convoy that I couldn't figure out what was going on. I could hear chatter from both radios but could only transmit on the one. He told me to speak with the commo guys and see if we could figure out the issue. 

When it came time for the convoy, I let my Platoon Leader know the issue and that if he wanted to speak on the other channel he'd have to manually change the frequency on the A radio to transmit or let one of the other trucks know to respond. He acknowledged and on we went. 

I was up in the turret manning a machine gun and noticed my PL getting more and more frustrated with having to change the frequency and messing with the radios. We then get to the main base and he calls me to the back of the truck. He proceeds to put me at attention and just lay into me. He basically said I had failed and that I endangered us all because I hadn't done the basic tasks of getting the radios filled and I could have caused the deaths of all of us because I was too lazy to do my job. Something to that affect. After about what felt like forever (probably more like 5 minutes) of being chewed out, that Staff Sergeant from earlier intervened and let him know it was a known issue and that I was to go to the Commo guys and troubleshoot. Which I was then dismissed and I sprinted to the commo shack to get out of there. 

After trouble shooting with the commo guy, we realized the MRAPs didn't have the same radio rack as the Humvees and couldn't transmit through the second radio without the B radio being plugged into a separate cord.  When I put the radios back together, I plugged that cord for the B radio into the A radio and that's why it looped. I felt really dumb and should have troubleshot that myself. 

My PL did apologize to me later for blowing up when he didn't know the whole story.",28,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0AC3B80>
841,Why do I even write documentation?,"This is more of a general rant than a story of a specific incident because this happens ALL THE DAMN TIME.

I'm a web developer who specializes with a particular CMS and would frequently get client requests to provide them with Excel reports of the data that's in their CMS for various things. Several years ago, after writing a few quick and easy but un-reusable export admin tools, I decided to make a reusable tool that could handle any and all of these export requests so that I would never have to write another custom export tool again. So I did, it took me several months and I've been refining and adding to it for the past 5 years. Thanks to my tool I actually was awarded with the CMS's MVP Technology Award and have been an MVP for the past four years now.

I made this tool as simple and user-friendly as possible so that any CMS user should be able to understand how to use it and be able to export data (that they have Read access to). Absolutely no technical skills required beyond what any CMS user already has. The tool itself has an explanation on every single field, but I also wrote out complete documentation on my personal blog for how to use it, which is linked to from the Github repo.

So then all my clients started using it and never asked me for data exports again!

Haha, just kidding. This is how it usually goes:

Client: We need to know all of the pages that have been created in the CMS under this folder. Can you provide us with this? (note: this is the most basic possible export)

Me: Hi client, you can use the export tool that I've told you about 12 times over the past 3 years to pull that information. Here's the link to the documentation (though you probably would realize you don't even need it if you just tried opening the export tool and looking at it)

Client: Thanks. Can we schedule a meeting so that you can explain to us how to use the tool? In the meantime, can you please generate the report for us?

Me: (to my project manager) Hi PM, you can use the export tool to generate that report they're asking for.

PM: Sure. I've never used it before though. Can you show me how it works?

......

Then eventually, several months or years later, the PM finally tries the tool (not the client though, they will never ever use it because it's easier for them to just ask us for all the data they need and wait up to 5 days to get it rather than spend 2 minutes getting it themselves). The PM messages me on slack: ""Oh wow, this tool is really useful!"". However, this only fills me with anger rather than joy because I KNOW IT'S USEFUL, THAT'S WHY I'VE BEEN TELLING YOU TO USE IT FOR THE PAST FIVE YEARS",69,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0AC3BE0>
842,Someone learned a new word,"Background: I grew up tinkering with computers. I have a degree in computer science, worked for years in network operations at an internet provider, and currently hold a communications director position with a large organization. I also have a large extended family, many of whom still think of me as a child.

Visiting some relatives over the holidays last year, and one of my aunts happened to be there. She owns her own somewhat successful small business. 

At one point, I am asked if I know anything about servers. Since I do, I replied in the affirmative. ""Oh good,"" she replies, ""can you help me set one up?""

I inquire (with some trepidation) as to what she might be trying to do. ""There are many kinds of servers,"" I explain, ""really a server is just a computer providing some type of service. There are web servers, email servers, file and database servers... what are you trying to do?""

""I need a server."" 

I suggested she speak with an IT firm. Quite literally could not pay me enough to continue that conversation.",195,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0AC3C40>
843,The Case of the Monitors not Working,"The people--

$MonitorMan - User that has been in 3 departments... Unsure why they are bouncing around.

$Me - DanuinKBH. Our intrepid hero. 

$MonitorMan calls up= ""The monitors are blank. They say something about no DV or something!

$Me - ""Is the PC powered on? ""

$Monitorman - ""It looks like it?"" Please notice the question mark. 

$Me - ""OK, move the mouse around, tap a couple of keys on the keyboard.""

$MonitorMan - ""The monitor just turned off!""

$Me - \*Thinking to myself\* OK...what the heck.. ""I'll be right over.""

I walk over to the office that is just down the hall. I see $MonitorMan in an office with 3 monitors spread out over the area, I realize this is one of the 3-Person offices. There is only one tower in the office, which is running, and working. I look at where he is sitting, I see a monitor. I don't see a laptop or PC, nor do I see a mouse and keyboard. I follow the monitor cabling and see there is no laptop or PC plugged in to it. 

$Me - \*Once again thinking to myself\* ""$Me, you dumbass, you didn't ask him to confirm that the cable was actually PLUGGED IN TO ANYTHING.""

$Me - ""$MonitorMan, there is no computer plugged in to this monitor. Nor is there a mouse and keyboard. For now, until we can get a new system deployed for you, you will need to use other $User's PC.""

$MonitorMan - ""Oh, ok. I thought the PC was controlling all the monitors and all I had to do was sit at the particular monitor and it would know.""

That was my NUMB moment of the week. We all know Users are always numb.",20,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0AC3CA0>
844,The Right Mouse Button?,"I work IT helpdesk at a university, and thought you guys might find this mildly entertaining, if not frustrating.

This time of year we get many requests for account resets, unlocks, and just general access assistance as students shake of the rust of summer and prepare for the semester. This particular university has a high percentage of older students as well(older being over 30). Students, particularly the older students, tend to call in very stressed over what is normally a very simple issue. Most of my job around this time is usually more focused on calming the user down enough to walk them through what they have to do to gain account access.

One call I received from an older gentleman went like this:

Me: You've reached (University help desk), how can I assist you today?

User: Your system isn't working.

Me: What seems to be the issue sir?

User: It won't go, it's not doing what its supposed to do!

Me: Ok, well.. what system are your working with?

User: I'm trying to access my account, but your system is sh*t!

Me: Ok, please provide me with your ID number, and I can take a look at the account.

I get the number, take a look at the account and nothing seems to be wrong.

Me: Sir, are you getting any error messages when you try to log in?

User: No it's just not going. You really need to come up with a better way of doing this.

Me: I understand sir, but lets focus on making sure you can get into the account for now. What happens when you try to log in?

User: You aren't listening to me, nothing happens, it just doesn't work.

Me: Ok. Walk me through it, step by step. You get to the landing page.

User: Yea.

Me: You see the sign in button?

User: Yea.

Me: Ok what happens when you click the sign in button?

User: Nothing! How many times do I have to say it?!

Me: Alright sir, well can you describe to me what you see on the page right now?

User: I just see 'Open link in new page, open link in new tab, save link as...'

Me(mentally): Facepalm. This can't be happening, this has to be a goddam nightmare.

Me(verbally): Sir, when you click on the sign in button, are you clicking the right mouse button or the left mouse button.

User: What the f*ck do you think? I'm clicking the right mouse button.

Me: Um... this is gonna sound weird, but do me a favor and try clicking the left mouse button.

User: Oh wow that worked, I can enter my credentials. You know, you guys really need to fix your goddam system, its really not very obvious what you need to do. Terrible service.

Me: You have a great day sir.

E: Formatting, hopefully I didn't make it worse. Thanks u/lloopy.",106,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0AC3D00>
845,In which the Obvious Matters (Two short tales),"So, I work Tier 1.5 for a US Government agency. In the three years I have been doing my job, I have gone from line soldier to being the back-up lead in my team. We have over two thousand people at my location, so we have a pretty good sized IT team with a pretty good support network. Herein, I have two stories- one of which is me beating my head on a wall for hours, the other of which is me pointing out the obvious. 

Story 1- 'Why is this happening?'

Story one begins when my manager is asked for support to look into an issue that two senior windows developers cannot solve. Whenever this user is trying to open VMware, it prompts for admin rights. Most of you TFTS guys are probably already saying ""aaah I know what that is.""

My manager taps me and one of the other top guns on the team to look at it, and I get my user in at around 1000 to start hammering her laptop. And oh boy, do I hammer it. I look at everything I think could be an issue. The windows developers give me a whole new version of the program to install for her. I verify it's an issue with her laptop (She can access the program just fine from another machine) and that something is fucky with the UAC on the machine. 

Three hours of troubleshooting later, including turning down my user's offer to wait while I went to lunch, I bring in one of my support guys. He's a brilliant chap, a quite literal autist who is ridiculously overqualified for his current level of work and knows more about computers than 90% of the folks in my org. He loves interesting problems and sinking his teeth into them. I'm on the horn with the guy when I say ""it's GOTTA be a compatibility issue on the laptop, we ran it just fine on something else.""

As I lit the spotlight to call down CAPTAIN OBVIOUS to the table, he right clicked the program, opened up compatibility, and said... ""Oh you're right. It's set to ask for admin rights every time.""

... All my whats. All my fucking whats. Three hours and it was a fucking checkbox that for some godawful reason ticked despite a standardized install. While the user was happy, I still want to bash my head into a wall for spending three hours for MISSING THE OBVIOUS. 

(Tale 2) On the off chance I'm wrong and this isn't normal for troubleshooting....

So we were working as normal when suddenly tickets for profiles started to come in. No access to personal profiles, no personal files, etc. Within a few minutes, I realized it was all coming from a specific server- If there is one thing I know I am good at it is troubleshooting and recognizing commonality of errors. So I rang the bell and yelled up the chain, and sure enough, everyone on this specific server was not able to get into their profile.

Mind you, this server hosted the *executives*, the bigwigs of my agency- as in, the Agency Head, and all the Chief Top Brass Sons of Bitches who were yelling down the phone as to why they were not able to get into their files.

An investigation by the top-line engineering team found some programs running on the server that were destroying the CPU usage and they rebooted it and fixed it... but profiles still were missing. After a half hour and god knows how much yelling, I decided to peek into the server. I'm still a line doggie, so I didn't know how much I could do. But when I logged in and looked at the server, I was greeted by none other than a server that had no user profiles on it. At all.

So I cautiously emailed the Engineering team (I assume everyone knows more than I do, which is the case often enough where I phrase everything carefully- My background is electronics maintenance, not IT) and said ""Hey, so... I assume this is part of troubleshooting work on your end, but the server is missing the user profiles folder- just wanted to say so in case that is not normal.""

Queue the Engineering Manager patting me on the head for seeing the obvious. He restored the folder, and the day was saved. 

Sometimes, you miss the obvious. Sometimes, you point it out. 

A day in the life of tech support.",22,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0AC3D60>
846,FNG fools them all PART 1,"On mobile etc etc.

FNG - New Guy

ME - me

Boss - Boss

SME - Subject matter expert


While in my noc days we supported not only clients but our internal staff. This included onboarding new staff and engineers. This was a small shop so engineers typically had admin rights to their machine so they were given a standard image and could customize it how they saw fit. 

In comes FNG. He’s one of our new Network/VOIP Engineers and Boss has been bragging about the guy being great. He did technical interviews with SME and got solid passes on them. He comes in for the obligatory face to face just to confirm he’s human but they already had an offer printed up. So first day in I hand him his shiny new laptop and ask him to get logged in so it will cache his creds and have him update his password. 

2 minutes go by

5 minutes…

10 minutes..

Me: “Hey FNG we’re you able to log in?”
FNG: “Naw it’s not workin.”  
Me: “Ok here’s local account let’s see if you are on the network. When it logs in give me the IP address you are getting.”
FNG: Logs in and sits there for 5 minutes
Me: “You got an IP address?”
FNG: “How do you get that again?”

I told him I would be back in a minute and go see Boss who I’ve known for almost a decade and repeat this conversation with him. He truly doesn’t believe me. 

End result was he didn’t know which port to plug the network cable into on his laptop. And he made double my salary. FML

In the next episode he tries to upgrade a voice router and all hell breaks loose.",24,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0AC3DC0>
847,That's not how this works. Bridges must be burned first.,"Back in the early 2000's I had a client that I did IT work for. Network setup, cable runs, printers and lots of software troubleshooting. At first I was hesitant to take them on since the owner was an estranged relative and giant red flags were already flying. You see unfortunately Owner had a reputation of having Lawyer on retainer and Owner kept him busy. Owner thought that scare tactics like litigation was a great way to handle anything he wanted. Owner was even known to have gone after his own children. So yea, Owner was a real peach so keeping him at arms reach was a requirement.

Me – Me

Owner – Estranged family member and all around peach.

New Guy – What ever IT person is in place

Lawyer – His lawyer of many years

So one day Owner tells me he wants a website for the company. Early on I did single page websites with just information so I could easily prepare a basic site. During this process I found out that a new salesman Owner hired dropped the idea in his ear and already had fliers and business cards printed up with the new website. One problem, Owner didn't own the domain name printed on the cards and fliers. This escalated when I found out that his Competitor actually purchased the domain name and created a website all about Competitors company. Lawyer is then invoked and using my imagination I hear legalese loudly shouted back and forth with Owner demanding that it belonged to him. I even consulted with Owner and Lawyer at this point informing them that Competitor bought the domain name first and Competitor can do what they want with it. Most of all there is a process of transferring domain names for security purposes and even if they win any lawsuit or Competitor gives it up, that transfer process still has to occur. 

In the end Owner didn't get the domain, but Competitor did take down the site. So I purchased a domain name that was very similar to the one Owner couldn't have and hosted his basic site. Over the years I did some updates to the site like staff changes (Including the fired sales person.), pictures and services. Things were quiet. I should mention that I purchased the domain name under my umbrella and hosted the site on my server. It was small and there was little to no traffic going to it, so my older web server could handle it. So IT work continues onsite for another year or two when suddenly my last two invoices are not paid. Inquiries made, but no word on what's going on. Then I get a letter in the mail from Owner and that my ""services were no longer needed"" and they wouldn't pay those invoices.

I wasn't really upset about this result. It felt more of dodging a bullet. Plus him not paying for work came as no surprise either. After a week or two I get a phone call.

New Guy – ""Hey this is New Guy. I'm taking care of IT for Owner Company. They told me to call you and get the passwords to the network WiFi, File Server and Admin Accounts."" 

Me - ""Oh really? Did they also mention that they have two open invoices and have officially refused to pay both?""

New Guy – ""No""

Me – ""I see. No surprise. Anyway all settings, configurations and other stuff are in an Admin Folder on the File Server.""

New Guy – ""What's the password?"" 

Me – "" Sorry, I can't help you. That bridge has been burned.""

Silence

Me - ""Oh there's a copy of their website on the File Server also. Once you start the transfer process with your domain provider you can request the domain name and I'll transfer it to you.""

New Guy – ""What?""

Me – ""Their website domain needs to be transferred and site host changed from mine to yours. Check with your provider about transferring domain name BlahBlah.net to you so we can start the process.""

New Guy – ""What website?"" 

Me – ""Oh boy. Well good luck and watch your back. C.Y.A. and document everything for the next guy.""

End call.

Never heard from him, so after about month I shutdown the site. Later on I renewed the domain name since I had a gut feeling. On a side note I also noticed that the original domain name Owner wanted was available. I thought about grabbing it but left it alone. Not my monkey, not my circus.

Fast forward about two years and the domain is up for renewal once again, which I cover, but decide to see if anyone was paying attention. So I created a simple page that said ""This domain name is for sale"" and to contact me via such and such email. Weeks later I get a message from a person via an unrelated work email. 

Unknown Person: “How much for the website? “

Hmm, interesting. 

Me – ""Selling it since it's costing me money and the client never requested a transfer. You may contact me at *work number* for more details."" 

No price given.

Next day I get a call from his lawyer.

Lawyer- ""My name is Lawyer representing Owner. You can't sell his website, he owns it. You need to give it to him.""

Me – ""I know who you are. That's not how this works.""  

Lawyer – ""You can't sell something that doesn't belong to you.""

Me – ""You didn't learn anything from the previous litigation you were involved with Owner and Competitor. I told you in great detail how this works.""

His tone suddenly changes.

Lawyer – ""You're the same person?""

Me – ""Yep and New Guy contacted me a long time ago but never started a transfer request for the domain name. I also had to explain the process to New Guy, just like with you and Owner years ago. Oh and by the way Owner has a full copy of the website on the server. Hopefully someone didn't delete it.""

Lawyer - ""Okay well go ahead and transfer the website over to Owner then.""

Here we go. Invoke lawyer speak.

Me - ""This is a two party process. The first party: Owner Company. Must request the domain name to be transferred online via Owners domain name provider, like say GoDaddy. That request reaches me via my provider and the process begins. I'm the second party. It's a bit technical but required for domain names to change hands. It's for security purposes so folks don't grab up someones domain name and use it like Competitor did. Once the transfer is complete, the website files can be moved to a new host.""

Lawyer – ""Okay so Owner just has to make the request and it goes to him?"" 

Me – ""It's a bit more complicated than that, but if current New Guy is available they can contact me and we can work out the details. The process just needs a starting point.""

Lawyer – ""Okay I'll let them know.""

Me – ""And just to let you know, a couple of years ago Owner decided not to pay for services rendered that I had to write off. While I'm not letting that factor into this situation you can let him know that is a bridge he burned."" 

Lawyer – ""What?""

Pause

Lawyer – ""Okay I'll get in contact with them today.""

Nothing happened afterwards. No request, emails, phone calls, nothing. Once the renewal came up again, I just let it expire. The family member that talked me into taking him on years ago retired soon after due to Owners behavior. Company passed to new management after Owner passed away and still exists today. They now have a nice little WordPress site on a new domain name.

848,Why is the WiFi beeping?,"Wait what?  
Anyways, I remembered a tale from a time past at the Complicated Computering Complex^(TM)

For background ^(radiation,) this company has a nuclear materials lab for training, testing, evaluation, experiments, etc. 

Cast & Crew:  
Radioactive Lady - Makes a confusing request, was not glowing  
$Steve - FNG that sleeps on the job now   
$Me - Maverick go-getter   

It's a slow day in the office, I'm reading up on the latest security threats, being responsible with VMware resources, wondering what new madness will befall upon us, the usual, etc. 

Ding! A ticket!

$RL - Why is the wifi beeping?   
It's rather annoying in the last training group we had..  
$Me - Wot?   
I had recently learned about coil whine, but these AP's are built to the most rigorous of industrial standards (Cisco) and after deploying 200 of them, they don't beep. 

Let's go have a look Steve! 

So we roll up in the fledermaus-mobile (oversized black golf-cart) and find out her lab is much harder to locate than previously thought. 

The important missing detail was going left past the snake pit and Steve nearly got bitten again

Anyways, we found it and $RL meets us and opens up the lab and BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

Being that my hearing is similar to that of a bat/dog, I am inundated with the high pitched screech of some instrument that is definitely not an AP. 

What's that thing?  
\*points to a shrieking yellow box\*

$RL - Oh, that's our other geiger counter and ope! it has a dead battery!  
\*click\*   
Silence deafens the room

Steve asks what samples they had on hand (I don't know why) 

After looking at him sideways after that question and then closing up the lab, we did see that the room acoustics of the lab + material storage & coat closet had the noise bouncing around which did sound like it was coming from above. 

So the concern for the newly minted NRRT (networking radioactive response team) was valid, but  the AP was outside the closet and visibly not beeping.",21,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0AC3E80>
849,Yet another FNG story,"I've been inspired the recent posts featuring FNGs, so here's yet another one.

Long ago I worked for a company that sold mini computers to various types of clients.  One application was sold to financial institutions and we had a proof of concept system installed at on very large such institution in a different city from our office, basically an hour plane ride plus maybe 30 minutes to drive from the airport to the customer.

We had been supporting this site remotely but we finally got some additional business in the area and were able to hire $FNG.   I was not involved in hiring $FNG but I found him super personable and seemed pretty sharp.  We sent him to our home office for a standard 2 week training course and then he was ready to go.  

One day the test system (the proof of concept system) went down and $FNG headed over.   He worked on it most of the day with numerous calls to our lead support guy in our office.  By the end of the day he was no further along so my boss told me to fly up the next morning.  $FNG had a set of spare parts so I didn't have to bring anything.

Next day I fly up, rent a car, and head to the site, $FNG meets me there.  We check in with the customer and start troubleshooting.  $FNG fills me in with great detail about all the things he did to troubleshoot, it sounds good but I'm a bit uneasy as it sounds like he really got a bit casual with swapping out parts.

The layout on theses minicomputers was three separate chassis, each one with various PCBs plugged into a backplane.  There were also some cables that connected some of the PCBs to each other and to outside devices.  Some of the PCBs were almost identical so it wasn't unknown to get some of the swapped with each other, but $FNG had assured our support guy that he had verified he had things correctly populated.  

I looked over the system and everything seemed correct at first glance.  I decided I would have to troubleshoot from step one, even though $FNG assured me that he had already performed the basic steps.  First thing I decided to do was simply re-seat all the PCBs since experience had shown that once in a while this was an easy fix.

I started from the top left chassis and popped the first PCB out, slid it back in, and stopped.  I did a double take and peered at the PCB.  It was one of the similar types and belonged in a different slot.  Quickly glanced thought all the PCBs, sure enough, several were in the wrong slot, clearly this was NOT the way the system had been configured before $FNG showed up.   

I quietly showed $FNG what was wrong and suggested we work through getting the PCBs back into their correct slots, which we did.  At one point our customer contact came by to check in, $FNG went into a total blast of technobabble, but delivered it in a completely believable manner.  I was crouched over the system listening in amazement, this guy could sell shoes to snakes.  

It took a short time to get the system back to the correct configuration and then we could actually diagnose the problem, which took another hour, I think.  $FNG was very appreciative, thanked me repeatedly, all was good.  

The next day I was back in the office and my boss and tech support guy reviewed the problem and how things had gone.   $FNG was a new guy so our expectation on his first system problem were not that great.  I was concerned that he had clearly messed things up worse than the original problem, and he had not been able to recognize it even with someone on the phone walking him through step by step.  My boss (who had hired him) was a bit shaken since he prided himself on doing great job interviews, but we decided to wait and see.

$FNG was around for a while and we had a few other cases of overlooking simple items, but he limped along, using his great people skills (he really did have a great people skills) to get by.   Eventually he left the company and went into sales, where I bet he was fantastic.",12,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0AC3EE0>
850,The case of the blank monitors...OR The wifi card that wasn't!,"So it's been a long time since I've posted on here. But I feel it's finally time to start my chronicles. Names have been changed to protect the identity of the stupid.

&#x200B;

It's a breezy day in the middle of autumn in a tropical paradise, perfect for jackets. I've made a great journey down to our HQ as I've been working remote for some time now for the most part but extra hands were needed at the time! I've settled into my old work area, various pieces of code and mathematics still scribbled on dry erase boards from years long past. The smell of dust, coffee and a breakfast burrito are flooding my senses as I log in to the help desk board.

&#x200B;

Just as I'm about to take the first bite of my food, I hear it, that dreaded sound. 

&#x200B;

The phone rings.

&#x200B;

**$*****HDM: Help desk, this is \[HDM\]. How can I- oh...uh-huh...***

&#x200B;

***$HDM: ...***

&#x200B;

**$*****HDM: O-... Ok. Let me put you on hold for a sec.***

&#x200B;

My heart slows to a crawl as does the world around me. I close my eyes, waiting as a feeling of dread flows down my spine. 

&#x200B;

***$HDM: Hey caffeine? Can you head over onsite to \[Client\]? $Witch can't get her monitors to turn on. And while you're there, the doctors' can't get one of the exam room workstations online.***

&#x200B;

**$*****Caffeine: Yea. I'll head over now.***

&#x200B;

I gave a longing look at my quickly chilling breakfast. One day, my love.

&#x200B;

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

&#x200B;

I've arrived onsite, but no one is happy to see me. Normally people are happy, excited or even upset when I arrive, knowing that I'll fix whatever issue they're having but the first thing that I see when I walked past the check in area was the dead, lifeless eyes, multiplied many times over as I make the treck into $Witch's office. An eerie quiet is ever present in this cursed building.

&#x200B;

Except for the squawking of $Witch.

&#x200B;

***$Witch: Why isn't my monitors working caffeine? This is just unacceptable! Why wasn't this fixed already, I've told you guys about it several times already.***

&#x200B;

**$*****caffeine: Oh, I'm not sure, $Witch. But I'll take a look right now. Do you by chance know the ticket number we gave you about the monitors?*** 

&#x200B;

***$Witch: I don't have one. But I told $CSM about it last time he was out here.*** 

&#x200B;

**$*****caffeine: Then you should have a ticket about it. We can't keep track of things if those arn't created. That's why you need to followup with a help desk ticket.*** 

&#x200B;

I chuckle internally. $Witch only checks her ancient, decrypted POP3 AOL-era email once a day as it is. Hell freezes over each time she uses her email to send tickets. Snippy remarks aside, I've finally managed to move around her tiny desk and around all the papers to get to her monitors, both of which are lit up with a blue power button, signaling the monitors are getting signal from the workstation. I can hear the fan running at ludicrous speed under her desk as well, no doubt from all the papers and lack of airflow down there. Hmm....

&#x200B;

I made my way over to her mouse and keyboard and wiggle the mouse, which suddenly appears on screen, but the with the black screen. Huh. My first thoughts drifting to user profile corruption or an ancient curse has finally been placed on $Witch. Either wouldn't surprise me. I tried pulling up the task manager with keyboard shortcuts and found I was able to do with no issue, but what did surprise me was that I saw ""Windows Photo Viewer"" in the task manager. No. It couldn't be that simple. But sure enough, her desktop sprung to life, icons and all when I ended that task. Neato. 

&#x200B;

**$*****Caffeine: $Witch, you had two empty pictures on full screen mode. Any idea why?*** 

&#x200B;

***$Witch: Oh well I thought if I did that, I could save some money since you said not to turn anything off while backups are running.*** 

&#x200B;

Ah. So, in an effort to save money on utilities, $Witch has all workstations turned off at the end of the day, making updates a PITA. I told her not to turn hers off every other wens day for backup purposes. I explained that she could turn her monitors off and then asked about the exam room workstations not working. 

&#x200B;

I get pointed to the right one and seeing as no one's in there I poke in and take a look.

&#x200B;

All the workstations in the exam rooms are using old wireless G adapters and frequently forget the SSID so, I'm hoping this is the issue. However, it becomes very apparent that something is very, very wrong. The internet icon has a red x on it. At a glance I could tell the adapter is missing! Dear god the horror!

&#x200B;

**$Caffeine, poking head out of exam room: Hey does anyone know what happened to the little usb device that was plugged into the workstation.**

851,Where is the laptop,"  Some background - I use to work help desk support remotely for a big pizza company when I was in college. Really it just required me to be on the phone all day and do basic trouble shooting.

One day the phone rings and I pick up. 

A user was asking for the password to a laptop my company gives out to all their employees. I told the user the password should be their email password. They replied back that it wasn't their laptop it was one of their student's and they found the phone number under the computer. 

My follow up question was where the student in question was. In my mind I thought maybe the company recycles old laptops or sold them off. The teacher responded that the student was in a school district located 10 states away from the company. I asked them to read me off the serial number on the back of the laptop so I could report it to my supervisor and see if it was still active.

There have been a few cases within the company of computers being stolen from company employees - and if this was the case, we needed to lock the computer ASAP. I kept the teacher on the phone and thanked them for their patience and I pinged my supervisor. My supervisor was able to pull a name that the laptop was assigned to and noted the laptop was still active. 

I wrote down the teacher's phone number and name and noted I would have to call them back. This was done because Teams and the phone software we use works horribly together. I hung up the phone and called the owner of the company laptop on Teams. 

I asked two basic questions: 'Do you know where your laptop is, and do you have a child who goes to xxx school' 

Their response was a mixture of laugher and relief, stating that the child's father mixed up the laptops and that they would have to call the teacher now. I told my supervisor the computer was not stolen and that ended there.",19,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0AC3FA0>
852,In Which the FNG Manufactures the Very Rope With Which to Hang Himself,"Shameless as I am, I will be jumping on this FNG bandwagon. This is a story from way back in the day; as usual, *everything* has been changed to protect the innocent--the guilty get a free ride on their behalf.

----

$Company is in the middle of an unexpected growth spurt and everyone is playing catch-up. In addition, we have closed a lease on a nearby property that will allow the corporate folks to move out of the retail space. In a rare case of forethought, the suits decide to bring on some of the new hire technical trainers early so that they can lend a hand with the expansion and move. One of these hires has rack-and-stack / structured cabling experience along with several IT certifications, and so is given the task of setting up a new training room.

The details of these plans are made without my involvement, I'm just aware that people will be starting early to help with the build-out.

So $FNG, along with a few other trainers, arrive on their first day and are introduced. $FNG and I hit it off especially well as we have some shared experience to bond over and he's generally an easy-going, personable guy. Over the next few days, we spend a few minutes bullshitting when we meet each other in the halls, generally doing that new-coworker-friend dance.

In the middle of $FNG's second week, he stops by my desk and asks for some help:

> **$FNG**: Hey, $Me, can you give me a hand setting up this training room? It's kind of a last-minute thing and I'm not sure I'll have enough time to get it done.

> **$Me**: [laughing] Isn't that just the $company way--months of planning this move and no one thinks to plan the network side! Let me finish up a few things here and I'll meet you in the room.

> **$FNG**: Awesome, thanks!

Most of my important work is all waiting on other people at the moment, so I can actually spare a half-day or so without any real consequences. We're also still a pretty small company at that point and we're all used to doing the odd-job or banding together on projects. About an hour later, I walk over to see what's still left to do:

> **$Me**: Hey, $FNG, I figured we could get an idea of what's left and then do some planning over lunch, this afternoon we can come back and crush...

> **$Me**: What are all these boxes?

> **$FNG**: Those are the workstations.

> **$Me**: ...and these?

> **$FNG**: those are keyboards and mice, and the switch is over here, and this box has all the network cables.

> **$Me**: So in the hour since you've talked to me you have...

> **$FNG**: I organized all the boxes.

> **$Me**: Ok... How many workstations?

> **$FNG**: I don't know... [counts boxes] looks like 30 towers.

> **$Me**: And when does this need to be done by?

> **$FNG**: They want to do a trial run tomorrow.

> **$Me**: Tomorrow! You got one day for this?

> **$FNG**: Yeah.

> **$Me**: Well... I guess we should get started. You start unboxing workstations, 30 towers on five rows of two tables is three per table, got it? I'll unbox the peripherals and set them out.

We get to work. Honestly, it's not really all that much work, even for one guy and half a day, but I know how these things can go wrong in a hurry. Sure enough, while someone ordered workstation patch cables, they were all 3'--not nearly long enough for 2/3 of the workstations to reach the ports on the walls. $CTO says he will take care of it and we'll have cables in the morning.

Meanwhile, we knock out the rest of the work, chatting about certifications while we do. He went to a technical school that encouraged certification while I was self-taught at the time. We get the room finished up early the next morning and the trainers are happy despite the delay.

----

At the time my desk was in a bullpen-style area at the end of a hall that contained a mini-bar we used for coffee and employee snacks. The way the hall and the room intersected caused two things:

* People frequently socialized with those in the room while stopping by to make coffee or get a drink. The bar was inset just a little, so if you leaned against the counter just outside the room you weren't blocking the hallway but were still within earshot of everyone in the room.

* From the mini bar, you could see almost all of the room--almost all, except for the near corners where two desks were located. Veteran employees were in the habit of poking their head in when arriving to see if those desks were occupied--a frequent joke was how someone would ask if we knew where $A was, while $A was sitting just out of sight--but the new hires hadn't learned this trick yet.

So a few days later, $FNG stops by to thank me.

> **$FNG**: Hey, $Me, I just wanted to thank you for your help last week.

> **$Me**: No problem, we're a pretty laid-back group here; happy to help out when needed. Glad we were able to get it done that quickly, even with the cable issue.

> **$FNG**: Yeah, I couldn't have done it without your help.

> **$Me**: Again, no worries.

> **$FNG**: Also, I wanted to tell you that I'm thinking of studying for my CCNA, maybe we'll work together in the future.

> **$Me**: Well, I'm sure we'll work together regardless in the near future, but that's good to hear. You'll have to tell me how it goes.

$FNG heads back with his $Era-Equivalent-Monster-Drink to whatever he was doing. Unbeknownst to him, $CTO had been sitting at exactly one of those hidden desks working with another employee and had heard the entire exchange. After $FNG leaves, $CTO wheels his chair over next to mine and starts an enlightening conversation:

> **$CTO**: You helped $FNG set up the training room?

> **$Me**: Yeah... remember when I came to you about the cables?

> **$CTO**: Sure, but I thought $FNG just asked you about the issue and you came to me--not that you were helping with the actual setup. When did he ask you for help?

> **$Me**: $Date mid-morning. We knocked most of it out that afternoon.

> **$CTO**: And how do you like $FNG, think he'll work out?

> **$Me**: He's a nice enough person. We won't be at each other's weddings, but we might get a few beers sometime. Little rusty on the hardware side, but I guess he's a trainer, not a tech.

> **$CTO**: Yes... good to know. Excuse me, I have to take care of something.

> **$Me**: Ciao!

I knew something was up but didn't get the whole story until a day or so later.

Turns out, $FNG had that entire week to get the room set up. Or rather, his only two tasks were to review the training material he'd been teaching, and set up the room--and only the room had a hard deadline. So he had seemingly wasted the first three days and had to enlist help when only a few hours were left before the deadline. That was concerning, but the kicker was that $FNG had not only ""CCNA"" proudly listed on his resume, but ""CCNP--active"" as well (which, at the time, was a certification you could not get without having passed the CCNA).

So $FNG had unknowingly, not only confessed to bad time management in front of his ultimate supervisor, but he had also confessed to not having a certification he claimed to possess in front of the very person who interviewed him. $CFO called $FNG into his office that afternoon and asked him to provide proof of his certifications. At that point, $FNG knew the jig was up and confessed everything. Turns out, most of his resume--all of the technical experience--was forged. He was let go immediately.

Ironically, we were a pretty laid-back team at the time, and none of those certifications or experience were essential qualifications for the job. While he would have been a less attractive candidate with an honest resume, there would still have been a reasonable chance of landing the job.",32,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0AC4040>
853,"My first day at new company, I made a good impression!","
A bit of background here. I have worked in support/maintenance roles my entire working life, I don't do management so have been happy not to get promoted. Hence I was probably a good ten years older than my work colleagues. But this has advantages. I fix rather than replace, I know how to use a soldering iron! Anyway, back to the story.

It was my first day and my new boss was showing me round the building and introducing me. We went into the server room and three of my new colleagues are standing in front of a screen scratching their heads. There is an error message on the screen:
KEYBOARD NOT FOUND PRESS ANY KEY TO CONTINUE
The keyboard is definitely plugged in.
They tried a different keyboard, no change.
They were talking about having to buy a new motherboard and this was an expensive piece of kit, board several hundred pounds at least.

I immediately had an idea as to what might be wrong, so I asked if I could take it to their well equipped workshop and take a look. The guys were quite surprised but agreed anyway as they had nothing to lose.

I took to to the workshop and got the lid off, had a look inside. Sure enough there was a tiny ceramic fuse right next to the keyboard socket. I had read in a computer magazine only a few days previously that these can blow if you hot plug or unplug the keyboard. I soldered a small wire bridge across the fuse and hey presto! Server working again. I took it back in triumph to gasps of amazement from everybody.

 I explained what I had done (without mentioning I had read it in a magazine of course) and told than not to hot plug keyboards. So, immediate God status from whole IT department (and more importantly my new manager, especially as I had saved him the cost of a new motherboard!)",96,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0AC40A0>
854,You may have a law degree but you're still an idiot. || Part 1,"Before we start, some context. I work as a SysAdmin for a medium sized law firm. (Read: I'm the only IT person for a law firm of about 100~ people) As such I handle *basically* every issue for pretty much anything that plugs into a wall. I wear every hat from Tier 1 Help Desk to CTO most days.

To set the stage for the type of environment this is, and the type of people I support. The law firm was founded by a single lawyer in the mid 80s, and eventually grew to be one of the largest (for our specific type of law) in our state. But the entire operation is still running in exceptionally legacy software (think like, it was written in 1992 and hasn't been updated since) the company that wrote it was acquired by another company in 1995 which was acquired by another, and another, and so on, I think we're 4 or 5 companies at the current point in time. Contacting their support and trying to get anything fixed other than surface level settings is an exercise in futility. 

Also the previous firm founder passed away and the firm was sold to a different set of lawyers that owned their own firm. As such these new owners are coming in, investing a ton of money to modernize all the IT systems (thank god), but as a result we're in the middle of 6, possibly 7 different migrations including our main ERP and CRMs, our phone system, fax system, and email. (Relevant later)

I have dozens of stories like this (as well as more involved ones) to share after some time working here that is finally coming to an end later this year. And that I hope to be able to find time to share all of them in the coming weeks.

What about the type of people I support that I mentioned above but didn't elaborate on? I'm glad you asked, that's where this story starts. You see, lawyers are second only to doctors in attitude and entitlement (most days, and to be fair, not all of them, most of them are incredibly nice people, but alas, those ones do not make for the good storytelling). Most of them have what I call a ""learned helplessness."" 

This story starts by one of our attorneys, lets call him Richard, commanding one of his paralegal assistants, to come find me. Now, it should be known that I work remotely more than I'm actually in office (I work a hybrid schedule right now, 3 out, 2 in, leaving for full remote at the end of the year bless up). As such, users do not typically just walk up to me/my office for issues. They will call my extension, email me, or call my cell phone. 

Anyways, she appears at my door, quietly knocks and informs me that Richard has told her to tell me that I ""urgently need to fix his printer as his printer has disappeared entirely from Windows and he needs to print this demand for X client where our fee is going to be Y amount and this is costing us money."" You guys know the self indulgent spiel that users with an inflated sense of self tend to give.

So of course, I drop everything I'm currently doing (remember those migrations), and walk over to his office. First thing I do is open the Printers and Scanners panel in Windows, not only do all 3 of our managed MFPs show up, but his desk printer does too. And right next to the label that says ""RICHARD'S DESK PRINTER"" is another little label. This one however says something different, it says ""Offline"".

I notice this and look to my right at the physical printer. I notice there's no LED lit up on the power button. I press the power button, the printer instantly whirrs to life and starts spitting out whatever he tried to print 2 minutes ago. 

I proceed to not say anything and walk out of his office.


And that is why, just because you have a law degree, doesn't mean you're not an idiot.",69,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0AC4100>
855,"FNG finally gets fired, but goes out in the worst way he could have","Been lurking here for a few years, and while this story isn't really tech-support or anything like that, u/iammandalore's stories of his FNG made me want to post about the new guy we just recently lost due to him being inept, lazy, and/or just didn't care. Probably not the most entertaining story, but how could someone be this stupid?

Background: I work for an IT contracting company, and the contract I'm on is as a Service Desk tech at a hospital. My boss works for the same company I do, and he reports to the hospital's CIO. 

After some schedule changes, somebody quit, more schedule changes, and new people were hired and trained. I got moved into M-F 2nd shift after having been on M-F 2nd shift then 3rd shift on weekends. This is about the guy who took the shitty hybrid schedule I just left. Well, mostly about the event that caused him to be fired. 

Prior to this final event, he rarely responded to any communication directed at him regardless of importance. There was one night we were working together where I had to go off-site to image some computers, and hadn't heard a word from him all shift. He wasn't answering calls, texts, messages in Webex, nothing. It took multiple calls from bosses to get him to acknowledge anything.

When I did see him in person, he barely spoke a word to me unless he was on a call and needed help, which he needed. Frequently. Myself and other coworkers have had to coach him through some of the simplest things we do multiple times. He also regularly neglected the very few tasks he had on those night shifts, and I've gotten too many calls from users who were speaking with him and said that the call dropped suspiciously while he was working with them. Toward the end he seemed to be getting better, but man was he not at all. We all knew he was going to be fired at some point, but were just waiting for the when and why.

&#x200B;

This is the when and why that I've been told from my boss and a coworker.

I heard this from my boss after I got up Monday morning, and this happened around midnight on Sunday night, during my now-former coworker's night shift. Found out later from another coworker that it was about an hour into his shift, as she was called in to take over at around 1AM.

According to my boss, the ~~dude~~ idiot was sleeping on a couch, wrapped up in a blanket with his shoes off and his laptop on his stomach. He didn't even go somewhere to try and hide, just in plain sight in a doctor's lounge where anyone could have found him.

And he was found. By a security guard and the on-duty nurse supervisor.

When they confronted him, he got argumentative to the point where they had to call the police to escort him out of the building. Security took his badge, and then he had the testicular fortitude to sneak back in. When he was found again, they had to have the police escort him out a second time, and he was drunk. He might have been drunk the whole time, but I'm putting this together from multiple sources so who knows. That series of events over the course of an hour or so was the final straw, after many of his fuck ups. It wasn't my boss who fired him either. It was the hospital's CIO. At around 1AM on a Monday morning.

Funny thing is that apparently when he was interviewed for the position, he did very well. In practice though, he was barely good enough to just answer phone calls. Found out after his first few fuck-ups that he was going through some really rough life stuff, causing me to think ""why the hell would you do this when you need the job?""

Whatever the reason, good riddance and thanks for the overtime.

TLDR; now-former coworker already on his last chance gets drunk and argumentative to Security when caught sleeping, gets kicked out of the building twice, then fired by the CIO.",100,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0AC4160>
856,The New Guy Chronicles - Episode 3: Mr. Confident,"These are the stories of the New Guy. All of what you are about to read is true. I write you these tales of mirth and woe, of entertainment and anger with as much accuracy and as little embellishment as I can manage. Many conversations are written as best I can remember them from my notes and memories about the incidents they describe, but the heart of what you are about to read is as true as I can make it.

Names have been changed to protect the innocent. And the guilty.

[Episode 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/pemwdf/the_new_guy_chronicles_episode_2_the_betrayal/)

The cast:

 - Jordan - FNG
 - Thomas - Me, the manager and network admin
 - John - The older of my two other reports, primarily responsible for server maintenance, major application upgrades, and supporting our smaller off-site locations and their specific applications
 - Daniel - The younger of my two original employees, though here for the same amount of time as John. Both longer than me, actually. Desktop and server support, document management and phone system support, phenomenal people skills.

**DAY 10.2** - Mr. Confident

Along with the fetid stench of betrayal, day 10 reeked with another more subtle odor: misplaced confidence.  Jordan had stated - with the confidence that only ineptitude can supply - that he believed he'd done enough studying (read: watching youtube ""training"" videos) that he could build a computer.  Smirking quietly to myself, I set out to test his theory.

I found an old computer and monitor slated for disposal, and in a back room I ensured that it booted correctly.  I then disassembled it, removing the RAM, video card, memory, CPU, power supply, disk drive, and hard drive.  I gathered these parts and laid them out on our bench.  Upon seeing the smorgasbord of circuitry, Jordan's interest was piqued. 

""What's all this?""

""You said that you thought you could build a computer.  Well, Mr. Confident, here you go.  Put this one back together.""

He began the assembly, and straight away I could tell that failure was certain.  During the process he required assistance getting the disk drive, PSU, and CPU/heatsink mounted.  All of this help was provided only after he asked.  Upon pressing the power button for the first time after ""fully assembled"", the angry pixies failed to chooch, and nothing happened.  Minutes passed in silence before the inevitable happened.

""I'm not sure why it won't turn on.""

""You forgot to plug in the power connectors for the motherboard and CPU.""

""Oh!  OK.""

Attempt number two, alas, was to fare little better.  This time the attempt produced a series of beeps, and again Jordan's befuddlement was clear to all spectators.  

""It's powering on, but it's not booting correctly.""

Harkening back to a conversation we'd had only a couple days prior, in which I'd explained beep codes and error lights commonly found on computers, I opted to give him only a slight nudge.

""You have all the information you need to diagnose the problem.""

""Everything is plugged in I think,"" he said after a few minutes.

""*The computer is giving you* all the information you need.""

Reminiscent of Red Leader in the trench run on the first Death Star, my hint again missed the mark and just impacted on the surface.

""The beep codes, Jordan.""

""Oh, right.""

After looking up the beep code we discovered it was a memory error due to the RAM not being fully seated.  Similarly, video output was garbled upon the next boot which we resolved by seating the video card fully.  Next was the hard drive, plugged into an inactive SATA port.  Finally, with everything properly in its place and seated, the moment of truth.  Jordan, putting one foot in front of the other and confidently striding past his previous failures, pressed the power button for the final time.  His giddiness at his imminent success was palpable.  

It would be short-lived.  The machine would POST, surprisingly, but not boot.

""I don't understand.  Everything is installed correctly now, right?""

""Yes.  But you made a mistake earlier that makes it all irrelevant.  Unplug it and remove the heatsink and CPU.""

He did as told, and the evidence of his crimes against machine-kind were laid bare.  

""You see that?""

""Yeah...  What is it?""

""Those are bent pins smeared with thermal compound from when you tried to install the CPU upside-down.""

""Is there any way to fix it?""

""No.  Not unless you think you can scrub away all that thermal compound and bend those hundreds of pins back into the precise shape they should be in.  You're lucky this computer is one we were throwing away anyway.  It's ruined unless we want to just replace the motherboard.""

""Oh.  Well at least I got most of it right.""

Ah.  To live in such blissful ignorance of one's own incapacity.

857,Apparently projectors have a freeze button,"I don’t know if I deserve to post here,I don’t work tech support, I’m just a computer science major, that wants to learn more about computers and stuff so I try to help where I can, I also recently rebirthed an old computer (of mine) with Linux, I’m not great at this stuff, but hey the way to improve is practice

So the projector was frozen on the first side of a power point

I start by assuming the projector is a second monitors, I’ve had minor issues with a second monitor on the past, turns out the projector has the same signal, so they are both the same monitor, kind of like how two keyboards are treated

I then tried to check the physical connections, and I thought I found the issue, there was a big wire that just wasn’t plugged in, I tried to figure out what it was, and asked the professor eventually (couldn’t at first, she was talking to the class while I was fixing it) as it turns out she has never seen that wire before, so I looked around, I then noticed it was plugged into something with a tag that says “laptop” which has a switch turned to “desktop” and a desktop is plugged in

Turns out that’s incase you want a laptop to be plugged in, but you don’t have to unplug the main computer (teachers often teach in different rooms, so maybe it’s so they can avoid messing with a cool-workers set up)

So I decided to check the projector settings, grab the remote, and then just start cracking up
Right below the main controls, I’m an easy place to accidentally press there’s a big button that says “freeze”

I press it, and suddenly it works

I just continue laughing, and just show three teacher/class that there was a freeze button, one or two laugh a small amount,I was probably the only person am really found it funny (I was also the only one who spent 30 minutes on the problem)

858,“CBS randomly mutes itself”,"In addition to my professional career, I’m the family technician especially to my grandmother’s boyfriend. Feels like every time I come here, he’s calling me over to help him with something.

I come by once a week to do laundry and hang out with my grandmother and tonight was that night. My grandmother’s boyfriend, Hank, calls me into the other room where it’s *super* warm, like I’m sweating in seconds of walking in, to ask me for tech support tonight.

>Hank: Can you check out the TV? Like reboot it or something? Channel 2 CBS is always going mute randomly and now it’s spreading to other rooms.

I agree rebooting sounds like a good start so I unplug all of the fairly hot cable boxes around the house and leave them unplugged for a good 30 or so minutes while I talk with my grandmother.

I come back and plug in everything and they get to watching all these awful shows like Young Sheldon and whatever else was on while I browse Reddit and play mobile games. But I peek my head up every so often and start to notice what Hank was talking about. Randomly throughout commercial breaks, mostly, the sound just goes dead silent. Pretty wonderful to me, but I could understand this was *their* entertainment.

Then I started noticing that throughout all of these shows…there was this really weird narration. I thought it was a strange move by CBS to have so many shows from comedy to drama have this woman in the background describing what’s going on in each episode. Maybe their new trademark?

Then I started picking up on it during NCIS when it was clearly out of place and realize this is definitely not CBS’ doing.

I asked Hank for the remote and checked the Accessibility settings and saw someone enabled some setting for narration that was only showing on CBS, not on any other channel we were watching. Disabled that setting and so far over the last few hours, all is good again.

This isn’t uncommon at my grandmother’s house. Someone is always enabling some weird setting on the TV and everyone just puts up with it until I come around.",232,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0AC4280>
859,A case of impeccable timing,"I'm a full stack web dev, mostly working on developing and maintaining eCommerce sites using my company's in-house platform. We do support and maintenance as well as new sites and features, but aren't expected to support end users directly. However we occasionally (or in the case of the site that features in this story, not so rarely) get end user issues forwarded to us if the client's helpdesk can't fix it.

This particular site is healthcare-adjacent. I'm not in the US so HIPAA doesn't apply but data security is still a particularly big deal for this site compared to some of our other clients - and security of customer data is a big deal for everyone these days.

In the far-off days before the pandemic, I'd been working for months on a Major New Feature that allowed customers to use the site in a different way than before. It touched almost every part of the site and presented some fairly unique problems. We had to request a new feature be added to the in-house platform just for this, which necessitated deferring the Major New Feature's completion until after a separate project to migrate the site through a major version of the platform.

Finally, everything is completed, tested, and signed off. The big release goes fairly smoothly, the Major New Feature appears to be working, and we pat ourselves on the back and relax.

*Cut to shortly after we get in the following morning*

A customer who placed a single order is receiving dozens, no, hundreds of order confirmation emails. He provides a screenshot of his flooded inbox.

Virtually all eCommerce sites have transactional emails - and this has more than many, along with optional text message notifications. One of the implications of the Major New Feature is that it's no longer completely trivial to decide who should be notified by what method about updates to a given order or account. I've written a nice new piece of code that abstracts away all this decision making into one place.

Obviously, I've got something terribly wrong. Are we sending every email update to the same person, this guy? Worse\*, are we sending every update to *everyone*, and this guy is just the first to report it? Either way, it sounds like a significant data security breach, on the site that I would least like to have a data breach on, and it's definitely my fault. It's **panic stations**.

I start looking frantically at my new code and the database, while our senior dev gets into the logs. I've just found the mildly reassuring information that the number of emails the customer appears to have received doesn't match up with orders taken since the release of the Major New Feature, when the senior reports that the order confirmation page for this customer's single order is being requested ten times a minute.

He's refreshing the page ten times a minute. For an hour. We assume that it's some kind of browser extension or something.

A quick proof of concept confirms that you can indeed generate multiple confirmation emails by refreshing that page. Which I hasten to add is not ok, and we immediately put a ticket in to fix it. But this bug appears to have been in the site for years, since before I joined the company. *Of all the days for it to come to light...*

&#x200B;

\*Actually, that probably wouldn't be *much* worse, because at that time we had another issue in the system that would have caused nearly all emails to fail to send in that case.",46,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0AC42E0>
860,The New Guy Chronicles - Episode 2: The Betrayal,"These are the stories of the New Guy.  All of what you are about to read is true.  I write you these tales of mirth and woe, of entertainment and anger with as much accuracy and as little embellishment as I can manage.  Many conversations are written as best I can remember them from my notes and memories about the incidents they describe, but the heart of what you are about to read is as true as I can make it.

Names have been changed to protect the innocent.  And the guilty.

[Episode 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/pcvl1s/the_new_guy_chronicles_episode_1/)

The cast:

 - Jordan - FNG
 - Thomas - Me, the manager and network admin
 - John - The older of my two other reports, primarily responsible for server maintenance, major application upgrades, and supporting our smaller off-site locations and their specific applications
 - Daniel - The younger of my two original employees, though here for the same amount of time as John.  Both longer than me, actually.  Desktop and server support, document management and phone system support, phenomenal people skills.

**DAY 10** - The Betrayal

A little over a week has come and gone.  Jordan remains steadfast in his attempts to drive me and my other two reports to the brink of insanity.  Thus far he has failed a stunningly easy test I devised to assess his problem-solving skills, admitted to underage drinking, attempted to build camaraderie in a conversation with us all by saying ""you guys know how hard it is to pull one over on my mom"", and argued with me about the importance of locking computers when leaving them unattended.  

While he was away from his desk performing a task and I was talking idly with John and Daniel, I walked over to inspect the clutter Jordan had already amassed and noticed a password written on a sticky note.  

Ah, an opportunity to teach an important lesson.  I mentioned it to John and Daniel, and then waited.

""Jordan, what's wrong with your desk?"" I asked upon his return.  

""Uh, I forgot to lock my computer?""

""Well yes, but there's something else.""

""I don't know,"" he declared after looking around.

""What's on that sticky note?""

""Oh!  That's the password that Daniel gave me.""

Daniel, who had been listening to the exchange from his desk, poked his head out from behind his monitors.

""I'm sorry, what?""

""Yeah,"" Jordan replied.  ""It's that [anti-virus] management password you gave me.  You told me to write it down so I wouldn't forget it.""

""I didn't tell you to write any password down.""

""Yeah, you-"" 

I cut in, stopping the conversation and telling Jordan not to worry about it right then.  I again explained the importance of locking unattended computers, and let the issue drop until later in the day when I called him into my office.

""Close the door behind you.  About that password.""

""Daniel gave me that password.""

""I spoke to Daniel and he said he doesn't remember giving you that password and definitely wouldn't have told you to write it down.  You're sure?""

""Absolutely.  That's not like me.""

Intent on giving Jordan every opportunity to come clean I tried again.

""Like I said, I talked to Daniel and he's certain that he didn't give you that password.  I have to agree; it wouldn't be like him to tell you or anyone to write down a password.""

""I'm positive he gave it to me and told me to write it down so I wouldn't forget.""

""You're sure?""

""Yes.""

*deep sigh*

""Jordan, I know for a fact that Daniel didn't give you that password.""

""What do you mean?""

""*I* gave you that password.  In an email, which also explained that you should change it when you log in the first time.""

""Oh.""

""Listen, Jordan.  I've known the whole time what was up and I've been trying to give you the chance to be honest, but you chose right from the start to throw Daniel straight under the bus.  That's not the way to build a good working relationship with your coworkers.  If you keep that up no one is ever going to trust you.""

""OK.""

The conversation ended.  No apology, no remorse, no assurances it wouldn't happen again.  I reported this chain of events to my director, knowing that such a claim of dishonesty on the part of the HR director's son would best be handled between the two directors.  My cries would fall upon deaf ears.

The chronicles would continue.

861,New User Nightmare,"Hello all, it has been some time since my last post on here. Since that last post I have left the service desk job that I had and thought my time at the help desk was over. However much like an ex texting you at 3 in the morning, you can't help but get pulled back in.

This particular day was my first real day out of training, and it should've been a fairly easy day being a Friday and all. However, the IT gods above did not seem to want to give me an easy day. Thus began a multiple call saga, that spilt over into today. So sit back, relax, and enjoy my suffering.

The characters in this story are:

Me: Your storyteller for the moment, and the hero of this anime.

New User: My eternal rival, and the best/worst part of my day.

As our story begins I am just logging in for the day, and within a minute or so I get a call.

&#x200B;

>Me: Hello, thank you for contacting the \[insert company name here\] service desk, I'm Eon can I have your username?  
>  
>New User: \**provides username*\*  
>  
>Me: Wonderful, how can I help you?  
>  
>New User: Hi, I'm new user and I'm trying to setup my computer but I'm stuck.  
>  
>Me: Yeah no problem, what step are you stuck on?  
>  
>New User: On step 3.

Now before we go any further I should explain something. When a user is sent a computer we send them a fairly in depth list of instructions on setting up their device. These instructions are, in my opinion, very easy to follow with one or two issues that most users have. They are so easy in fact that the only thing that would make them easier is if they included pictures. With that little info dump out of the way lets continue.

&#x200B;

>Me: Okay, step 3 should have you reset your password. There should be a website listed on that step as well. Do you see it?  
>  
>New User: There isn't any website listed.  
>  
>Me: Sir I can assure you there is a website listed there  
>  
>New User: No website, just this \[insert web address here\] at the end of the step.  
>  
>Me: \**trying to stop my palm from colliding with my forehead*\* That's the website sir...  
>  
>New User: No it's not.  
>  
>Me: Type that into a web browser and it will take you to the website sir...  
>  
>New User: Why didn't it say that?  
>  
>Me: \**internally ""I shouldn't have to say it""*\* It just assumes that users would know what to do in that circumstance.  
>  
>New User: Yeah, well I don't mess with computers none.  
>  
>Me: Most of our new users don't sir.

From this point the call goes on and I get his password reset and in the instructions it says that an initial password reset can take at least 30 minutes so the user says he'll call back in 30 minutes to continue setup.

**15 minutes later...**

I receive another call from who else but New User.

&#x200B;

>Me: Hello, thank you for contacting the \[insert company name here\] service desk, I'm Eon can I have your username?  
>  
>New User: \**provides username*\* Yeah I just got off the phone 30 minutes ago and am ready to go through the setup some more.  
>  
>Me: Yes sir, it was me you spoke with and based on the time it has not yet been 30 minutes, I recommend calling back in another 15 minutes.  
>  
>New User: Alright

The call gets disconnected and this would be another good time to provide some information. The reason I didn't continue to help is because the ""at least 30 minutes"" isn't an exaggeration, 30 minutes is the quickest that the password will synchronize for first time users in our system. Not sure why though, but that's just how it is.

Back to the story again though.

**15 more minutes later...**

Of course the guy calls in again, and at this point I just recognize the number.

&#x200B;

>Me: Hello, thank you for contacting the \[insert company name here\] service desk, is this \[insert users name\]?  
>  
>New User: Yes this is him.  
>  
>Me: Yes I've been the same agent you've spoken to every time you've called this morning. How can I help you this time?

The user then proceeds to basically tell me his life story, culminating in a summary of his issue. A very incorrect summary mind you, but still a summary nonetheless. I work with him for the next **45 MINUTES!!** On something that the users are expected to do by themselves mind you. Getting a number of questions that would be answered if the guy actually read the instructions that were given to him. I finally manage to talk him into working through it himself, and he agrees stating that he'll call back if he has any other issues. I end the call and pray to any god that will listen that I don't have to deal with him again. 

Later that day he does callback, and is very promptly taken care of by a coworker.

I was hoping this would be the end of my interactions with him, at least until some point far down the line... Today has unfortunately rained on that parade.

I'm just going to give you the cliff notes of this call, as I don't want to transpose it. He called back in because only the default password was letting him sign into his computer, the new password he created wasn't working. His new password would work when in the computer however, this was caused by him not locking and unlocking his computer while on VPN. This was odd to me, since, you guessed it, a step in the setup for the computer! When I mentioned this he of course got defensive because, and I quote ""I followed them steps on the paper"". Luckily the call didn't last that long and I, hopefully, won't have to deal with this guy for a nice loooooong while.

I hope you all enjoyed my little story.",30,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0AC43A0>
862,Never forget to check the basics,"I work for a company that provides a cloud communications platform as a service — developers can use our web service APIs to do a lot of neato stuff. I’m a tier 3 technical support engineer/developer — usually when a ticket makes it to our queue, advanced troubleshooting is needed. 

I suppose that’s how sometimes the team forgets to check off the basics of troubleshooting, and something like this goes over our heads. 

Got a user who couldn’t get our programmable chat API to work. By the time I got the ticket, two of my team members had already done some troubleshooting which included verifying and updating their SDKs, combing through our backend logs, and attempting to debug a snippet of their code. So far, no luck. 

I’m reading through the ticket history and one of the very first replies we got from this user was that everything had been working prior to their account being suspended. Now, I re-route a lot of account suspended tickets — I know that it happens a lot and usually account administration handles it without any fuss. It was totally fair to assume that they had gone through that team already and taken care of that puzzle piece. 

I did think it was odd however that neither of my team members had responded to that bit of information or referenced it again. My brain starts churning the gears — what exactly happens to our API keys when an account is suspended? It makes sense to me that they would become invalid, which would prevent future attempts to generate access tokens or to use our API services. I run this by the team and, with none of us having tried it before, get the suggestion to suspend+reactivate my own test account and see for myself.

Cool. We have a game plan! I start opening some browser tabs, pulling up my own account info as well as the users so that I had everything I needed …

Right there. At the top. In huge, bold letters. 

‘ACCOUNT SUSPENDED’

Welp. 

Mr. Owl, how many developers does it take to notice that an account is inactive? The world does know, unfortunately, and the answer is embarrassing LOL",33,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0AC4400>
863,Thank you for helping me but here is a 400+ word message why you helped me wrong.,"I work for a small OEM company that builds pcs and sell them via different distributors. To find out anything about any configuration we made we prefer to work of the serialnumber as this is unique to every single device. We also have similar configurations which only differ by which mainboard is used or another CPU that is used and all those tiny differences that make a big difference at the end. Today I got a very interesting exchange with a customer that I helped figure out what he wanted but I did it wrong.  
  
  
His first email was as follow:  
Dear company,  
  
2 years ago I bought a pc with windows, but I wish the windows disk was bigger.  
Now I want to use a bigger one.  
Can you tell me what RAM is installed (manufacturer and how many slots are available 4x4 or 2x8 RAM installed?) and if the RAM I want to install would fit.  
Sadly I have no documents regarding this pc and I have no product name and I don't want to take the pc oout of the desk just to see if a serial number might be on the back or to open the case and see how many slots are available. You have to know this kind of information and be able to tell me if I can do that.  
(List of specs like CPU, GPU, amount of disk space on C: and D:, 64x Windows 10)  
I want to use (this) RAM and want to know if its compatible.  
  
  
My response was as this:  
Dear customer,  
  
sadly I can't provide you correct information without a serialnumber.  
There is a freeware called ""Speccy"" that reads all the systemdata and gives you information like productnames of the components and such.  
With the productname you can easily search those on the manufacturers site and find all the needed information.  
  
  
This is a google translate of his respons:  
Thank you very much for your helpful tip with the Speccy, that worked wonderfully and now I know what I have. Of course this is a quick solution, but not really what you mean by ""the customer is king"" or customer-friendly service. ;-)
Therefore I have to say that it would be customer-friendly not only to clip the old serial numbers on the back of the computer, but to store them somewhere under the driver files on the computer. Who is constantly crawling under the desk where he has to determine a tiny number with a flashlight, just because he wants some information from the manufacturer. This is really tedious, especially when you have a dozen cables hanging on the computer, all of which just barely reach the socket. Or do you really expect that we all have desks in the middle of the room? As you can see, that's a typical male way of thinking. (Definition of men's thinking: construction of coffee machines with ultra-modern equipment and in the end all the pots spill because they let their women make coffee for them)
For advertising, companies like you make all sorts of changes so that it flashes everywhere, the customer is led to some partner site and the company logo appears permanently. A little more customer friendliness would be a good idea if you don't provide any support without a serial number.
And why do you actually need a serial number to determine the number and size of the ram banks? And let's be honest, that is completely superfluous for this question, even for a possible reason that is not enough.
The support of a manufacturer should actually know what he has sold, you will surely see that as well.
You only need to collect the data sheets of the computers on offer and write the date of the offer on it, then you can determine within a few minutes which complete systems you sold 2 years ago.
I don't know, but sometimes companies really trip themselves up because they don't come up with the simplest ideas. I just threw a product out of my company because they had such shitty support and overloaded the system with customer-unfriendly nerd functions. On the other hand, I also recommend computers to my company and they are constantly buying new computers for their more than 200 partner companies throughout the country.
You certainly want to shine in your job, so you can bring it in as an ""innovative suggestion"". Sometimes there is even a financial bonus for this.
Well that was a comment. As I said, you helped me so thank you and have a nice weekend  
  
I am unsure what to do with is insightful tip, I forwarded it to my coworkers and my superior hopefully they can figure it out.",93,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0AC4460>
864,"Well, I haven't seen this problem before","I was working tech support for a real estate company.  I was seated in my office/server room when I got a knock at the door.

Then, when she clicked on the Start Menu, the menu popped up, then closed.  She was sure the problem was a virus, and I had to admit, I hadn't seen that problem before.

Me “Could you remove the keyboard dongle from the laptop, this will disconnect the wireless keyboard and then use the laptops own keyboard to enter your password”

866,'Something's wrong with the printer!',"Hey guys!

Currently I'm doing my apprenticeship in a local town hall in Germany to become a sysadmin. My final exams are coming up next year, so I'm pretty much aware of what I'm doing. Working for the government isn't really challenging. Most of the time you help coworkers with simple stuff like 'How to use your second monitor', replacing broken hardware or updating the servers. Really simple work if you ask me.

Right now we've got elections coming up and you can do a postal vote. We've set up a special office for this. This office got a pc, a printer and a barcode scanner so my coworkers don't have to type every name by hand. The barcodes are on the polling cards people get per mail.

One of my coworkers called me that she had some issues with the printer. It just won't work. She claimed that if the used that barcode scanner, the printer won't work which didn't make any sense. The only issue was that the printer wasn't set as the standard printer. I set it as the standard and told her to try again. She refused because she didn't want some important documents printed elsewhere which is understandable because it contains sensible data (it only tried to print it into OneNote which she also didn't understand). My coworker just refused to see that I've fixed the issue and wanted one of the other IT guys to come because she apparently can't trust me because I'm still an apprentice.

That one colleague she tried to call wasn't available so after half an hour of waiting and talking her into it, she finally tried it again. She was a bit shocked that it magically worked and we could move on. But she still was convinced that the barcode scanner was responsible for this issue.",31,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0AC4580>
867,Your new AntiVirus broke a whole division!,"This was back maybe a decade ago, I had just got my start in IT after being out of college and working retail attempting to get out. I had been able to join a small 5 person firm that was in the middle of a merger with another 5 person firm. As such our firm ""IT"" was taking over the IT of the clients of the other company ""Phone Setup"". We came in to one of ""Phone Setups"" big clients, large manufacturing company in the area that basically everyone in this small town had family working for, ""Builder, Inc"".

 I was tasked to work with one of the senior guys in ""IT"" to roll out a new AV for all of the machines at ""Builder, Inc"". Mostly this should've been done via GPO but their old AV (I forgot what it was) had a manual removal process so I was tasked with going to each machine during someone lunch break or downtime to run the uninstall steps, reboot, and reboot again so the AV would install. All in all this was going to take awhile. However not even a week in when we had maybe 25% of the company protected we get a call about how the new AV is causing massive slowdowns to ""all"" the machines they are installed on. Me, being new to IT deferred to the senior tech, but didn't think it was ours as full scanning hadn't been enabled. In fact the only ""scanning"" that was done for this test group was nightly from like 8p-1a.

""Joe"", the lead on this roll out, asks me for a list of devices from each division of ""Builder"" so he can pull one from each to once again separate into another group. So I did that and asked Joe what he was thinking. Joe let me know that since these are old (even at that time) 32-bit machines with 2GB of RAM and XP installed on them (this was near the great XP EoL) that the machines were just slow to begin with and that the users were blaming it on the AV to try and not make their bosses look cheap/lazy for not updating their machines in over a decade. 

I get Joe the list and he makes a new group with some different settings. We wait a week and have a meeting with the client including one of the Shift Managers, Hank,  who had been yelling the loudest about how the new AV was making thing slow. I don't recall it verbatim but part of the conversation went like this:  


Joe: So Hank, how has your machine been running this past week?

Hank: Fantastic! I told you that new Virus Software you put on was slowing us down. We need to go back to that old software as it doesn't keep us from slowing down.

Joe:Are you sure about that? You're absolutely sure that compared to last week everything has been running faster?  


Hank: Yup, its like night and day Joe

&#x200B;

I don't recall the rest of the meeting but after Hank left Joe let the higher ups know that the only change he did was remove the icon on the task bar showing the AV was ""on"" and that all other scanning settings were the same. He even brought up the policies he created and the only difference was the ""Show Icon"" button was unchecked. 

We did eventually have to upgrade those machines ahead of the XP EoL deadline because of the AV but that was down the line and after an upgrade and is another story.",93,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0AC45E0>
868,Because that's the way I was trained.," I was temp worker at a government office. I was a clerk, filing, forms, mail, etc. But folks soon figured out I knew about computers and I responded much faster than the IT team. The IT team was in another building in another part of the city.

One day the admin assistant for the Senior Director flags me down. ""My computer is very slow. Can you look at it.""

Wow this machine is old. Still running plain old DOS. Early 90s, not unheard of, but every other system in the building was running Windows. I start looking around and find the root directory is filled with \*.tmp files. So I clear them all out and reboot. Zoom (relatively speaking) it boots.

She fires up WordPerfect and everything is fine.

A couple of weeks later, same thing. This time I stuck around to see her work. Starts WordPerfect, types up a document, prints it, and shuts off the computer. She grabs another set of notes, starts up the computer, types up the document, etc, etc.

I try to convince to do saves, to not shut off the computer every time. Nope, Nope, that's how she was trained so long ago and she's not going to change.

I'd already done time in the trenches of Tech Support so I knew arguing with a long term Senior Admin Assistant was not worth my time.  


So I created a autoexec.bat file that deleted the tmp files on every start up. She never bugged me again",77,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0AC4640>

**PREFACE**

""We need a new tech on the team.  We have a team of three guys supporting almost 600 users.  Tickets are up almost 60% over the last five years and we can't keep up.  On top of that we have to migrate almost 500 workstations from Windows 7 to Windows 10.  How are we supposed to find the time to do that?""

My director, Laurie, looked at me tiredly.  We'd had this conversation many times, and the answer had always been 'no'.  I hoped this time would be different, but I knew not to hold to that hope too strongly. 

""I'll bring it up with Steve, but he won't want to spend the money on another person.""

Ah.  Steve.  The CEO.  The penny-pincher.  

""Look, I'm not even necessarily asking for a full-time person.  Even a part-time intern or whatever would be a huge boon to the department.  I'm just telling you we don't have the resources to keep up with day-to-day tasks much longer, nevermind a massive migration project.""

""I'll see what I can do.""

A few days later I got word from Laurie that it actually looked promising.  I began excitedly writing job descriptions for two different positions.  One for a full-time tier-1 helpdesk technician, and one for a part-time intern.  This was exactly what we needed.  A full-time helpdesk technician could work almost exclusively on Windows 10 upgrades and get us finished by January 2020 without us having to do much with it at all.  A part-time intern could at least take most of the burden off the main team.  

I sent the job descriptions over to Laurie the next day.  A few hours later I got the call.  We're definitely getting our guy.  

""That's fantastic.  Are we getting someone full-time or part-time?""

""Full-time.""

""Awesome.  Did you take a look at the job descriptions I sent over?  Do you think it needs any changes?""

The briefest of pauses.  ""Well...""

*Oh no.  No good can come of this.*

""He's already picked out, actually,"" she continued.

""Whose kid is it?""

""Was it that obvious?""

""Yes.  Whose kid?""

""Sherry.""

The director of HR?  You've got to be kidding.  Surely she knows better than this.  *sigh*

""Alright.  I'll get with her.""

*a few hours later*

""Hey, Sherry.  I understand your son will be starting with us soon.""

""Yes.  His name is Jordan.  Now you'll have to teach him, because he doesn't have much experience.  But he's very smart and he loves technology.""

""We'll teach him whatever he needs to know.""

""That's great!  He'll start in a few days.  And don't worry.  He'll be treated just like any other employee.""

**DAY 1** - The Arrival

7:50

""Welcome.  I'm Thomas, I'll be your manager.  John and Daniel usually arrive around 8:30; they're the more senior sysadmins.  So how much experience do you have?""

""It's mostly just from playing around with computers at home and stuff to be honest.  I took a couple classes in school but I don't have a degree.""

""Well, as long as you're willing to learn we'll teach you everything you need to know.  I will tell you that a lot of your time - especially at the beginning - is going to be spent upgrading and imaging computers.  It's not going to be particularly fun work.  All of the computers here are still on Windows 7 and we need to be on Windows 10 by January 2020.  Along with imaging them you'll be upgrading a lot.  Some of them are over 10 years old and we'll be adding RAM and upgrading them to SSDs.""

870,Backups keep the machine running,"Another, very recent tale. Caution: german without proofreading skills.

You can guess what the tale is about just from the title, and see in the end if you guessed right.

&#x200B;

The setting:

one robotcell with an IPC\* (Industrial PC, see below) which is connected to the customers company-lan (vlan)

customer difficulty: easy

it difficulty: easy

&#x200B;

players:

$me: me

$itguy: the it guy of the customer

$cust: the customer

&#x200B;

story:

&#x200B;

We installed a new robot cell with an IPC with Win10. My policy is that the $cust gets a patched system which is up to date, and can decide if he wants to run it off grid, or connect it to something and takes the responsibility for security and updates. This customer does the latter, and his external $itguy gets an local admin account and sets his things up (AV, Backup, ...)

After a few days the $cust calls me and tells me that every night at around 9pm the IPC is shutting down, bringing the production to a halt. I have no clue what happens, so I decide to visit the site at 9pm and have a look.

Did you already guessed it?

Yes... the backup runs at 9pm. And the standard-setting for this customer is ""do the backup, and then shut the machine down"". Why? Because the it put the IPC in the office-group for the backup, and not the machine-group. And the office workers have to leave their pcs on, they make the backup and shut down.

A short mail to $itguy solved this rather quickly.

&#x200B;

TL/DR: After the backup the PC gets shut down. Stopping the machine.

&#x200B;

Edit: spelling corrected after I woke up refreshed. 

And a little bit of clarification here and there. 

IPC = Industrial PC

871,So many desktop files.....,"This happened recently, I work as a Systems/Network Engineer, but do a solid amount of Tier 2 ""troubleshooting"".

So I get a call from our hardware guy, who is a great guy, but not the best troubleshooter. He is replacing someone's computer (He does a profile restore from the old computer, which copies down Desktop, Documents, etc, etc) and when he gave it to her, she complained it was incredibly slow on login and when they logged in it was taking a log time for things to load etc, she also mentioned she could not see the files on her desktop.

He calls me up for some guidance. So I remote into the computer and sure enough nothing is showing on the desktop. The computer is definitely crawling too, I look at task manager, nothing seems to be particularly high as far as usage.

Navigating into file explorer I go to the users desktop folder. They had over 2600 files on their desktop.....apparently Windows finally got fed up and decided it just cannot handle loading that many files at login. I promptly highlight all the files and put them into a new ""Old Desktop"" folder, then reboot the machine.

Of course it logs in like a dream and the remaining 7 folders that I left show up on the desktop.

I've been in IT for 10 years and it never ceases to amaze me that someone would think having 2600+ items on their desktop wouldn't be a problem....I don't even understand how this person worked before on their old laptop with that many files.....",156,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0AC4760>
872,Another win for the little guy?,"I work as a field tech for $ISP, a little local company in the U.S.

$client has been having issues lately with their gateway router, which is almost ten years old.

$client, being a fairly high-functioning adult with more sense than God gave a goose, uses this thing called a search engine, actually figures out that their gateway router is probably old, and replaces it.

$client gets a fairly basic home mesh system from the local box store, avoiding the kit from those vendors who want to just suck up ALL your data. $client gets this system home, plugged in, and powered up. Correctly!

$client's Smart TV, less than a year old, from the people who make those cool phones, connects up to the new Wi-Fi network without a problem and starts throwing 'cannot communicate with server' errors.

$client calls mesh system support. Support blames TV manufacturer.

$client calls TV support. Support blames mesh system manufacturer.

$client calls mesh system manufacturer support, conferences in TV manufacturer support. Both mutually agree to blame the ISP.

$ISP phone support determines $client's connection working great. Warns of service fee but $client has had enough and is totally willing to pay the fifty bucks to have someone actually look at their stuff.

Enter me, $FieldTech!

I quickly determine that the new router/mesh system is not, in fact, routing IP traffic. It is actually eating traffic. I log into the gateway, and then run the initial setup process. 

The new router begins routing traffic. The TV works!

$client mutters about recovering the service fee from their router manufacturer. $FieldTech agrees.

It's really not so much the client's fault here, either. S/he downloaded the appropriate smartphone app, connected to the appropriate wifi network, and saw the pretty 'congratulations, you're online!' screen presented by said app, just missed 'Tap here to finish setting up your network'.

Mostly I'm impressively aghast at the support for the mesh system. How did they miss needing to finish the INITIAL SETUP?",32,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0AC47C0>
873,I love it when they threaten to figure it out for themselves.,"Caller: I'm looking in my outlook and a bunch of my emails are missing. 

Me: Ok, I'm looking at your Outlook data file and it's really really large. As that file grows larger and larger the chances for corruption increase. Short term we can scan and repair it. For a long term fix I recommend archiving old email to reduce the size of that PST file.  Remember...we talk about this about once a year and you say you hate archiving and you never want to do it because you lose emails? 

Caller: We've never talked about this before. 

Me: Yep, every time you have an Outlook problem. 

Caller: Well can you tell me how to archive my old email? 

Me: Do you still have the notes I asked you to take last time? 

Caller: YOU HAVE NEVER TOLD ME ABOUT THIS!

Me: I have....repeatedly....for years. I'll be happy to step you through the process but please take notes so you can refer to them in the future. 

Caller: Forget it! I'll just figure it out on my own!

Me: I wouldn't recommend that, there are some default settings you have to change otherwise Outlook will slow WAY down. 

Caller: I'll figure it out!

874,Now you have TWO reviews Dave!,"I'm Dave and once again we going through a mass migration from one tool to another. About 15K will participate in this move.

I'll call the new tool TruthSayer, which is almost absurd as the real name it was branded.

And once again I have drafted extensive documentation, churned out quick reference guides, wrote reports, compiled FAQs, held demo sessions, held Q&As sessions, presented road shows, recorded presentations for replay, composed WBTs, done troubleshooting with the vendor, etc etc. I'm constantly incorporating feedback from all of this to make it all more appealing / accessible / concise etc.

All of this and many many more is listed on our new tool's sorted and organized landing page. A one stop shop if you have ANY questions.

I was chatting with my coworker Stan today when I noticed the landing page had gotten a review. I didn't even know the pages could get reviews. I leaned forward and saw it was a 1 star review. So it sucks I guess?

**Dave**: Huh. Our TruthSayer landing page got a review.

**Stan**: Oh, what was it?

**Dave**: No comments, but they did give it a star. A one star review.

**Stan**: So how many reviews so far?

**Dave**: Just that one, one review.

**Stan**: I see. Here, Dave I'll help you out. Your page now has TWO one star reviews! Gotta go! *<Click>*

875,"D’uh… oh, *that* is what you meant!","I do consumer tech support. Recently I had a very long call about a customer’s elderly computer.  Their display was showing two windows!

Tried to remote in. No joy. Checked for documentation of what I understood to be the issue based on the customer’s responses to my questions. No luck.

After about 40 minutes I realized that the customer’s operating system had gone through an automatic update and wiped the customer’s customized display, including the desktop photo and programs they left open, and it was that which prompted the call. 

15 minutes later I was able to guide them back to the way the computer looked before the update….

876,I just grabbed your ASR disk and... it's ALL GONE!,"New guy joins the support team and we share an office.

I'm the more experienced one, so he's learning the ropes from me.

On one of his very first days, he gets a request to upgrade Windows on a laptop for some big mucky-muck.

Thinking that he'll impress me with his initiative, he starts the process before I get to work.

When I arrive, my new, somewhat reactive office-mate immediately grabs me and starts in with ""I'm in big, big trouble, I'm going to get fired!"" I can see that he's really worried. I can't imagine what he could have done at THIS place that could get him fired so quickly.

""Why, what happened?"" I asked.

""""I needed to upgrade a Windows laptop for \[important guy in corner office\] so I grabbed your install disk... and it... *whiped everything!""*

""What disk did you grab?""

He shows me a disk labeled ""ASR"". Oops. That's NOT a setup disk, it's an Automated System Recovery disk, used for automatically, mass-installing, Windows onto many devices at  the same time. You insert the disk, turn ON the system, and it immediately whipes the harddrive and installs Windows over the network.

I still kinda smile imagining what horrors must have been going through his head as he saw the harddrive suddenly start going crazy....instead of getting a normal Windows setup screen. And then it wouldn't boot afterward? Oh the pain he must have been feeling!

I tell him what he had just done. He asks me why I would have such a dangerous thing in my possession, and actually gets kinda mad at me.

He tells me that the laptop belongs to a *high-level* exec, and he's deathly afraid to tell him that all of his data is now gone. He's sure to be fired on the spot.

I laugh and say ""No, you won't. Come with me, watch and learn, we'll take care of it together. He should have backups or copies of anything important. If he's in such a position in the company, then he's fully aware of his responsibility to protect his and the companies data.""

We go to the guys office and I tell him what had happened. He's disappointed, *really* disappointed. I apologize for the accident, and tell him that we've removed every ASR disk so that it couldn't possibly happen again.

He asks about data recovery. Sure, we can atttempt that, but no guarantees, and it's expensive. I can tell that he's getting more agitated.

As a subtle reminder of *his* responsibilities, I casually mention ""You know, for quite some time now, Support has offered a few different services that will automatically backup your data and even your complete profile. You just never know, *even when things are going perfectly*, when a harddrive might fail, a laptop gets dropped or stolen...""

He stood there and I see a transformation come over his face. He gets it.

""Yeah, I should have enrolled this into the \[automatic backup process\] a long time ago."" He even knew the name of the backup software we were using?

We eventually leave and  never hear of it again.

The new guy eventually moved to Executive Support, so I guess he was just a glutton for punishment...",112,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0AC4940>
877,Client cannot accept they're wrong,"Hey TFTS, first time posting, which is odd since I've worked all my professional life in application support and couldn't think of a story to post even though I have thousands.

My first job in London was providing 1st and 2nd line of support to a reporting software my company built and sold to clients in the financial sector.

We had two types of clients: hosted or in-house install. While the first were easy to debug (log in to their environment, replicate and assess, all while having full access to the back end), the others were less so for obvious reasons, yet we kept a (virtually stale) copy of their initial environment to provide some semblance of support. This story, obviously, is about the latter type.

The software itself was like Tableau, in which you add objects to a sheet (graphics, tables, images,...) to create a template, and the workflow fills in the latest data as often as you want it (daily, weekly, monthly,...) and generates the final report in the format you want, the most common being Word or PDF.

Also, the software used a proprietary third party software to convert Word documents into PDF. Don't recall which one it was, but we would buy the license ourselves and would give it to the client for their in-house install. We didn't only recommend this software in our install documentation but insisted that they use it since our product only ""supported"" this vendor in particular (meaning it could probably work with others, but we only tested this particular one, so could only ensure it works as expected with it and it alone).

So, the ticket in question was floating around for a while, bouncing from one Support member to another, and no one could figure it out. We were only 4 in the Support team, so it was bound to land on my plate eventually. Also, side note, I was the youngest (by far) in the team, and my impostor syndrome was high, so I was dreading my turn to have a go at this issue.

The problem was that the generated PDF reports were showing the objects completely misaligned compared to what they were supposed to look like. Moreover, this only happened when generating PDFs; Word docs came out as expected. 

So, this being an in-house installation, we could only try to replicate it on our end to no avail. A co-worker tried to get a copy of their database to get our environment in line with the client's, but that was turned down because of ""sensitive information"" that they couldn't share (what's the point of non-disclosure contracts?). Another co-worker tried a screen sharing session but all it helped for was to see the report being generated incorrectly, since their IT team wouldn't let us take a look at the back end and see if the software was installed properly.

By then, the client was getting impatient with how long it was taking for this issue to be resolved. So having this information telling me how tied my hands were, plus the pressure on being the last line of defense, I do the first thing I can come up with: I check in Acrobat Reader who is the PDF Producer of the file the client sent. Usually, you would expect to see the name of the third-party software as the creator, but lo and behold, the client was using some other tool for the PDF conversion (why? As I said, we provided the license for FOR FREE!!! So it wasn't a matter of saving pennies). 

So, I happily send my reply to the client stating ""Unfortunately, you're using a software we don't support, please use [product name] as is specified in our documentation.""

One would expect the issue to be closed: the client was caught red-handed using our software incorrectly, thus in breach of contract. However, as you read the title of this story, this was not the case. All I got in return was a condescending reply to my email CC'ing the account manager on our company and my boss stating ""This is ridiculous, [Account Manager's name]. This has taken long enough. Can't someone fix the damn problem?""

I wish I could say the story had a satisfying ending but unfortunately for me, my company was ""too British"" in their mentality and followed the creed of ""the customer is always right"". I didn't hear back on this issue, and luckily that client didn't raise many tickets, so I didn't have to deal with them again. My guess is that the AM had to convince them to use the third-party software we supplied, but I never asked her how that discussion went.

All I got was a chuckle from the rest of the team saying ""how didn't I think about that before?"" and a pat on the back from my manager which would come back and haunt me for the rest of my days at that company since I became known as the ""last resort"" guy, which meant I had to deal with all the troublesome tickets.",119,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0AC49A0>

879,Too much training?,"I'm an IT Director of a medium sized business, have been pushing cybersecurity training for the users for several years now. Some of the users are so paranoid about opening emails, they forward the emails to me for confirmation first.  I usually tell them to trust their judgment (after I check to make sure it was safe).

But today a salesperson forwarded an email he thinks was a customer sending him pics of something but was not sure.  It took about 10 seconds for me to realize he forwarded a text he received to his email and forgot he did it. The email came from <phone#>@mms.att.net and he didn't notice the number was his own.

880,"The phones worked when I tested them connected to the ISP gateway, why doesn't it work when I plug it in at people's desks? What's a firewall? - The IT Company That Replaced Me","So, I do freelance IT for small businesses. One of my customers decided to replace me. The ""company"" they replaced me with is really just the IT Director of the local community college. He is a people manager, and know next to nothing about actual IT. But he's a friend of one of the employees and he's cheap.  So I tell my customer good luck and contact me if the every need me.

It wasn't even a week and the first thing this guy tried to do he botched.

I get a call from him in a panic. He was tasked with replacing their ancient AVAYA phone system with a modern VOIP system.  This is what he did:

He tested all the phones connected at his office, and they worked. The next day he takes them out to the customer's office. He plugs a phone directly into the ISP gateway and the phone connects. So he calls the VIOP company and tells them all is good, the phones are connecting correctly, and they can start porting the phone numbers over from the POTs lines to the VOIP service.

While the porting is happening, he starts disconnecting the old phones at people's desks and connecting the new VOIP phones.  And when he is done he realizes none of the phones are connecting.

The VOIP company tells him to run a connection test tool on his laptop plugged in through one of the phones and sure enough the connection is being blocked.

But by this point the numbers are already ported to the VOIP service and the customer is without phones, and he has no clue why they aren't working.

That's when I get the call. He explains what he did and I asked him why he didn't test the phones from behind the firewall. And I shit you not, his exact words were ""What's a firewall?""

Seriously, he had no clue what a firewall was. He always just assumed you plugged everything into the ISP gateway and used that. I was floored. This is a guy that is doing business IT and he doesn't know what a firewall is.

Oh, and the kicker, his next project is to set up a site to site VPN connection between their current office and a new office they just rented. He told them he totally knows how to do that.  They guy that doesn't know what a firewall is claims he knows how to setup up site to site VPNs.

So I logged in remotely and set up the firewall properly to work with the VOIP phones. I'm sure the owner of the business will question why I had to be brought in to fix the phones when he receives my detailed bill.

TL;DR - Customer of mine when with a cheaper friend of an employee for their IT and fired me. The person they hired doesn't even know what a firewall is.

EDIT: Just a small update on some things. 

1. Yes, I got paid.
2. I was waiting to see the total failure that was going to happen with the new firewalls and VPN setup before doing an update. But it's been a month and he still hasn't managed to get the new firewalls working.
3. They actually had me come into the new second office and setup their copier/printer/scanner on the network. They needed to start using this office and needed to be able to print and scan. But since there wasn't a firewall there yet, they were just setup using the ISP's gateway. I told them it is best to get the firewall installed first, and without a VPN they wouldn't be able to print/scan between offices like they wanted. They understood this, but needed the employees at the new office able to print and scan.
4. For some reason, even after waiting a month and wasting money having me come out to set up the copier temporarily, they still want to let the other guy setup the firewalls and VPN. He must be doing it for really cheap.",205,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0AC4AC0>
881,Troubleshooting cheat...,"I recently read a post from someone telling a story of one of his students not checking his hardware while troubleshooting a problem and it reminded me of my early days in electronics.

I got my electronics training in the Navy. Basic Electronics School was the base level training you got back then and they had labs where you would have live hardware with simulated failures you were required to troubleshoot.

Since when I joined the Navy I had already had two years of Electronics in college, BES was pretty boring to me. But I did have one experience that really changed my ability to troubleshoot.

Part of the training was to do visual inspections on the hardware. You know. Look for blown capacitors or burnt out resistors. Maybe an exploded IC chip. 

So the first couple of times I did just that. But at some point I realized that I could see just how these simulated failures were created. Shorted cap? A bit of fine wire under the cap. Open trace? Razor cut on the bottom of the board. Resistors painted with the wrong color codes. Etc. 

Got to the point where I was not even powering up the equipment before writing my assessment. I flew through that program. And because of that experience to this day I do a solid visual inspection before ANY other troubleshooting. It saves SO much time and effort.",23,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0AC4B20>
882,Check the hardware,"TL;DR at the end.

Some years ago I needed a particular sort of sensor for my biology research. It was neither high-precision nor particularly complex, but it was strange. No one sold anything like it. So I designed and built the sensors I needed on a minimal budget, on a scratched-up table at home, using a soldering iron half my own age. And then, through a series of improbable events, this sensor got a lot of attention. It made the college I work at look good and to this day if you search for my real name what you’ll probably find is the college’s press releases about how my device will solve world hunger and cure AIDS while you sleep. As an indication that even the college did not believe this they rewarded me with a $15 gift certificate at the local coffee shop.

However, the computer science (CS) department did notice that I had just done something that looked very much like “Internet of Things” and made me an offer: instead of building my next device on a table at home using a soldering iron from the Late Paleolithic I could use their very nice lab, with lots of equipment, and even raid their parts bins, as long as I also passed off some of my knowledge to their students. And so I ended up spending a lot of time in the CS lab. This story comes from that time. Some details of actual projects have been fuzzed because specific projects would de-anonymize me quite easily.

On the day this story begins I am in lab laying out a circuit. As I am doing so I am chatting with the students, a small group who I have come to know fairly well, who spend most of their free time in the lab tinkering with things. One student, who I will dub Hamilcar (who doesn’t like the Second Punic War?) calls me over for troubleshooting.

I get up from my chair, careful to bring my cup of coffee with me. When troubleshooting with students a cup of coffee is essential, because you can raise it to your face and take a sip from it to hide the fact that while your voice is saying, “That happens sometimes,” your face is saying, “I don’t think you’ve fully recovered from that brain injury.”

Hamilcar’s project involves a speaker. He’s quite early on in working on it and only has the speaker attached to an audio control board/amplifier which is, in turn, attached to an Arduino. (Arduinos are programmable microcontrollers.) Hamilcar points to his screen where a small program is open in an IDE. “This \[points\] should play a small tune through here \[points\]. But nothing is happening.”

“When did it break?” I ask.

“It never worked,” he responds.

This seems strange. I question him a bit more. As I think we all know the right way to build this device would be: 1) wire up the speaker, run current through and make sure you hear something. 2) write a tiny piece of code that just makes some sort of noise, verify that you can get the code on the Arduino and get noise out of the speaker. 3) turn “make a noise” into “make these specific noises”. What Hamilcar has done is wire everything together, write a giant block of code, and then test it.

“Have you checked the hardware?” I ask. Always start troubleshooting at step zero. I then have to explain that I mean “have you done anything to verify that the hardware works?”

“It’s wired correctly,” Hamilcar says. This is not what I asked.

“Have you ever gotten any sound out of that speaker?” I ask. “A blip when you plugged it in? A short code snippet that just makes it hum? Anything to test it?”

“No!” Hamilcar exclaims, clearly unreasonably annoyed by these questions. Other students look up from their projects and stare at him in surprise. “It’s plugged in correctly! I’m not an idiot!”

I bring my coffee cup up to my face and take a long sip. “But did you test it?”

“No!” Hamilcar yells. I understand, a bit, where his frustration is coming from. He does have some real skills from his own, independent study, and nothing he’s done yet has been able to showcase this. He feels like we don’t believe that he knows things. On the other hand, he’s being an ass.

I bring the coffee cup down and give Hamilcar The Look. If you ever find yourself teaching teenagers or young adults make sure to practice The Look. Done correctly, the victim should feel the chill of the coming winter creeping into their bones and hear the distant howl of the first wolves picking up their trail. “This is,” I say, gesturing expansively with my coffee mug while continuing to glare, “Computer SCIENCE. We TEST things. Check your hardware.” I then remind him that the day before I had wasted time debugging a bad solder joint.

Hamilcar makes his saving throw against The Look. “I know how to solder!”

I point out that the years of his life are but a blink of my eye, and that while I had learned to solder as the great ice sheets retreated at the end of the Younger Dryas he had learned to solder two weeks earlier, from me. And that his solder joints still closely resembled metal potatoes.

“You’re not helping!”

“No,” I finally agreed, “I’m not. And I won’t, until you check your hardware.” Then I walked back to my bench. And thus began the descent into madness.

Day One: Hamilcar has discovered that Arduinos are not very good at keeping time by themselves. He has a theory that this is, somehow, messing up the speaker. Perhaps the sound frequencies are being compressed into the ultrasonic, or something. He’s fiddling around with clock chips, which are really only needed when your time intervals are hours or days. Obviously, this just further complicates his untested circuit and doesn’t help.

Day Two: Hamilcar spends an hour undoing his clock chip changes from yesterday. He is now convinced that he is running the Arduino at the wrong internal clock speed. This can happen to the chip-brain of the Arduino but only if you buy that chip yourself and wire it up. Inside an Arduino that won’t happen.

Day Three: Hamilcar is now propounding a new theory to the other students. Arduinos use a C-derived coding language. But what if this language does not handle global and local variables in the same way? Much like the Carthaginian invasion of Italy, this theory serves only to cause a lot of destruction and get people angry without actually making any progress towards winning the war.

Day Four: Hamilcar is bouncing his latest idea off another student. At this point Hamilcar’s broken circuit and his refusal to test the hardware have become a running joke. Before he gets past the first sentence of his new theory the other student asks, “Have you checked the hardware?” Hamilcar explodes in anger. The other students just shake their heads, and I eventually have to tell him to use his inside voice.

Day Five: Hamilcar is hunched over his station, muttering something in an unknown language. Is this a dark ritual to the old gods of blood and fire, meant to strike me down for questioning his soldering skills? Has he completely snapped and is speaking in a new language that makes sense only to him? I listen more closely. No, he’s just swearing continuously under his breath.

Day Six is a Saturday. As a biologist I sometimes have to come in to work on a weekend to keep my living study subjects, well, living. I had also glued some pieces together on a device on Friday, so I swing by the CS lab to see if they set up correctly, and, if so, to glue the next set.

The lab is quiet, empty of students. As much as I like joking around with the students it’s relaxing to be alone and able to focus. I finish my own project and decide to check Hamilcar’s project. If I can debug it I’ll steer him correctly on Monday.

There’s no multimeter on Hamilcar’s station (of course) but once I grab one his power and ground check out. The Arduino is pinned-out correctly, and I’m getting power where I should there, too. The audio controller/amplifier is a bit of a mystery. I haven’t used this design before. I unlock the computer and find that Hamilcar already has the wiring diagram open. Power is solid. Ground is ground. LVL is….not attached to anything. What the hell is LVL, anyway? I know that the chip can do much more complicated things than what Hamilcar is doing with it, so maybe it’s not needed. But debugging means figuring out what things are. I find a webpage where someone is using LVL on this chip in their own circuit. I look at what they seem to be doing with it. It’s not amazingly helpful. I bend over to poke at the chip with the multimeter, just to see if I can tell if LVL is output or input. As my head gets close to the chip I hear a faint sound in the quiet of the room. I pick up the speaker and put it up to my ear. It’s playing a tune. Right. LVL. As in “sound level”. Thirty seconds later I’ve decoded the wiring diagram and have LVL attached to 5V power. The speaker is humming out a tune clear as day. I leave a text file open on the computer. “Checked your hardware. Amplifier on chip was not powered.”

Two months later we’re sitting in lab. A new student loudly complains to no one in particular that his starter exercise (get an LED to blink) isn’t working. “Did your LED power on solidly when you first plugged it in?” I ask.

“No,” the new student says. “Does that matter?”

A wave of apocalyptic fury breaks over us, a roar of sound and anger. It’s Hamilcar. “CHECK YOUR DAMN HARDWARE!”

TL;DR: Student has an issue with a program. I tell him to check the hardware. He doesn’t. It’s the hardware.",135,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0AC4B80>
883,"""Go fix the router.""","Before I switched to a more emotionally fulfilling (and financially devastating) career in teaching about 20 years ago, I was a network engineer and project manager for a multi-national logistics company. I had just been on the road for three weeks straight bringing up a new site. On my second day home the boss calls.

It seems a different site, for a different project manager, has a problem. That manager is on vacation. So I get told to deal with it. After some phone calls it sounds like a router isn't mounted in the rack properly. I even ask for a picture, but it is too blurry to make out the issue. But the site manager (our client) is pitching a fit about how messed up it is. 

I logged into the router. It was working fine. There were zero network issues. But the client wanted it fixed *NOW*. So I call the boss and tell him. He tells me, ""Go fix the router.""

I made an absurd amount of money for the work I did. I was way too overpaid to fly out to California to fix this crap. But the client was screeching in his ear like a harpy. 

Fine. 

I booked a flight for the morning, which cost the company a fortune. No one cared, since it was just being billed to the client as part of the larger ""travel costs"" line item for us engineers flying around the country. Hotel. Rental car. Meals. Well over $1,800. EDIT: That was just travel costs. Not counting a day and a half of pay and benefits. 

When I walk in and see the issue, I about shit. The issue was the top right screw was cross-threaded and in at an angle, instead of in straight and flush. I got the drill, backed the screw out, and put it back in. Walked out and left.

Anyone could have done what I did in the same 30 seconds.",25,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0AC4BE0>
884,My computer won't open since you guys worked on it.,"So, let me bring you back in time to when I first started working in IT. Which was roughly a year ago. Before I had worked this job, I had zero IT experience, just my experience of solving problems by googling them, and building computers, coding a little, stuff like that. So I had been hired for this job which was a consumer tech store, with a helpdesk that the general public could come to and pay us to fix their machines. It was my very first day. 

I had been showed around the shop, had people show me the ticketing system, and watched a few interactions with some customers from the more experienced techs there. They decided, ""hey, he seems ready to man the front counter and take the next few people that come in"". So, they let me just hang out and wait. Cue the user. 

An older woman walks in with her laptop, plops it on the counter. 

Me: Hi, how can I help you?

User: Well, I had you guys replace the screen on my computer, and now it doesn't open up. 

She had a laptop, and was clearly irate at the fact that we could be so incompetent as to give her a laptop back that didn't even open. I watched her attempt to open it. The problem was clear. She was attempting to open the laptop from the hinge side. 

Me: Alright, well let me go ahead and give it a try.

I place my hands onto the laptop lid, and simply slide my fingers under the display, and open the laptop, making sure that I don't open it from the hinge side. A 50/50 chance, but by god I did it.

The laptop is open. I look at her. She looks at me. I don't really remember what I said, but it was most likely something like, ""well, looks like its working now."" She called me a smartass and left. 

This was my very first issue I troubleshooted in IT. This issue is what made me sure that I could do this job, and I would be good at it. I was filled with confidence, and it was a great first day. 

To this day, it boggles my mind that this occured. This woman picked up her laptop from us. We make a point of showing the user that the computer works and their problem is solved when they pick it up and pay. In the case of a laptop screen replacement, we probably turned it on and showed her it worked. It just shocks me that this person, who most likely saw it be opened and working, took it home, attempted to open it, and always tried from the same side. It shocks me that this person, instead of doing literally any level of problem solving, picked up their laptop, got into their car, and drove to our store, had me open it, and drove back to their home. I would assume they invested at least 30 minutes round trip.

To this day, I'm still not quite sure what to say to people when the problem is them and it is very clearly them. I usually just say, ""haha we all make mistakes I guess"", but even this feels insufficient.",113,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0AC4C40>
885,“Flosstradamus crashed my laptop?”,"So this happened like a year ago. If you don’t know who Flosstradumus is, he is a DJ who got big making EDM Trap music, take a listen to the mixtape I’m about to tell you about and you’ll see why this is so funny. 


Anyway customer comes in with a laptop with a sporadic screen issue. Laptop is fine but will shut down or have a glitchy screen shortly after startup. It also needs a new battery but that’s a different issue that has little effect on this issue. The customer also said “do any upgrades you can id like to keep it for a few more years.” It was almost 8 years old but I had the same model I kept for 10+ after upgrading it. 

So I open it up expecting it to be a loose ribbon cable. Nope. Let’s upgrade the memory see if that fixes it. Nope ok. …Hmm let’s run a scan on the hard-drive. Error. Ah that’s it let’s give it an SSD, (it was built right before SSDs became standard.) I start transferring their data and boom something errors out. The error looks suspicious it’s just a bunch of emojis and broken text. I look and notice it stopped transferring in the music folder. So I go through their music, good collection, tons of nostalgia, this person was about my age and was recommended by a friend so we had a lot of similar tastes. Anyways I’m scrolling and I see something that looks like this. “⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️ BANNED MIX TAPE ⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️” with a bunch of that broken text and more emojis. 

I laugh because I know the artist and remember that stupid shit DJs would do to stand out. 

I renamed the file and poof errors go away and the laptops working fine. I transfer the data and install the new SSD. Customer comes in and asked what was wrong with it. I tell them it was an old Flosstradamus mixtape with a bad file name and they responded…. “Flosstradamus  crashed my laptop?” 

We had a good laugh and since we were in similar friends groups I ask them from time to time if their laptop stills going strong and yup that was the real issue.",9,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0AC4CA0>
886,Can you rebuild our company?,"Several years ago, I worked as a software developer for a company that provided network and desktop support for our customers.

This story is about a new customer we got, that was an ecommerce business.  They hired us to fix some of their servers, but the problem was much, much deeper than that.

It seems that the company had, over a period of several years, gradually let go each and every person in their IT department.  The last IT employee had provided a couple of Word documents containing some server IPs and admin credentials, and then they let him go.  This seemed to be part of a larger pattern, as the company was housed in a large business complex, which they used to fully occupy.  However, half of the building was now unoccupied, a significant portion of the building was sublet to other companies, and the current staff was maybe half a dozen people.

This company had over a dozen servers, but no network diagram, and no one there who even understood what most of the servers did.  Our techs did their best to sort it out based on the ""documentation"" from former IT, and managed to restore the server that failed (that server failing was what prompted the company to reach out to us).

A couple of weeks later, I was called in to meet with the person running the company (the actual owners were completely removed from the company's operations; it was simply a cash cow that they had zero involvement with).  It seemed that separate from the initial failed server, their ecommerce site was now broken.  

Keep in mind, this ecommerce site is literally the entire product of the company.

They wanted me to fix the site.  However, they didn't have any documentation for the site.  They didn't have anyone on staff who understood the code base.  They didn't have credential to the source control.  They didn't even know which servers the application was hosted on.  Apparently they had outsourced 100% of the development of the application to Russian programmers (we're in the US) nearly a decade ago.  The programmers built the app, configured all of the interactions, and provided zero documentation (or possibly the company discarded the documentation).

After some investigation, I discovered that the application was actually scattered among at least 3 different servers.  2 of the servers were AWS, and... the company did not know the username and password of the AWS account.

They did have credentials for the third server, but that was simply the host for the front-end interface, and a customer mailing list.  All of the actual business logic (which the manager I was working with could only explain in the most rudimentary terms) was hosted on those two AWS sites.

I did find the problem (an expired security certificate), and we got them back up and running, but I did my best to explain that if anything else went wrong, there was an excellent chance that there would be no way to fix it.

2 weeks later, the site went down again.  One of the AWS sites wasn't accepting HTTP requests anymore.  When I explained that I couldn't access the server to find out what was happening, because they didn't have credentials, I was asked if I could just rebuild the application on a new server.  I told them that it was possible, but that I'd need someone to explain, in detail, all of the necessary business logic, and that they'd lose their customer database (again, no credentials) and have to start that over from scratch.

They said ""oh, okay,"" and that was the end of the conversation.

I have no idea if they're still in business.",103,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0AC4D00>
887,Roll perception check.. critical failure.,"Soooo, I just read the funniest email about a ticket I had worked on last week.

I had a user call in last week saying that her laptop webcam doesn't work in any application. I asked her to try it in Teams and in the Microsoft camera app, she says she had and it doesn't work in either.
No worries, I'll remote in and take a look.

Sure enough it seems like the computer thinks the camera is working but just seeing black.

I asked her if there was a shutter on the camera - no

I asked her if there was anything obstructing the camera - no

Nothing like a sticker, or anything behind the glass of the screen - no

No damage, no nothing - no

I asked if there were any switches near the camera - no

So you can see the camera lens in the centre top of your screen and there is no damage or obstruction - yeah it's all clear.

Ok, maybe there is an issue with the sensor and the software isn't recognising a problem with the signal.

Time to troubleshoot.

So I went on to try a bunch of typical solutions, reinstalled the drivers, did Windows updates, tried disabling and reenabling or removing and readding the camera in device manager, tried looking on the Dell site for the latest drivers for the camera. I go as far as to update all the drivers and the BIOS on the computer, nothing is working.

I ran the Dell diagnostic tools and it runs through, doesn't seem to attempt to fix anything just comes up at the end saying failure with a warning exclaimation symbol, no error code, no nothing.

The Windows hardware diagnostic tells me the camera is fine.

I call Dell and tell them we have a device where the camera is not working and nothing I have done seems to fix it, I'm getting an error from the dell diagnostic but there is no code or description, we need a technician to come out.

They ask me the usual about physical damage, BIOS and driver updates, etc.. but they agree we need to send a tech out.

I give Dell the clients contact details with the ok from the client so that Dell can organise a warranty visit with the client.

They have called the client to confirm there is no damage and do their own troubsleshoot and everything.
I get the email Friday to say the technician is en route.

Awesome the client will be happy with a quick turn around. I finish up for the day as I am on the early shift where I work. Job well done.

I just checked my emails today to find the technicians report and opened it because why not, lets see what the problem was. I want to know if there was anything I had missed or that I could check in future, as you do.

Technicans notes: Opened the shutter.

..... ""Opened the shutter""

You what?

I just wish I was there for the moment that the Dell technician walks in, opens up the laptop, and flicks the camera shutter open. I would have loved to have seen the Jackie Chan confused look on his face and the look of total embarassment on the client.

Lesson of the day: client's are stupid, and there is no winning..

TLDR: client is obtuse, misses camera shutter when directed to check for one, Dell warranty technician finds it instead.

888,"Document your network, or else!","Way back at the turn of the century, 2001 I think, I was working in a University computer research department.  The guy who had hired me had moved on and I was the only support person around until we could hire someone.  Our network infrastructure was pretty primitive, no firewall, no managed switches, and poorly documented cable mapping.  Our primary patch panel had over 400 drops, some were labeled with what room and plate number they connected to, many did not.  The wall plates in many offices were not labeled, or worse, incorrectly labeled.  At this time we didn't have a cable tracer.

One day I got an email from the University computer security guys, they had been contacted by someone reporting malicious activity from the University, the IP traced back to my department.  The IP was on one of my Class C networks, so I went to work to find the malicious machine.   We had a lot of students running ""self administered"" systems in those days, so this was not completely unknown.   

The problem was our switches were so old I had no way to find which switchport was connected to the bad system.  I could narrow things down to a stack of switches, each had 48 ports although not all were connected.  I set up a laptop running a ping to the ""bad"" IP, and started pulling the patch cables one at a time.   Really basic, right?   I found what appeared to be the correct connection after a few minutes.  So, the immediate problem was solved, this system was off the network, but I still needed to find the system, find the student, ensure the system got patched, all that jazz.

I traced the patch cord to the patch panel, it was labeled with a room and plate number.  No problem, I had a sub master key so I could access every office in that area.  I walked to the room and found, no computer, no monitor, no keyboard, not even a desk.  There was a lot of junk, old chairs, a futon, a partition (so the room could be divided for two people), lots of various trash on the floor.   I guessed one of the grad students had actually been living in it, against the rules but it happened.

I was really scratching my head, checked the wallplate in the room, nothing plugged in at all.  There were a couple of old power cords scattered around, but no computer.  Went back to the server room and repeated all the steps,  confirmed I had disconnected the correct switchport.  

I spent some time checking nearby offices, in case the wallplate was in a different office, but found nothing.  It was really bugging me so I went back to the original office and did a more complete search.  And of course, there was an old desktop computer, no monitor or keyboard, hidden behind the futon and connected to a second wall port.   I left a ""please see me"" note on the computer, removed the network cable, and asked our department administrator who was in the office.  No one was.  OK, who USED to be in the office.  Some student, no longer at the University.  

Back to the office, yanked the computer (it wasn't a university owned computer, student must have bought it himself).   I stored the computer and figured I'd wait to see if anyone complained.   No one did so after a month or so sent it to e-waste.

I also created a project for myself get a cable tracer and a label maker and had some students start checking and labeling the drops in the whole department.  There were many occasions when I'd get a request to activate a wallplate and spend an hour trying to figure out which patch panel it connected to.",76,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0AC4DC0>
889,magically changing network addresses,"Another story from days working support in University.   Several years ago my department outgrew the office space in our building.  We made a deal with another department in the building next door to get some additional offices, in return we provided computer support.  This wasn't too hard since their computer needs were not as difficult as ours, plus the network was 100% maintained by our campus network team.

Late one afternoon I got a call from a graduate student in the other building.  The desktop system he had appeared to be working but he had no network access.  I thought maybe the network card was bad (this was an older system that used a PCI ethernet card), so I grabbed a spare and headed over.  Since this machine was on a different campus network than our department it used a local username and password, like a laptop, so we could login even without any network connection at all.  

I logged in and started troubleshooting, checked the network config and restarted networking (Linux box using DHCP), and it got an address, so I was stumped for a moment.  I kept poking around and restarted networking, forced getting a new DHCP lease, stuff like that, and then the shoe dropped.  I was getting an unroutable address, 192.168.x.x when I knew that the campus DHCP server gave out addresses in real University IP space.  I checked another computer in the same office and it had a University IP.  Since unroutable IPs were blocked at the building gateway, no surprise this machine had no internet access.  

At this point I guessed someone in a nearby office had probably plugged in a wireless router so they could have their own private wifi, and it was configured to serve DHCP on the wired side.  I looked around the office but there wasn't anything there.  I restarted the DHCP client on the computer a few times and finally got an address on the proper network.  I told the student that he should be OK for the rest of the day and called the main network guys and explained what I found.  

They asked me to try and find the ""rogue"" DHCP server, but I explained I had no keys to any of the offices and it almost 5 o'clock, so sorry, I was out of there.   I knew they had master keys to every building and office, unlike me, so it was up to them.

I found out the next day someone had come over and searched around until they the router and yanked it.  I'm guessing they left a nasty note for the owner.",34,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0AC4E20>
890,Mr. Know-it-all does not know it all,"A while ago, I got a funny ticket from a well known problem user. He had it all; thought he knew everything, was impatient, acted disrespectfully, and best of all throttled his system every chance he got. I can't count how many laptops this guy went through under my care. 

One day, he put in a ticket about not being able to connect to the VPN. My stomach sank and I knew I was in for a bad morning. Usually, these issues aren't too complicated but this guy took things to another level with his complaints and general bad nature.

I  start off by making sure he has the right access. Check. Next I look at the firewall logs to see if there's any errors coming from his system when he tries to connect. There are some errors but they actually don't point me anywhere useful.

I'm a bit lost at this point and illogically try to ping his machine just because I don't know what else to do other than tell him to reinstall his VPN client. 

Surprise: it works. Oddly enough, it doesn't have an IP from the VPN's DHCP scope which makes no sense. I fired back a carefully typed email asking where he was connecting from. He replied: from company HQ building D.

Turns out this genius was visiting the company HQ and trying to connect to the VPN but couldn't figure out why it wasn't working for him. He could've accessed everything on the network without the VPN but instead tried and failed, then got frustrated and made a ticket. Of course, upon realizing his mistake, he left no reply whereas on other tickets, he will leave complaints if the solution doesn't perfectly fit his needs.

891,Math...what a concept,"Back in 2009, our company purchased a horribly mismanaged company mostly for their technical ability and their customers.  I was asked to come to the President’s office and meet one of the “crown jewels” of this acquisition was a guy we will call “Fred.”

For background, our IT Department falls under the accounting department and headed by the CFO/Treasurer.  I do not work for or report to the President in any way, but professional courtesy he usually gets what he wants (for the most part.)

Fred seemed nice enough.  We exchanged pleasantries and the president mentioned that he would be needing a new, beefy, top-of-the-line PCs for this new venture.  I told him “No problem!  Just let me know the specs and I’ll get it done.” and I went on my merry way.

Later that day the president asked me to stop back by his office for “a little chat.”

Towards the end of the day, I swung by his office. 

The president wanted to let me know that Fred and his teams were “really smart” guys and that they would “probably be the IT team” for the company “someday in the future.”  It would be best to really do a good job on this as this guy would likely be my boss at some point in the future.

So I was already kind of bristling at this because, as it stood, I was in charge of IT (even if it was only me and one other guy) and I didn’t like the idea of a demotion.

Then he handed me a piece of paper with the specs that Fred wanted and needed “to be able to work properly.”  

It read (going from memory) as follows:

HP or Dell Laptop
Must have Intel i7-720QM
Windows 7 32 Bit
32 GB of RAM
500 GB HD
ATI or NVidia graphic card

I kind of snickered.  I said “can we call him?”  

We got Fred on the phone.

“Fred, did you mean to specify Windows 7 64 Bit?”

“No,” says Fred “It has to be 32 bit.  64 Bit won’t work with the applications I use.”

“Okay.  So then we’ll drop the memory down to 4 GB.”

“No!” says Fred “I need 32 GB or I won’t be able to work efficiently.”

So I tell the “really smart” guy that 32 GB won’t work in a 32 bit system.  

He insists it will, he knows what he needs and what he is doing, and just order it the way he specified.  He can configure it to work just fine.

I tell him that I would love to see this (as it basically breaks math.) 

Long story short, I order it and, Lo and Behold, a 32-bit system can only use 4 GB of memory.  

He tells the president that I must have done something wrong with the set up or something on the network was preventing it from using all 32 GB.

*Facepalm*

Later in the week my CFO/Boss wants to have a meeting with me to discuss why we cannot configure it the way he wants and what we can do to solve this issue.  So I go to the meeting and my boss asks me “what is preventing you from configuring this the way he wants.”

“Math.”

“Math?”

“Yes, Math.  You see what 32 bit and 64 bit means is how many address registers a computer can access in memory.  32 bit means it can access 2^32 address registers or a little over 4 billion ones and zeros, or 4 gigabites.  That’s it.  It’s not up for debate.  I can stick a hundred sicks of memory in there and it will still only use 4 GB.  It cannot be changed because you cannot change the math.”

“Did you explain it to him?”

“No, I did not.  Because he said he wanted it that way and he could configure it to work.”

“But,” said the CFO, “You said it couldn’t work.  What can he do to make it work?”

“Nothing.  Again…math.”


In the end Fred said he would “Just deal with it.”  He lasted about eight months and was asked to leave after he spent $7500 at a Vegas strip club with “clients” one night.

Apparently, math was never a strong suit of his.",267,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0AC4EE0>
892,"""Why replace something that is working? Wait it burned down? Can we fix it?""","I saw the other thread about using Dosbox to make a ~20 years old printer run, and it reminded me of this story:

At my current workplace, we previously had a 1960's industrial control system with electro-magnetic relays and mechanical cam timers. Not a single transistor in that system. There was a project to reverse-engineer it years ago to relearn how that system works because no one knew how it worked anymore, but it was cancelled for whatever reason.

For context of what a electro-magnetic relay control system looks like, here's a video of an elevator using that: https://youtu.be/_xjXdjj2m5Q?t=79

That turned out to be a problem when the system caught on fire. Repairing it was deemed impossible due to many of the documentation being missing or damaged. All we had to go off of was knowing how the system should operate, and the operators' various troubleshooting techniques whenever something went wrong. None of the industrial controls vendors were willing to help with repairing the burned down system. I can't blame them because I'd imagine most IT admins would slowly back away if they were asked to help repair a crashed IBM System/360 or IBM 1401 mainframe that had no backups.

Downtime lasted for a few weeks while we were building a new control system and the programming from scratch. Management was breathing down our necks the whole time. The downtime lasted for several weeks.",31,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0AC4F40>
893,WFH laptops devastated by users...,"This is part tale of woe, part Help Desk request, part discussion about devices that are used primarily WFH.

I had a user call in about a few keys on their laptop not working so well. $User is User, $SR is me.

$User: Hey, how's it going! I've noticed a few of the keys on my keyboard don't always work - Shift and a few of the letters on the left, specifically.

$SR: Alright, is this on an external keyboard or the one on the laptop?

$User: The one on the laptop - I've restarted a few times, it's still not working well.

I remote connect, update some drivers, even flash to a previous restore point- it's the same issue, making me think it's something hardware related.

I ask them to bring their laptop in for a swap (and so that I can replace the keyboard). As soon as the user leaves (after testing the new computer), I pull the old one out and...

It is disgusting. I do not say that lightly; it made me nauseous just to look at. This laptop was COVERED in grease, food particles, dandruff, and ash. Every possible crevice on and around the track pad and keys was packed with detritus.

My only regret was not getting a picture; I hosed this thing down so that I could stop gagging.

I've seen this a lot more now that people are WFH; devices come in either gross or totally filthy because they don't have to worry about coworkers seeing them commute on a device covered in grime. It's messed up.

I check the drive..system no problems, but I still can't figure out why her images are all messed up.  Not all of them but quite a few.

I test the thing.. it's working great.  Give it back.  She's loving it even with the different menu.  She calls a few days later (she lives like 2 blocks from me) so I go over.. she's like why is my facebook so big?  She's using chrome.  I look and it's zoomed to like 500 percent.  I show her how to unzoom it.  I'm like how did you do that?

She's like I didn't do anything (she's not stupid when it comes to computers either).  Hmm.  Then she says she's having trouble scrolling sometimes with the track pad.  And she says 'the down arrow doesn't work'.  Hmmm

We go and look at her picassa images and it saves revisions and you can see all the image backups.. they've all been transformed using picasa and saved (something I should have thought of earlier).  

AHA!  No down arrow.. strange zooming.. corrupted images.  Keyaboard is going bad and sending shortcuts to the open window and it's doing all kinds of strange stuff.. just once in a while!

So when she's in picasa or a browser it's zooming or doing some strange image filter that's a keyboard shortcut.

Ordered a new keyboard for her .. 20 bucks off ebay.  Should fix it.  Till then I gave her an external loaner and a mouse.

All these years I'd never seen that one.

cheers

edit: I also cleaned the keyboard a bit but looked  good as it came from the factory.. there were no old cheetos in there.  No obvious spilled coffee goo or anything",22,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0AC5040>
895,How i saved a company business with dosbox.,"Hi.

First and foremost, sorry for any mistakes. I'm not a native English speaker, first time poster here and not caffeinated yet. It's still early in the morning here.

So, back in 2016, i had my ""real"" first job as an it tech. I was already doing some it support in my previous jobs but it was more because I was ""filling the gaps"" rather than a real it job.

I was doing hotline for a company that is selling a software for laboratories. In reality, i was doing all type of IT support depending on which customer was calling.

One day, one of the customer i had a lot of interactions with called me. Since their IT guy was on a sick leave (he got burn out) i was doing more than just support for our software for them. My boss had a deal with them, apparently.

They decided to renew their old computers to newer ones while their IT guy was off. I'm talking throwing some XP SP1 computers for windows 7 computers. Why windows 7 ? They needed computers with a fucking serial/parallel port (don't remember which one of the two) and those were the only with the appropriate ports.

That's where shit went south. My mission ? Make their 20 ish year old printer (a very specific one that prints stuff that gets on the testing tubes) compatible with their new computers. The printer was using serial/parallel.

They used to have a all in one program made by their previous IT guy. A 16 bit program. New computers are windows 7 64 bits. Not even windows pro.

So my first plan was to find some updated program to make that thing work. There should be at least some 32 bit driver right ? Lol. Didn't found any updated single piece of software for that shit. After half a day of searching,i came to the conclusion that i would have to make their old program work.

Luckily for me, i have been in an association that does retro gaming for years by that point. So I thought, ""could that all in one program run in dosbox ??"". 

And it did. Mostly.

It wasn't able to directly communicate with the printer. So, what i ended up doing, was creating a batch file that was running, in command line :

* Their old program into dosbox
* Dosbox ""prints"" in a virtual printer (which is a text file)
* When it's done, the text file gets pushed through serial/parallel to feed the printer
* Printer gets shit done.

And it work. It worked quite well actually. Took me 2 days but it worked.

The printer got replaced a couple months after that because it broke. Oh, well 🤷‍♂️",164,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0AC50A0>
896,Did you know you can install 32 bit Windows on 64 bit hardware?,"The IT department had all been fired and I was part of the new team. 

I was tasked with refreshing basically our whole fleet of machines, since a number of people were using computers from the days of WinXP. The older/low power 64 bit machines I was told to clean up and refresh to use for kiosks, and to send the 32 bit machines to ewaste. So, whenever I got a computer back I'd run a script that would output the version of Windows installed. 32 bit goes to dermo, 64 bit gets refreshed.

It was not until after I had sent a dozen computers with NVMe drives, 16GB RAM, and i7 CPU's to ewaste that I learned:

1. The previous team had done a clean install of Windows
2. Windows 10 has a 32 bit version
3. It is possible to install a 32 bit version of Windows on 64 bit hardware
4. These machines had been clean installed with Win10 32 bit.

Needless to say, I made some changes to my script after this.

Edit: to clarify, the script was looking at the version of Windows installed, and exiting with a message about scraping the machine if it was 32 bit. After I realized this happened I changed the script to look at the CPU",115,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0AC5100>
897,"Non-IT Director tells sysadmin, ""This is a network issue. You don't do network issues. Do NOT touch the network!""","Had a ""fun"" run in with the director of another department yesterday.  She had mentioned to a coworker of mine that she couldn't scan to email from the printer in her office.  I'm the ""printer whisperer"" for our organization, so he asked me to look at it.  I knew from experience that this director won't let me in her department to look at anything without prior permission (they're in an outside locked building filled with PII and she's super protective of her stuff), so I called and asked if I could come over and take a look at her printer.  I explained that I wanted to run a few scan tests and have her or one of her people walk me through the process they use.  That's when the conversation went south:

Director, yelling across the phone: ""This is a network issue.  You don't do network issues.  You're not allowed to handle network issues. Do NOT touch the network!""

I was stunned at her words and tone because:

1. I'm the one in charge of printers.  If something isn't working, I check it out and if I can't handle it, it's moved up to my senior sysadmin and we work on it together so I learn about it.
2. This woman is director of (non-IT-department).  She is equal to my boss, the CIO.  She has no say as to what I can or cannot do or my daily duties, not can she yell at me like that.
3. I'm a freaking SYSADMIN! I deal with network stuff all day.  I'm a Network GOD in my office.

But I played the grown up, told her, ""That's okay, (Director).  I'll speak to (senior sysadmin) and see what is going on.""

I beat her phone call by a minute - just enough time to brief (senior sysadmin) on what was going on.  He was amazed at (director's) attitude. ""You're a sysadmin.  What in the world is she talking about?""

The fun part - her printer problem wasn't a network issue.  The shortcut they're used to pressing on the printer screen had disappeared.  I was able to walk (senior sysadmin) through how to put it back on the printer via our remote system.",319,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0AC5160>

899,Being the tech support person that other tech support companies call as a last resort,"Back in the day I was the golf pro for several computer stores. I had the latest certificates including being a CNE4. (Novel Netware).  I was called in by one store to go to a large law firm.  The problem was that Canada had instituted the Goods and Services Tax which now covered this industry so their billing software had to be updated to add this new tax field.

The problem was that when you ran the update on the 'Server' the server would get about 80% done then the computer would lock up. 

There were several other techs that had visited this law office and their first idea was run the map command. As it turns out this company was using Novell 1.0.0 so the map command didn't exist. Many techs had left recommending that they update the server and the Netware to at least Novell  3.x, the company before they would even touch this company. As an aside,  I had been to this company many times before to fix machines that didn't boot..  People being people when they were bored would open various files i.e. [command.com](https://command.com) into their word processor (Word Perfect), see that it was apparently junk and then SAVE and close and carry on. This was before recent documents existed. The next morning their computer weld not boot.  A simple boot from floppy and sys c: would fix this problem. This was a small guaranteed income stream  until people stopped looking at things they should not have.. If they had just exited without saving they would have been fine.

&#x200B;

Back to the problem at hand.. Tried the update, same result as everyone else.  Rebooted the Netware Server, contacted the developers of this software, they could not reproduce the fault and this was the only reported problem.

The law office was getting desperate as we all know if you don't bill someone you don't get paid so they were rapidly running out of their line of credit.

Going  back to my home programming skills I recalled where I would occasionally exit twice from a program.  which would unload [command.com](https://command.com).

So I ran [command.com](https://command.com) to load another copy into ram ran the update and it worked to completion.  Ran a few checks and closed out the ticket. 

What mad this the most memorable TS experience was having to sue the company that hired me to get paid.",57,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0AC5220>
900,"I'll never forget keyboard shortcuts, saves wasting clients time and gets a good laugh out of.","LTL;FTP

Quick note, I'm new to this and actually had mistakenly posted this here half completed like the moron I am, so in effort to not humiliate myself further, I've instead copy paste this from a notepad so apologies for formatting errors, I will fix what I can.
Additionally, all names are replaced. I didn't actually end up catching the callers name anyway.


I work for an IT company, as in we are the 3rd Party IT. We look after a massive number of clients and as such, as I am the grunt on the main IT desk, I have to answer the phone as though I'm from that clients IT. For example, I work for TechIT (not real name ofc) but if client is Google then I am GoogleIT (ofc we don't have Google, just easy example). Hope this makes sense.

I had a call today from one of our clients and was an amusing call so I wanted to share this. It's not word for word as my memory is horrendous but here's how it (sorta) went.

> $Me: *client company* IT, how may I help?

> $User: Hi there, its $User calling. Listen, I've got a bit of a weird one, not sure if you can help with this.

> $Me: Of course, what's the issue?

> $User: So, looking to maybe log a call with IT. I'm not at the station right now to check but one of my colleagues is having issues with the second monitor, just says NO DISPLAY FOUND.

> $Me: Ok, I assume your colleague has checked all cabling and such?

> $User: Yes, funnily enough I used to work in IT so I had a look into it myself but cause I'm not physically there, she wasn't comfortable going through Control Panel herself.

> $Me: Ahh I see, that's not a problem, give me just a second to open a ticket.

At this point, it's dawning on me that he's only mentioned Control Panel as a method. There is, as most will know, Windows+P as a keyboard shortcut. 
I sat for a few seconds debating whether to mention this or not, the guy seemed pretty chill on the call with me but I have had people in the past just all of a sudden snap for no reason and I didn't want to sound like I was insulting his knowledge, given the fact he mentioned he was also former IT too.

In the end, I decided to bring it up anyway in the off chance I could save him waiting for however long the Tech team takes to get back to him and brought it up.

> $Me: Just a thought, while I raise this, did you by any chance try the Windows+P command on the keyboard, cause I know that bypasses Control Panel and brings the menu to extend the display right there.

> $User: ...

*Me thinking in my head for that brief 2 second pause: Oh god, this is it...*
> $User: I can't believe I didn't think of that, all the time I spent in-

*Oh thank god, seems like it's going to be fine..*

> $User: -IT, I completely forgot about that, of course.

> $Me: Honestly, don't worry about it, I didn't even know it was a thing until I myself started working in IT, a lot of people tend to forget this shortcut exists.

> $User: Nah, that's brilliant, listen, what I'll do is call her back and ask her to do that, saves having to raise a support ticket and wait for the Tech team to get back to me.

> $Me: Of course, that is not a problem.

Basically after this there were a few pleasantries exchanged and a thank you before the call disconnected. He did say he'd call back if there were further issues but if he did, was after my shift ended or he got one of my other colleagues.

Considering most of the clients I talk to look down on me from their marble thrones, this guy was one of the most genuine calls I had today and the encounter made me smile. Great end to my shift.

901,How I quit my first job as tech support,"I quit a gig as tech support after a particular customer where I was called on a Saturday morning because the laptop was completely dead.
Laptop was stationary and I knew the customer was well known for being unreasonably rude as well as willfully ignorant with thech (managed to destroy 2 keyboards within months by ""typing"").
I was woken up by the call and while still trying to figure out where, who and how I was tried to guide the customer trough basic troubleshooting.
Is there any sign of led light being on, fan spinning, hdd spinning, press power button for 5s, is the power brick plugged in, does the power brick feel warm, are all cable connections solid and plugged in? 
All of the questions were answered in the negative in increasingly rude and aggressive manner.
Finally decided to drive there. My hourly rate was 10$ back then... don't ask I was  young desperate and thought the guy I worked for would actually teach me valuable skills in the process. The other catch? I was only being payed for time spent with the customer or on their machines not for traveling.

1,5hrs later I arrived with a full set of tools, equipment, spare powerbrick and even a replacement laptop in case the old one committed Sudoku.
Customer was pissed that I ""took this long"". Again I want to reiterate that it was Saturday now 9am...
After going over the routine checks myself the customer got even more mad claiming ""I allready checked that"" you told me on the phone! ""do something! "" it's all your fault! Etc...
I tried to ignore her (yes, it's exactly what you think the woman was the typical stereotype of a self important Karen).
After 5min I checked the laptop and could not find any signs of life whatsoever so I checked the powerbrick, suprisingly it was plugged in and warm... Then it hit me as I checked the Other side where the cable leading to the laptop was plugged in... Naturally it wasn't!
Cable management was nonexistent under her desk and between 3 PCs and about a quarter ton of paperwork on and under the desk with equal amount of dust she or one of her numerous cats and little kids  that had access to the office must have accidentally unplugged it...

Plugged it back in, laptop works again. 10minutes of work that could have been avoided if the customer actually did what I asked and actually answered my questions truthfully instead of ignoring them and simply saying ""no"" every time...

In the end I received a whopping 10 bucks, spent 3,5 hours of driving, 20$ on gas and the better part of a Saturday on a lose cable.


Needless to say I don't work for this particular company anymore. I did however take over several of his clients that were friendly and respectful and needed continued support. It turned out after he hired me he fired every other tech he had in the area and was now unable to provide service to anyone in half the state...

This particular story was just the last straw in a long line of particularly frustrating assignments including things like being forced to drive 2hrs to a customer to ""install a new wireless keyboard"", driving 3hrs to a customer to install an apple docking station (on a windows laptop...) and ""fix"" a broken mouse at the aforementioned ladys office (aka insert the battery's in the right direction) all the while being only payed for the actual labor not the time spent on the road.

902,End user tries to repair swollen battery… without a new battery,"A little bit of backstory: I work in tier 2 desktop support for a large enterprise and we have a leasing and service contract with one of the larger PC manufacturers.

Basically, one day I’m working on some random virtual machine issue, when I get an escalation from a tier 1 team for a user that has a swollen battery. This model is absolutely notorious for batteries doing this and it’s about 50% of our work orders for these devices, so I assume it’s a run-of-the-mill repair case. I start opening the vendor’s business support site and start creating the case. Little did I know, this case would never be submitted.

The end user comes on the line and we exchange pleasantries, then we get down to business—how bad is the swollen battery, and does he have pictures? He tells me the battery is really swollen, and he tried to fix it, but wasn’t able to. I was quite confused, as you can’t really fix a swollen battery without just replacing it. I ask him to clarify and he begins to clam up and backpeddle a bit, but he knows I’m on to him. I ask him to send a picture of it, and he sends me a picture with the laptop entirely disassembled, and he had removed the battery and put it in rice because he thought that would fix it?

Needless to say, this was definitely a violation of the service agreement and the device was basically written off after that, seeing as he had done quite a number on the hardware.

903,Remember the basics...,"Something not so funny just happened and I thought I'd share.

So, I'm gearing-up for a job interview over Teams, start up the new computer, and... no boot.

I do get a small underscore symbol on the screen after several seconds, but no BIOS or other indication of life.

This is a new system, with a known weak power supply, and the weather has been really hot, so I'm thinking that's probably it. The weird thing is that it was running fine when I shut it down a few days before. I have well over 30 years of computer troubleshooting experience, so I start with the basics first:

Move RAM DIMM #2 to #1 position... no change.

Swap the video card with a low power unit... no change.

Call my friend to see if he has a power supply I can borrow for testing... and he has one! I go get it and it doesn't connect as it's too old (obsolete connectors.)

Interview time, so I grab the 'ole backup laptop and at some point the wireless flakes-out, then the battery dies during the interview with almost no warning. We reschedule for several hours later. Damn, not a good look so far.

Back to the new system troubleshooting... F' it, off to BestBuy to get a replacement power supply.

Get it home, hook it all up, uninstalled, and BINGO! Got Boot! SWEET!

Re-assemble the entire system, turn it on, no boot, same symptom! WHAT?!?!?

Loose connection? Bad wire? WHAT COULD IT BE?

I disconnect everything except for a single monitor, turn it on and... GOT BOOT! HuH?

Then it hits me like a ton of bricks, and I feel so, so, stupid.

What is the very FIRST thing we ask everyone to check when they state that their system suddenly won't boot?

Say it with me now... ""Do you have any USB drives plugged-in?""

Well did I? Yep, sure did! A new bit of software for my Mustang tuning project, arrived a few weeks ago. I had just forgotten that it was there, and since I almost never shut the system down, I never had a boot problem until now.

I guess now I have a more reliable power supply, and a spare!

I'm just really, really, glad that nobody saw this happen... Now I have to make up a complicated excuse to tell the wife ;-)",43,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0AC56A0>
904,"expensive parts, but don't send them back to the depot!","Way back in my younger days I was a supervisor for a bunch of remote service techs.   We supported various mini computers, peripherals, printers, data communications equipment, basically anything a customer wanted.  

One of our customers started experiencing intermittent issues with a disk drive.  This was the old days when disk drives were large rack mounted units connected to the disk controller by a couple of cables.  This customer had a bunch of disk drives so there was a whole forest of cables between the two racks.

Our local tech spent two days troubleshooting the problem, slowly replacing interface cards in the disk controller, the disk drives, and various cables.  Finally, after he changed out 3 or 4 cables the problem was solved, but he wasn't sure which cable or cables had been the problem.  

I was talking to him on the phone, now that the problem was solved and we had time to review, and he mentioned that he was bundling up all the parts he had used in troubleshooting to send back to us.

We always did this various logic and interface boards, but cables were expendable.  Conversation went something like this:

Me:  Is there a large trash can near you?

Tech:  Yeah, there's one across the room.

Me:  Gather up ALL the cables and dump them in that trash can.

Tech:  But, aren't they expensive?   Don't you want to test them and see if some are good and go back into stock?

Me:  And what happens when the problem is intermittent, and we test them, and put them back on shelf, and some other tech gets them and they don't work?  And he spends days trying to figure out what's wrong?

Tech:  Oh.  OK, but don't they cost like $100 each?

Me:  Yes.  So what?  What's your time and the customer's uptime worth?

Tech:  Ah, I get it.

905,User had one Job...,"(Disclaimer: ~~Englisch~~ English is not my native language)

One of our customers calls, their mobile phones (connected to their own local telephone system) don't work. Well, I had a look at it and indeed- the mobile phones were all disconnected.

So I tried to reach the master DECT base which manages all the other bases (the bases are responsible for connecting the mobiles to the telephone system) - nope. Not reachable. It has to be restarted by unplugging it.

Our documentation for that customer is.. let's say, not complete. Since I couldn't tell them what exact device to restart, I advise them to restart all of them. And they had to locate the (3-4) bases themselves. I remoted into one of their computers and showed them the exact device that they have to unplug and how to do it. The customer said ok, i will do that and call you back.

It took about 15min, then they called back... this it where it gets stupid.

Me: hello, this is <company>, me speaking

C: yeah, we restarted the devices you showed us. Except one, it was placed very high up, but there was another white device right next to it which we could reach. So we restarted that.

Me: (what?) ... ok

I decided against telling them, that what they did was borderline stupid.

Anyway, I tried reaching the master base and I could connect again to restart the slave bases. The bases restarted just fine and everything worked afterwards.

But why? Why, in the love of god, can't you just call me if you can't reach the base to restart it? Yeah, seems logic to just unplug some other device, like I've never shown you exactly what to do.

906,A tale of server repair from long ago... (long),"If you don't want a history lesson in what a PITA it was to configure 2-node redundancy 20-some years ago, skip to paragraph 4. 

Today if you want redundancy, it's easy.  You build your Hyper-V/VMware/XenServer/whatever cluster and off you go.  Back in the day, it was considerably more difficult.  In this instance, the year was sometime around 1999 I'd guess.  My client was a very large metropolitan newspaper and specifically the advertising department.  Now, the ad designers all used Macs back then because Photoshop and Illustrator didn't run on anything else.  Corporate IT being corporate IT didn't want anything to do with the Macs, so the advertising department contracted with my company for support.  One of our other guys dealt with the Mac stuff, but I managed the servers.  Now, this is before Apple brought out their short-lived Xserve line and also before Macs really spoke TCP/IP.  They wanted a server that ran on AppleTalk and back then, the way to do that was with Novell Netware running AppleTalk and the Mac namespace on the volumes.  So, we were running Netware 4.11 on Compaq ProLiant 4500Rs.  

The redundancy back then was all hardware.  Essentially, we had two identical servers with local drives that had the operating systems.  Then there were external storage systems with special backplane cards that allowed SCSI connections to each server.  Once each server was set up to boot Netware, they were both configured in BIOS in this redundant configuration with one server (the one plugged into port 1 on each storage system) being the primary and the other secondary.  There was one other piece of hardware to make this work...a serial cable between the two servers.  Once configured, the primary server would boot as normal and mount volumes from the external storage and go on its merry way.  The secondary server would POST, count memory, then immediately go into a loop in POST where it would monitor the primary server.  If it decided that the primary server was not responding, it would send a signal to every storage system connected and a switch on each storage system backplane would operate, switching the connections to the secondary server.  Once that switch was complete, the secondary server would complete POST and come up looking just like the primary server.  You would then repair the primary server.  Unfortunately, the only way to get things back to square 1 with the primary servers working was to power everything off and back on.  

OK, I told you all of that to tell you this.  My newspaper client had this setup and one day, the client's sysadmin calls up to say that the backup server isn't responding.  When it was working properly, it would flash a message every 5 seconds or so to ""press F8 to switch now"" or something where you could manually initiate the failover.  However, it was just hung up on it.  I had him just restart the server and it cleared the problem up.  For a few days.  When it came back, I went out to take a look and ended up doing the standard setting of dipswitch 6 to clear NVRAM that was the first thing support would tell me to do.  That didn't fix the problem as it came back a couple days later.  

I then called support (did you try clearing NVRAM?) and after some diags, we ended up replacing a part (maybe an array controller).  That didn't fix it so we replaced another couple parts.  Of course, each attempt was separated by a few days for the server to hang up again, so eventually I just brought the server back to my office.  By this time, the ticket had been elevated to the highest support group at Compaq.  Over the next several days, we replaced pretty much every major part that could have been replaced and had not resolved the problem.  Finally, my support guy activated the nuclear option.  He sent me one of every single part that went into building the server other than the case.  System board, array controllers, floppy drive, cables, power supplies, power switch...everything.  He had me completely rebuild the entire server all at once from Compaq spare parts.  (in case you're wondering why they didn't just send a new server, this was a discontinued model that my client maintained support on).  After the full rebuild, the server worked fine.  I've said for many years that the worst thing that can happen when you're faced with an issue is that you never fix the problem.  The second worst thing is that you fix the problem, but don't know how or why.  By this point, I was satisfied that it was working and we never had any similar problems.",26,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D09BBF40>

Whilst checking each desk, I reached Bob. Bob looked at me and asked me what I was doing. I explained I was trying to find the old computers to have them replaced.

With a loud bang, everything fell down to the tarmac a floor below. He then looked at me and said: ""You can start immediately here with placing the new computers.""I was quite stunned. My reply: ""I can't. I was just checking where the replacements needed to go. The new systems don't come in for a few days.""Now Bob is stunned: ""Why didn't you tell me!""Me: ""I didn't really get a chance""Bob looks out the window... ""Then get me a replacement anyway, so I can continue working""Me shakes head and just walks away, leaving an angry Bob behind, and trying to figure out how to explain this mess to my boss.

Bob decided to complain to my boss about not having a computer to work on. Boss luckily didn't care and after getting all stories and checking the wreckage herself, she informed Bob that, not only had he willingly destroyed his old system, his system was not even supposed to be replaced. It was one of the computers the company had hired.

Bob had to wait for 3 days before receiving a new rental computer (similar to what he had before). He also had to pay quite a lot of money for the wrecked rental computer (company insurance didn't cover it). But, he did have a sense of humor. As he claimed he now paid for the old system and that it was his own now, parts of the old computer, such as the motherboard, were nailed to the wall in his office up to the day he retired. He used a rail-spike sized nail to keep it on the wall.",33,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D09BBFA0>
908,"Floor it? No, don't floor it. Floor it? No, don't floor it. OKAY FLOOR IT!","So I work for a contracted company as 1st level support mixed and we do the typical resets and downloads for VPN access due to remote users still having to work from home. 

We will call this company the HAAC just to really hide myself.

A common ticket we run into is the VPN access, simple AD permission and we email them a link with the VPN software and a document on how to setup the VPN on their own. 95% of users can follow these both by reading without any issues. There are some who need more assistance which are the 4% and then the 1% are the users who really, really, really struggle with reading the documentation. 

Now that the stage has been set, lets get to our 1% user who has issues with connecting to the VPN. 

Me: ""Happy accidents abortion clinic, no mistakes in life just happy accidents, help desk. How can I help you today?""  
User: ""Hi, I need VPN setup on my computer, I was told to call this desk""  
Me: ""Sure thing, can I get your network credentials for verification on who you are?""  
User: ""Okay, it is: \[redacted\]""  
Me: ""Just a moment please"" que the search of the AD account.   
Me: ""Alright, I just found you now lets get you setup""  
User: ""Sweet, can you walk me through it?""  
Me: ""No need, we have a document if you want to go at your own pace. It is pretty solid and is verified by the CTO""  
User: ""Oh great thanks!""  
End call 1

I email the link to the download for the VPN and send over our step-by-step guide on how to download in separate emails due to potential filtering in the exchange server and Symantec.

Fast-forward 20 minutes, the user calls back.

Me: ""Happy accidents abortion clinic Help desk, this is u\\Thine\_Captain, how can I help you today?""  
User: ""Hi I called earlier and one of the help desk people sent me some links on setting up my vpn.""  
Me: ""Oh okay, I believe we spoke earlier, are you running into any issues with the setup?""  
User: ""Yes, I click the link in the document you sent and the website is not working""  
Me: ""Oh my mistake, let me take a look""  
I check the link in the document, it is just for the MFA setup, but she should not need it since she got the enrollment email and it says she set it up.   
Me: ""Alright, it appears that you already set it up.""  
User: ""No I didn't, i clicked download and its not setting up""  
At this point I realize she means the VPN download and not the MFA app.  
Me: ""Okay, let me remote in to take a look""  
One quick assist session later\~  
Me: ""Alright lets see here, it appears that you have downloaded it multiple times now. You don't need to download it again.""  
User: ""Oh you want me to do it again, but it didn't work""  
Me: ""No, don't download it""  
User: ""Download it again?""  
Me: Firmly, ""No, don't download it""  
User: ""Okay, I'll download it""

It was an honest enactment of Mrs.Puff and SpongeBob saying Floor it and No Don't floor it. 

the user proceeds to click the download link roughly five times, for a grand total of 20 downloads and clicks one link and notices that it starts to install.   
I stick with the user for about 20 more minutes and find out that she registered her work phone for mfa, big no no for us due to the phone systems not having the ability to receive the short mfa calls (idk never cared to ask why, im a contractor not a cop).

We finally get to the login with MFA and she is able to get on. She tells me:  
User: ""I was just following the document, I am not sure what happened.""  
Me: ""Can you show me which one you were talking about that I sent?""  
User: she pulls up the email, first with just the download link, not acknowledging the one sent immediately after with documentation.  
Me: ""Ma'am this is not the documentation. I mentioned earlier that there would be two emails coming.""

909,Sometimes the simplest solution isn't what you think it is,"I work as support for a school with interactive whiteboards connected to a Windows 10 host in every classroom. Some of the boards are old - about I decade I think - and the newest one was bought earlier this year. They're terribly expensive so it's simply not possible to buy new boards to keep them all at the same the spec.

Now the boards work well for the most part, but from time to time I need to re-calibrate,  re-install a driver, or perform the good old-fashioned ""turn it off and on again"".

Today a teacher called me into her classroom complaining that the board wasn't responding and that her mouse was going crazy. Now as a general rule the first thing I do when I get a ticket from a teacher is to make sure it isn't a user error, and though this teacher is older and less tech-savvy, the board was definitely behaving strangely. I went thought the troubleshooting steps, trying the simplest solution first: is it powered? Yes. Is it communicating with the PC? Yes (most of the boards have an LED to show this). Okay, let's power cycle...still no joy.   
I figured then it might be a driver issue. When I got to the PC, I saw that again teacher wasn't over-reacting: the mouse cursor was bouncing around in the corner like the mouse had been placed on a glass table. So now, before I could reload the drivers for the board, I had to get the mouse working.   
Trying again the simplest and easiest solution first, I re-seated the USB plug. No change. I fetched a spare mouse and plugged it in - still the same.  Different USB port? Nope. So drivers then? I reinstalled the mouse drivers - nothing - and the USB hub drivers - still the same problem. 

It was then that I decided to turn to faithful uncle Google, though I was fairly certain I'd need to replace the PC and have a decent look at this one. The very first link I clicked said something like ""This can happen with touchscreens...blah blah blah...touching the screen..."" and I could kick myself. Before even looking up I knew what I was going to find.  The teacher had placed a display board on the ground in front of the class, with the upper corner touching the lower corner of the whiteboard. All this time the mouse was reacting to the interactive whiteboard, and the board was simply registering the touch of the display board.  I laughed out loud at myself for taking 10 minutes to solve a 10 second issue, and the teacher and children got a good giggle out of it, too. 

At least now I know what the *actual* simplest solution is when diagnosing a whiteboard-and-mouse issue.",48,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D09BD0A0>
910,Coated Server," 

Long time ago, the company I worked for, had it's nearest official tech-support on the other side of the country. Since I had some knowledge of computers, and had access to pretty much the entire office, they called me whenever anythign needed to be done in the office. Saved them travel-time, kept my job even more fun... win-win.

Server was in a room which also included several archives, across the hall from the secretaries of the engineering-department.

At some point, servers crashed. I get a call to check up on it. I arrive at the server-room, and check everything. Everything looks normal. Server restarts, everything is working. The tech-support monitoring stated that server went down due to overheating, but it now runs smoothly again.

Few hours later, same thing happens. Next morning, again. At this point, I've had enough, bring over a spare air-co, set it on cold and close the room. It still didn't help. Around noon, again, server overheating and shutting down. Tech-guy travels all the way to the office and we are both going step by step to figure out what the problem is.

Whilst we are trying to figure out the issue, one of the secretaries comes in, surprised we still haven't got the server running again, hangs up her fur-coat ON the server and heads to her desk. Leaving us both staring in disbelief at what had just happened.

Turned out, she had a nice new coat, and since some things had gone missing before at the desk, she had seen the server-room as the best place to keep it. It was locked after all, and only a handful of people had access to it cause of the archives. There were a few hooks on top of the server, and she found those perfect as a coat-hanger, not realising it blocked airflow to the fans keeping the server cooled.

When the server went down, she couldn't do her regular work, so she would get her coat and go for a walk. Coming back after everythign was running again.

Access to the server-room was after that further restricted, with only the office-manager and me having access to the room. Everyone else had to contact us if they needed to enter that room for the archives.

(I still wonder why no-one ever moved those archives to a different room)",35,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D09BD100>
911,Sometimes we all make mistakes..,"This story comes from a few years ago when I was still working in the law field.

It was right after the Christmas. The office was still pretty empty but there were a few attorneys there. Most of the office took a holiday vacation, coming back after the new year.

I get to work and sit down. I immediately get a call from one of the users sitting directly across from my office. Must have seen me come in I guess. I answer, and they say to me ""Nothing is coming up on my screen."" I guess I don't even get a few seconds to myself before I start my day. Whatever, I could use some coffee anyway.

I head over there and take a look. They look exhausted. They're sitting a their desk, staring at the screen with a dead look and hitting random keys on their keyboard in hopes the screen will come up.

I take one look at them, then look to my left and notice an empty docking station. I calmly pointed to the empty dock and said ""that might be your problem."" They slowly get up and look at the dock, followed by long sigh and a ""God damn it.."" We had a chuckle and I went on my way.

It's Monday, and I didn't want to be there. I decided to not take that extra vacation day so I could make some extra progress on a project. I could have started bitching about them, and how stupid they were. But its early and I had just spent 3 minutes trying to unlock my office door by hitting the ""unlock"" button on my car keys.

At least I had my coffee.",59,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D09BD160>
912,This is why you always disconnect your tech gear before lightning strikes.,"Hi all! Long time lurker, first time poster. I don't work in tech support, but I am my family's go-to tech support guy, so I have a few stories to tell. TL;DR on the bottom in case you're lazy and don't want to read the entire thing.

So, back in January, I installed a Google Mesh system in my parent's home, so they could have better network coverage in their house as the ISP-provided router wasn't powerful enough to cover the entire house. The Mesh system is of the 2nd gen Google WiFi system (not the newer Nest Wifi stuff).

Now, if you don't know how a mesh network is set up, you have one main router and several access points which relays the connection around the house. They all wirelessly connect to each other and provide a stable and reliable connection around the house you set the points up in, as long as you set them up within reasonable range. In our case, we had the main point in my dad's office directly connected to the ISP router and two relays placed in the hallway and in the living room. This system worked perfect and was pretty reliable......up until this story.

One morning I wake up to something like 7 or 8 missed calls from my mom. Apparently that morning, there had been a few powerful lightning strikes in the area where they live, and the power was all out for a while until my dad hooked up the power generator to the house. However, when they got everything back up and running, they noticed there was no network in the house at all. So I started going through all the usual troubleshooting steps I could before I had to go to work (which wasn't really that much). Check everything's connected properly both on the main router and the mesh system. Check if my dad has a wired connection to his desktop. Check our file server for network connection. And finally - reboot absolutely everything. Router, mesh - everything that has to do with the network. Once it all was back up and running again, Still nothing. So I started thinking the main line into the entire village that provides the ADSL network for the village could be shot or maybe a base station. So I checked the ISP status page for any eventual line disconnects or errors - which I found none. So I told my parents to just live off cellular connection as much as possible for the day before I headed to work then we'd look more into it when I got back home.

Later that day, I got a call from my mom and was told that apparently, some techs that work for a contractor company our ISP uses just out of nowhere contacted my dad and told him they would come up to their house and replace their main modem as they had apparently seen some irregularities. How the hell they were able to see that, I have no idea, but I had figured earlier that day that the modem probably was shot since I never saw any errors on the ISP status page. So my dad somehow managed to set up the ISP router himself with the correct settings, and the main network went back up. However, it wasn't really working as it should.

So, as I said, I installed a Google Mesh system in their house so they would have proper connection all around the house. However, from that morning, the Mesh network didn't work at all. They asked me a few times throughout the week what the issue could be but the little troubleshooting I was able to do earlier in the week never really told me anything. We checked connections, rebooted.. Nothing worked.

For information - I live 5 hours away from my parents by car, and I don't have a car, so it wasn't really an option to get to their house and do the troubleshooting myself, so this all had to be done over the phone which is hard enough when you work with IT-competent people, but even harder when you talk with someone who doesn't really know much more than the basics to operate their computer and smartphone on a day to day basis.

So this morning, we went haywire on getting the mesh network back up and running as well as figuring out what in the fuck actually brought it down in the first place.

The first thing we did was the usual text book stuff. Reboot, check connections. All that simple stuff. After all that was done and we still were stuck with the same result, it hit me. Every router has some sort of status LED that lights up in all kinds of colours to indicate the status of the router. In the case of these Google WiFi points, it's the following:- White for Everything's okay- Blinking blue for both working and ready for setup- Solid blue for factory reset in progress- Blinking Orange for No Connection- Blinking Red for when something's wrong with the router. This hit me way too late so out of nowhere, I pulled up the Google Support page that shows what the colors mean before I ask my dad ""What color is the front LED on the router?"". To my unexpected surprise, I get back ""Umm... It's blinking Orange.."" At this point, I just smashed my head in the desk and immediately had an idea of what the issue could be. So I immediately told my dad to go downstairs and grab one of the two Mesh points I had put there and bring it upstairs. After five minutes, we had a new point upstairs in my dad's office connected and powering on. Wouldn't you guess it - It got a connection right away. It also was 10x quicker at starting up. This immediately confirmed my suspicion.

What had happened was the lightning that fried our main router, also managed to fry parts of the motherboard in the Google Wifi point that was directly connected to the router with a cable. Therefore, the ethernet in port was fried and the router didn't receive any network signal in. So what we had to do was reset the entire mesh network, set up one of the other routers as the main router and the two others as relays again in the same positions and voila, it all was up and running again.

Now, even tho we got it all back up and running, I have set up a warranty case with Google to see if we can get this replaced. But until then, the partially dead point serves as the hallway mesh point.

So moral of the story - if you know there's gonna be any sort of lightning in your area, please make sure to disconnect any network equipment that is critical and could be killed easily if lightning strikes.

TL;DR: Parents left network equipment connected during some lightning in their area - ends up with little to no network for about a week.

913,And that's how you invalidate your service agreement!,"It's time for another tale from the Petrol payment processing server industry!  
You can read my prior story [The Screams From The Server Closet](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/oa3lx1/the_screams_from_the_server_closet/) here!

It's late on a Saturday and I'm trying to wind down into the last half hour of my shift, when I get it, the call you don't want to get when you're trying to get out of the door. Call comes in, and not only does the site not really know how to explain what they did clearly (ESL caller), they don't know WHY they did it, all I can really get out of them is that after a power outage they can't run any cards.

After some back and forth getting their service ID, verifying what equipment of ours is on their site, and what contracts we have with them, I start probing to see where it hurts, that's when I get the full story. The site came back up from the power outage and their POS and Commander (server) were back up and running, but they couldn't do any financial transactions.

Do they call us? No. Do they submit an online support request? Nope. What did they do?

They unplugged every ethernet cable out of the router, and jammed them back in at random, without noting what was where and where they put them. I look out at the setting sun from the office window and realize it may be a while before I get home to eat dinner.

First thing I do is shoot a message to one of my T3 specialists, because part of our SOP is to run situations like this by them. The reply to my teams message is, in verbatim: ""HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA"".  
And then my T3 sends me a snippet of the KB on 'things that invalidate your service contract', with 'unguided attempts at self repair' highlighted.

I let the site know that we won't be able to dispatch for this one, and that they, in nicer words, fucked up. They don't fight me, but I'm just talking to a cashier, and they usually leave the snarling for their management. I do want to get this resolved, but I can't see what's plugged into where because I'm hundreds of miles from them, and we can't connect to the site because the WAN1 port has some other random ethernet cable jammed into it.

So I call their Managed Network Service Provider to see if they can see.. well.. anything. I tell the router tech guy what happened, and his immediate response is ""HAHAHAHAH Oh wow.""

We end up walking the site through tracing cables together and trying to get the router talking to their ISP so we can log in and see.. anything, but the site is just so clueless about anything to do with tech and there are some blatant language issues that are making it harder. Router tech ends up escalating to the site's parent company XYZ Petrol, to get them to dispatch an on-site tech, which they'll likely be fined for, and until that's resolved, we can't do anything for them, because ""ETHERNET GOES IN ANY PORT, RIGHT?""

Anyways, the site learned a very expensive and painful lesson today, and won't be able to do literally anything but cash transactions for maybe.. days? With that, I promptly fled the building before my luck got any worse.

914,Boss Installed a New Timecard System Without Telling Me,"This is my second post here and again, I'm not Tech Support, but I was ""that guy"" who had to handle everything tech related *before* we bothered to call (and pay for) our actual Tech Support vendor, who was an old friend of the owner and while his service was top-notch, we were his smallest client and his working for us was a personal favor, so we tried not to bother him....

....anyway I was also the Office Manager and the owner/boss blindly bought some new software to put on everybody's computer to ""make it easier"" for our 10 employees to log in their start and stop times for the day. Evidently using a simple Excel sheet wasn't easy enough that he had to spend about a grand on this program for every computer. Ends up he didn't run it by me or by our Tech Support guy before purchasing this software. I expressed my concerns, well mostly about how this wasn't really needed with such a small office, but evidently the owner was concerned that his employees might be ""fudging their timecards"" and this was the magic fix. Again, I thought it was a bit of overkill for such a small office. These programs ran on individual computers and not on our server, which got me thinking.....

I logged into my computer, looked at the time clock and clocked in using the new software. Then I just changed my computer's clock time and sure enough, I could clock out showing I had worked eight hours! A few minutes later and I already had my 40 hours done for the week and I hadn't even had my Morning coffee! I printed off my timecard and handed it to the boss and told him I'd see him next week.

Of course I didn't actually leave, but I did manage to get him to have our Tech Support remove the software and get a refund....",161,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D09BD280>
915,User desperately needs access to VPN,"A couple weeks ago my inbox notification went off and I dutifully checked my email. Someone had sent an email to all IT administrators in my company. This person's email went roughly like this, ""I have been emailing the helpdesk for 2 weeks now that I need access to the VPN and no one has helped me. Can you please help?!"" the person's boss was also CCed in this email.

My Teams notification suddenly goes off and it is the CCed boss asking me to please call her as her employee needs VPN assistance and it is very important that this employee has access as soon as possible.

I am not the helpdesk tech. I am the systems admin. I decide to ignore the boss for now and I log into the helpdesk to see what is going on. I do a search for the user....no open tickets. I refine the search for any tickets ever from this user....no tickets. None open, none closed, none pending. Nothing. This user has never emailed the helpdesk.

I still want to help, and I know the helpdesk tech is a busy person so I email the user and CC the boss. My email says roughly this, ""Hey user. I checked the ticket system and I didn't see any tickets, so I want to make sure you are emailing [helpdesk@company.com](mailto:helpdesk@company.com). Regardless, let me help you get set up. So we are in the process of switching to a new VPN system. I've created an MFA account for you and you should have an email from the MFA system in your inbox now. Please follow the steps it prompts to complete step 1 of the new VPN. You'll need to download the CISCO client and configure that as well. We don't have instructions written for that yet, so please call me at 555-1122 or reply to this email and I can schedule a meeting with you and I'll be glad to walk you through the process of completing the setup. Warmest regards.""

The rest of the day goes by. No email, no phone call from the user. I checked in the admin section of the MFA software and saw that the user had completed the setup and had configured a phone number. Alright, great! They've completed step 1. Now they just need to call me and I can get them the CISCO VPN software, provide them the URL and help them get into the VPN. They just need to contact me with an ideal time for them.

One week later.....

I get an automated email alert that the user has locked themselves out of the MFA for too many bad authentications.

Another week has gone by and I still have not gotten a call or an email from the user. They still have not emailed the helpdesk at all. I check up on it every couple days. Maybe someday they will finish reading my email and follow my directions. Maybe not. But I'm not chasing them down. I'm curious to see how long it will take. In the meantime they still do not have access to the VPN. I wonder how they are doing their job.

The user's boss has not contacted me again either. The only other people in the IT admins email group are the helpdesk guy and my boss. I asked them both if they've been contacted by the user and both have said no, they saw my email and they were letting me handle it. I told them I haven't heard back from the user and they just shrugged and said, ""well, he's been given instructions. Let's wait and see.""

We are still waiting.

916,Exceeding expectations by delivering features late,"Another software dev here. Our support people got a request from a business we work with to add a specific feature. It wasn't a simple request.

> ProductOwner: No pressure FinalDevice, but we need to give them an estimate. When do you think it'll be done?

> Me: About 2 months.

Time comes and goes. Feature gets built. It's annoying to test and I made bugs. Feature gets fixed. It's still annoying to test, but there are fewer bugs. Do more fixing. After roughly 2 1/2 months, we deliver the feature. It's a couple weeks late, but I work for a chill company (and the feature request was from a chill client). I figured they'd care more that it works correctly than that it arrives on time.

> BossPerson: Hey FinalDevice, I've been meaning to say thank you! The client is thrilled that you shipped the feature so quickly.

> Me: Awesome, glad they're happy! We missed our estimate though, I'm surprised they thought that was fast.

> BossPerson: Missed? I'm pretty sure we told them 6 months...

Apparently when I told ProductOwner it would take 2 months, she padded it and promised the feature in 3 months. This message was passed to ProjectManager, who padded the estimate and promised the feature in 4 months. This message was passed to BusinessRelationsManager, who padded the estimate and promised the client that we'd deliver in 6 months. At each stage they assumed that whatever estimate they received was probably optimistic (to be fair, I missed my original estimate) and should be padded ""just in case"".

It's just funny because it's the exact opposite of the usual horror story. Most companies you say ""6 months"" and each manager whittles the number down a bit in hopes that it makes them look good.

917,20 mile line of sight,"Disclaimer: I am not a support technician. My parents happen to be the user in this story. Forgive me if any details are wrong.

When I was in high school, my parents decided to build a new house. We lived in a century-old farmhouse, 5 miles from the nearest town, and had line of sight internet. The internet wasn't great, but it was enough for email and online classes.

In order to build the new house, we bulldozed the old house and moved to a town about 20 miles away for a summer. My parents, knowing nothing about technology, took the router and sundry with them. They ended up putting the router in my 2nd floor bedroom window because it was the only way they could get the Wi-Fi to work.

Shortly after we moved, we noticed the internet quality and speed dropping. I was taking a online college course at the time, so we really needed to get it fixed. My mom called the line of sight internet provider and ask them to come check the router. They asked for an address. She gave it. 

When the technician arrived, he took one look at the router and said, ""Ma'am, I'm sorry to tell you this, but you will be losing your internet service. Your little setup here has been dragging down our entire system and baffling our team. You can have your service back when you return to your original address.""

918,The user who restarted too... much,"Today, one of my users had a problem with getting QuickBooks to open a company file over the network, so I went down to her desk. I have no clue what QuickBooks was having problems with, because I just clicked ""open"" and the QB login screen showed up. I started to leave.

At this point, the user mentioned that she has been restarting her computer three or four times a day. (I have problems getting some users to restart once a week.) I asked her why. She said that it was because her dual monitors never came back up correctly when the computer went to sleep. One of them would always be blank, and the desktop icons would end up on the other monitor. In other words, standard Windows difficulties keeping track of a second display.

She thought it was normal to have to restart a computer this often, because it was about 5-7 years old. I told her that no, it is not normal to have to reboot this often, regardless of PC age. I disabled automatic sleep to prevent this from happening in the future, and she was quite happy that she wouldn't have to restart so often.

One of the guys I worked with was from Russia and one of the smartest people I've ever worked with.  His experience in computers involved having to rebuild most systems at a customer's site since the factory just shipped stuff out to make their quotas, no one cared if it worked.  So he was an excellent troubleshooter, down to the component level.  He was our in house tech support guru, let's call him Ivan. 

Some of the items we sold with our systems were computer terminals, which were manufactured by another vendor.  And they frankly were not that great.  My company was in the process of spinning up our own ability to manufacture a new line of terminals but two large sales came up before we were ready, so our old vendor was tasked to build an intermediate model, better than the old ones, not as good as our new and improved models would be.  So they built around 150-200 units, half were installed for a customer in California and half went to a customer in the Eastern US.

We started to get reports of erratic behavior from both customers, basically the display would get scrambled and the terminal had to be be reset (soft reset) but it cleared any work in progress so the customer had to re-enter what they were doing.  We figured out that static electricity was a common cause, a user would walk across some carpet, touch the terminal, and the display would scramble. Sometimes it would happen without anyone touching it at all. 

We kicked this problem back to the vendor and sent some of problem units to them.  They also sent one of their QA techs to the customer's site to see if he could figure it out.  We also sent a couple of units to our engineering group at our manufacturing center.  So, lots of people were working on the problem but no one was working very hard.  The vendor knew we would not be buying anymore terminals from them, so they kind of went through the motions.  Our engineering folks had many problems they were working on, and they knew that we would not have any more of this model coming online so they were not too invested in the problem either.

The customer was really unhappy with how long things were dragging on (months) and was complaining to the sales team, who was complaining to my boss, who was the service manager for the Western US.  He called Ivan and me in and said he wanted us to solve the problem, forget about everyone else who was working on it.  Overtime was authorized for us to work after hours.

Ivan knew way more about digital circuits than I did, but I was around as an assistant.   That evening we pulled one of the units apart so the logic board was exposed but the unit was powered up.  We found we could force the problem by simply touching the microprocessor chip with a metal tool or even a finger (running it along the leads).   We could not believe that an entire load of chips was defective so Ivan was poking around and got the idea that maybe the chip was getting dirty power.  We had an oscilloscope handy and he checked for ripple on the power lead for the the chip, and it looked fine.  However Ivan realized the voltage looked wrong, it should be 5 volts, (I couldn't tell from scale we were using), so we grab a DVM and check the voltage, and its about 4.5 volts.  

Ivan grabbed a catalog we had and looked up the chip, it required 5 volts plus or minus .25 volts, so the power was out of spec.  But the terminal still worked at 95% of the time.  He started checking voltages where the supply connected to the logic board, it was around 4.95 volts.  The power supply was in an external brick, which we opened up and found 5.05 volts (I think, this was almost 40 years ago).  The brick was connected to the terminal by a 6 foot multiple lead cable.  

I was thinking how terrible this was, I had no idea how were going to fix it.  I'm guessing the vendor is going to have to rebuild all the power supplies, or we are.  Ivan just held up a hand and continued reading the catalog and looking into the power supply.  He then announces that the 5 volts is supplied by a specific regulator in the power supply, and the company makes a 6 volt regulator in an identical case, and we'll just swap it and see what happens.  

Next day we went to a local supplier and bought a couple of the 6 volt regulators, rushed back to the office and swapped out the 5 volt for a 6.  The regulator was not even soldered in, it used a socket.  We powered the terminal up and started checking voltages.  We had at least 5 volts everywhere and the terminal display was stable now.  We had another terminal so we did the same thing for it and found it was stable also.  

We wrote up our findings and sent them off to our engineering team.  In the mean time we bought enough 6 volt regulators to upgrade all our customer's units.  We told our local tech to just start changing out the regulators on an ""as needed"" basis and to put a colored sticky dot on each power supply he upgraded.

Then we got a whole bunch of stuff from our engineering team.  They had created a Field Change Order, complete with components, diagrams, forms, and wanted us to use this instead.  We figured their fix would take over an hour per unit to upgrade, ours would take five minutes.  They had included additional wiring to make the voltage adjustable on a unit by unit basis.  Ivan and I talked it over with our boss and decided we'd just proceed with our easy fix and hope no one followed up with us.  

Ivan pointed out that the real problem was the chips were ""too good"".  If they had really required the specified voltage, the problem would have been discovered by the manufacturer and solved before the terminals left the factory.  Of course he was joking, but it was ""kind of"" true.  

Some weeks later I was a party where one of the engineers that worked for terminal manufacturer happened to be.  He and I knew each other pretty well, and I knew he had been one of the team that designed the problem terminal.   I was describing what we had found and how we had fixed it, and he kind leaned back in his seat and rolled his eyes.  I asked him what the problem was and he told me that the original design called for the power supply to be internal to the terminal, so there would not be a 6 foot power lead.  So maybe, everything would have been okay if they hadn't switched to the external brick, which was done since they wanted to use a slimmer case for the terminal.  

At the end of the day the customer was happy, the sales team was happy, and we were happy.  And I got lesson in perfect being the enemy of good enough.",94,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D09BD460>
920,Tales from Gansa,"First of all, sorry for my english, not native speaker.

This situation was a couple of years ago, I worked mantaining and fixing computers, monitors and fiscal printers in a large company that manufactured eyewear such as glasses and contact lenses and that kind of things. There were like 50 diferent stores in all of the provincia (I would say state I guess).

One day I get a call from the cashier in the furthest location we own. I'm talking like 2 hours by car at least from HQ.

Me: Hi, this is IT, how can I help you?

Gansa: Yes, hello, this is Gansa from far away location, we are having a problem with the fiscal printer, is not printing and we don't have ""talonarios de facturacion"" (this is a piece of paper you use to write the receipt by hand in case the fiscal printer is not working)

Me: Ok, let's check the basics first. Is the printer connected to the wall?

Gansa: Yes. I already checked.

Me: Is it on then?

Gansa: How can I tell?

Me: (She uses this 100 times a day and didn't notice the green led?) It should have a green led and a second led blinking constantly.

Gansa: No, I don't see anything.

Me: Ok then, I'm on my way.

I hang up, grab my tools, a new printer (this is a problem because we need to configure everything for that store in particular, we can't just exchange it.), a power cable, a serial cable (Yes, I know, obsolete.) 2 ""talonarios de facturacion"", my car keys, and drive to the store.

\*2:40 hours of fighting traffic I arrive at the store\*

I walk in the store, I speak with the manager and give him the ""talonarios"" and he thank me and I get behind the counter to check the problem.

Took me 4 seconds to know that the printer is not plugged in the wall. But I don't see any socket available. (In this store, we make the counters with the correct ammount of sockets to plug in the essensials alone, the employees have lots of sockets available in the storage room for personal use.)

I checked the only one that doesn't look familiar, and follow the cable. It was a charger for a phone. The cashier unpluged the fiscal printer and connected her phone. I calm myself of the bloody rage that is coursing in my very core and call the manager, I don't speak to him. Just point to the cable and keep pointing uptil I reach the wall. His face was priceless.

Manager: GANSA!!!!!

Gansa (Scared): What?

Manager: Dis you connect you charger to the wall?

Gansa (Clueless): Yes!

Manager: And you had to unplug something to do it?

Gansa: Yes, but everything was working when I unplu... Ohhh.

Me: Yes, about that. Didn't I asked you if the printer was plugged to the wall?

Gansa: Yes, but I did check!

Me: Well, you checked wrong. You know where I work? I came asap from HQ. 2 hours and 30 minutes to get here, and you unplugged the printer to charge your phone! Why didn't you use the storage room for that?

Gansa: ""Mumble something"".

Me: What?

Gansa: I can't see the notifications if the phone is in the storage room...

Me (grabing my things): I'm going to report this to your sales supervisor since is a direct breach of the sales agreement and your contract. You can't tamper with the hardware in the store.

Manager (realizing the fault is also his): I can manage this issue, don't you worry OP.

Me: Yeah, I know how you manage things apparently. I will speak with the supervisor anyway, I have to report this issue in the ticket. Good night.

Without a single word I left the store and went home.

The next day I reported everything in the ticket and sent a mail to the sales supervisor and the sails manager, my manager and the store.

Gansa wasn't fired, but quit a week later, the manager was demoted to cashier and I got one more week of vacations from my manager.

THE END

Thanks for reading and will see you again in the next one!",40,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D09BD4C0>
921,When the errors are not what they seem...,"So I worked as a hardware engineer and this happened about 3 years ago.

Our company developed a tool I'll just call MIW (Making It Work) which was essentially a hardware emulator for real life signals that are expected on a machine another company built. They used our MIWs to test their machines and to make sure that they worked properly before shipping them off. The MIW was just a small aluminium box with a bunch of connectors, so nothing fancy. 

Part of my duties was assembling the MIWs and testing them with Logic Analyzers and Oscilloscopes to make 100% sure that they are outputting the correct signals. I had to write a 4-ish page test certificate for every single module. Gladly we only had to assemble about 20 a year. 

Then something strange happened. Ever more frequently we got some of the MIW units sent back with a repair order, because according to the customer, they were not working. On the report, it always just stated  ""No/Wrong Output"". OK, so I disassembled the units, measured some traces making sure there were no shorts and then fully tested them, writing the full test certificate again. Interestingly enough, all MIWs were perfectly fine. After the fourth or fifth unit sent to us in a single month, we called the customer asking what that all was about since every unit was perfectly fine and within the specs. We asked them to check their connection cables, reminded them of making sure to screw them all into the MIW during testing (some of the connectors were the D-Sub type ones) and they said to check it all.

A week later we get a package from them with another MIW stating the ""No/Wrong Output"" error along with all their connection cables. I was pretty grossed out when I saw them. The isolation was broken all over the place with the small copper wires showing through, grease, dust and other grime covered everything and after cleaning and testing the cables, I did continuity checks on them. I figured out that about 20% of the connections had loose contacts and a few other ones were completely broken. I wonder why it even worked sometimes...

So I rang up our customer, stated everything and asked how to proceed from there on. Should I just repair the old cables (which I didn't recommend at all) or make new ones which could take a few weeks since we hadn't all the necessary parts stocked. They choose the much recommended option two and I ordered all parts, waited for their arrival, made some new ones, tested them and wrote a full report over my findings. I made sure to include a copy of that report with the shipping to our customer as well as a friendly reminder that if they ever have testing problems again, if the new cables look like the old ones, please send us them instead of the MIWs...

We only had to repair one single MIW since then (but had to make two other cable sets). I don't know how they are treating the cables, but to be honest, I *REALLY* don't wanna know...",65,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D09BD520>
922,Hello are you there?,"I'm still green at helpdesk, it has been about a month since I started. Was ona call with a user who could not connect a second monitor to their laptop. During said call User was dead silent, I checked in and no response.... being in the middle of verification steps I did mot want to hang up as I saw the call was still connected, so I reached out again and again and again.

About an hour passes with no progress before I finally ask, ""Did you accidently mute yourself"" turns out he did and he was almost yelling at me to get me to respond. He was about to hang up thibking it was a new phkne issue.

923,We've tried nothing and we're all out of ideas!,"Naively, I thought that some of the PEBKAC stories on here were somewhat uncommon. Naively.

I've sent some brand-new, in-box monitors out for some WFH employees. Of the 10 sent out, 2 of them called in, miffed at the new monitors and requesting new ones.

I'll review one of the calls:

$User is User, and I'm $SR.

$User: I cannot believe this - this thing is broken out of the box!! You have to send a new one out, I bet the mail guy dropped it and broke it.

$SR: Ah, let me remote connect and see what's going on.

Less than a minute being connected, the device does not see the monitor attached.

$SR: Looks like the computer doesn't see it. Does the power button on the monitor have a backlight at all?

$User: I don't think so, yeah, I'm pressing it and it's not changing colors.

$SR: Okay, the monitor - is it plugged in to the wall?

$User: No?? That's not a thing, my USB monitor plugged right into my computer!!

$SR: Oh, it's a thing. Do you have the extra cable from the original box?

$User: No.

$SR: ...

This sums it up, really. I've had my first call in a long time that made me literally face palm. Happy Monday!

924,What is wrong with my CPU one thread is .1 degree is higher than the other,"This happened way back in 2016.

I used to be the lead tech in a company in the north of scotland. To a custom computer builder and we were having an event to show off some of the projects that we had made (wish I had kept the phone with these msg on it).

So here we go.

I am talking with a entitled guest (EG) who has turned up at the event and he is telling me that he is looking for custom pc. We go through what he wants and I go through my protfolio on the builds we have done as well as show him all the overclocked gaming pc. I show off all the prices on an excel spread sheet. EG looks at it and says ""well I could build it for alot less"" (DUH of course he can as I dont work for free) and then goes on (EG) ""You get parts alot cheaper than I get as your a buisness"". I sigh ""We are a custom builder and we dont make enough computers to get a bulk discount"" (plus in the tech industry it dosent work like that). I appologies and wish him well. I thought all is well and that was the end of it. (WRONG!!!)

The EG begins to send me texts and it goes as follows.

EG: Are you free.

Me: Sure whats up.

EG: I built a system that I was talking about with you

Me: Cool how is it going

EG: There is something wrong with it 

Me: Oh that is not good so what is wrong with it.

EG: the CPU its overheating. 

ME: Shocked and concered. ""How do you know its overheating""

EG: I have a Hardware Monitor and its telling me that thread 10 is 60.01C and the rest is 60.00C.

Me: I face palm (if any techs out there know overheating on any cpu is 90C and above. I calmly ask ""ok how are you cooling the CPU""

EG: I am using a custom colling solution do you think that delidding would help

(delidding is when you remove the metal plate on the top of the CPU and replace the TIM (thermal interface material) with either liquid metal or thermal compound)

Me: I would not as it just looks like its just withing the program and the sensors error gradient.

I can no longer remember exactly what the card was but I threw it's name into Google, went to the manufacturer website, and saw in its hardware specs that it supported a maximum of 3 screens.

I explain there are limitations to these things and that whatever she stuck in there is more than likely not compatible with the rest of her system

926,A ferry frustrating ticket,"(This is my first submission and I have no excuse for grammar, typing errors or the other things that seem to make for a preface here)

Many years ago, when band printers and AS400s were a thing, a customer had an intermittent issue where their printer would cease to deliver reams of paper filled with columns of text and figures that no one would read and start to deliver page upon page of random characters that no one could read.

Typically, error would occur, customer calls up, tech dispatched who finds no fault. Tech attempts varied steps involving mechanical tools and dust removal agents of the homing sensors and other diagnostics based on the hyper-informative 7 segment LED display on the main board (that said '0') , checked the connection to the serial comms device was extra snug and then stood around for a suitable length of time ""observing"" the printer operation before leaving with the advice to call again if (when) it happened next time. It would occur for a couple of days then nothing for a week or two. No real discernible pattern.

Now this was in the office of some stock brokers or accountants - some mob who passed for royalty in early '90s Sydney and their office was in a tower with views over Sydney Harbour and in particular Circular Quay. For those of you who have not been blessed with a visit to our beautiful harbour city, Circular Quay is the bit between the Harbour Bridge and the Sydney Opera House where you may have seen the New Years fireworks broadcast from. It also has the International Passenger Terminal where cruise ships dock (they were just P&O Ocean Liners back then). The printer was in a small room with a window that overlooked this view so it was not an unpleasant spot to gaze from while ""observing"" the printer with its snuggly connected serial cable in to the serial comms device while the printer disgorged perfectly aligned columns of text on sheet after sheet of heavily processed tree.

Time passed and, though there had been a report or two in the mean time, a month later I caught this ticket again and returned to spread my tools out to give the impression I could help, check the diagnostics on the hyper-informative 7 segment LED display on the main board (still '0') , polished the capacitors, read a story to the serial comms unit and settled into observe.... when I noticed it was the same ship docked as last time I was there.

To cut this short, (too late you say) , some other techs and I agreed that it was possible the radar of the ship was interfering with the comms to the printer and screwing the data flow and that the radar would only be active on arrival and departure but not while docked. The next time the customer called to report the issue, they confirmed the *P&O Saucy Sailor* was back in port and I suggested they needed to get their comms people to get a better shielded link or comms device in there. I'm assuming that worked as the calls for that issue stopped.",17,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D09BD700>
927,The reluctant learner,"I finally have a story to tell. I've been working in computer repair for almost a year now, but I've been fixing all my families computer issues for almost 20 years. Printer issue? Funlamb, can you fix the printer? Browser issue? Funlamb, can you fix the browser? You get the idea as most of you have been doing this for years as well.

Charectors in our little play:  
$Linda (user, not their real name)  
$Funlamb (Thats me!)  
$Boss (do I really need to explain this one?)

Linda calls our shop and ask for someone to come out and fix her printer/scanner issue she is having. She also wants my opinion on her setup to get a faster connection to the computer upstairs. I can do all those things so I make an appointment. I get to her place and the fun begins.

$Funlamb: Hi, I'm here to fix ~~deine kable~~ your computer issue.

$Linda: Come on in. My scanner isn't sending what I scan directly to e-mail. The guy before you messed it all up.

$Funlamb: We were here before? When was this? 

$Linda: Well no you guys. I had someone else over here and they messed it all up. Now I want you to fix it.  
I already know this is going to be a problem. As you all know there are two types of techs. Ones that know what they are ~~googling~~ doing and ones that don't. My money is on the former and that Linda just didn't like the way things were getting done.

$Funlamb: So what is the issue with the scanner?

$Linda: It doesn't scan directly to my e-mail.

$Funlamab: Ok, let me grab a set and see what's going on. Where is the app you use to work your scanner?

$L: I don't know. 

$F: You don't know what to use to scan from your printer? Let me check the printer. (It's an HP so I find the app from the MacOS Launchpad.) Is this it?

$L: Yes, that's it. I don't know why they moved it. I just haven't been able to scan without it.

$F: I'll just move it onto your dock so that you can find it easily. Now let me try and use it so I know that it works. 

I begin to use the app while she is watching. Mind you I have never used this app before in my life.

$L: Why is it taking so long for you to figure out what you are doing?

$F: This is the first time I've ever used this app. I need to see what it does so I can fix your issue.

$L: Well this is just ridiculous. You should know what you are doing. This is why I hare technology. I just get so impatient with these things.

$F: If you give me a few minutes we can figure this out. (I poke around some more and  
 get the scanner to work.)

$L: Great you got it to scan. Now email it.

$F: Okay, let me try this share button and see if that will e-mail it for you. Nope. It doesn't look like it's going to e-mail from here. Are you sure this was the app you used to scan?

$Narrator: It wasn't...

$L: Well, it's doesn't look the same. Why can't you just figure this out? 

$F: I'll need to find the actual app you use to scan directly to e-mail before we can continue. I think this might be it. Does this look more familiar? 

$L: Yes, lets try that one.

$F: Ok, here we go it looks like it wants you to pick your printer/scanner. Then we will try scanning something. Wait, I can't find the scan button. Hold on.

$L: What do you mean? You just have to scan it. How long have you been fixing computers? Do you know what you are doing?

$F: 10 years (I know if I said 8 months she would have thrown a fit. The reality is I've been fixing all computer for my house hold for 20 years. Sorry not sorry.) It looks like the scan button is hiding under the dock and it's not going to let us click it. Let me change the display settings.

$L: I don't know what that means. 

Here is where I make the mistake of trying to educate her about the display and what is happening. 

$L: Just fix it.

$F: Ok. I'm changing a few things around and there is the scan button. Now we can scan and try to e-mail it. (Scan.....Share.....E-mail) There it is. 

$L: Well, this is just to much work. I used to be able to just hit one button and it would just email it. I'll have to learn how to do it this way I guess. 

$F: This is the only other app I could find that will scan for you. If you could remember what you used before we could work on that but as far as I can see this is it. 

$L: Can you just show me how to do it this way? I'll write everything down so that I can do it when you are not here.

This is where I show her what she needs to do. She writes everything down and practices in front of me and she is getting pretty good at it. I take a look at her wireless setup and see that it is good. We go up to the other computer. I check it's speed and see that it is setup right above the router so she isn't going to need any other expensive equipment to get faster speeds up here since it is literally right above the router that is downstairs. 

$L: Alright, let me know how much I owe you. Thanks for you help.

$F: It was 2 hours of work so that will come out to $$$ ( nothing unreasonable ).

$L: Here you go.

She cuts me a check and I'm on my way back to the office. The rest of the day goes well and I go home thinking I did a good job today.

$Boss: You were right about $Linda. You have to go check the messages. 

$Funlamb: What happened? 

$Phone: You have 1 new message from Linda at 9:30 PM. Hi, this is Linda. Funlamb came to look at my computer and it just seemed like he didn't know what he was doing. My computer is not working the way I want it to and he made everything smaller on my screen. I want someone else to come out and fix my computer at no cost. I will be waiting for you call. 

$Boss: What did you do?

$Funlamb: I fixed her resolution because the app was displaying off the screen so she wasn't able to hit the scan button. 

$Boss: Sounds like she needs to call HP and let them know that the have a UI problem. That will take them about a year to fix. She sounds like she could be a head ache. If you choose not to work with her that is fine by me. 

$Funlamb: Thanks boss.",36,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D09BD760>
928,retired professor with way too much time,"Another story from the early days of my sysadmin career.  This was at a fairly large public university in the US.  There were a couple of retired professors who liked to come by every couple of days so we had an office set aside with an older desktop system for them to use, mostly so they could feel like they were still part of things.   These guys were universally liked since they were always super nice and appreciative of anything we could do for them.  One of these (we'll call him Bob), used to ride his bike in every couple of days, usually he'd stop by my office for a couple of minutes to shoot the breeze.

One day he stopped me in the hallway and asked if we have any computers that still have 5 1/4 inch floppy drives.  That kind of floored me since I was pretty sure we didn't even have any systems with the 3.5 inch floppies.  We were barely using optical media at this time, almost everything was done over the network, or USB stick.  

I told him I didn't think so, but why did he ask?

Turns out he was cleaning out his garage and had found boxes and boxes of old floppies and wanted to go through them to see what was on them.

I'm kind of sensing a huge project I could get sucked into, helping him with his stroll down memory lane.  So, I ask a few questions.

me:  How long have those been in your garage?

Bob:  Oh, ten to fifteen years.

Me:  So, they been through that many summer/winter cycles?  (This was in the Southwest, garage temperature could get up to 120 degrees F in the summer and below freezing in the winter).

Bob: Well, yeah.

Me:  There's a good chance they are mostly unreadable without sending them to a professional data recovery company, which would cost a lot.

Bob:  I don't want to do that, I just want to check myself.  What do you think I should do?

Me:  Do you think there's any thing like social security numbers or stuff like that?

Bob:  No, probably old programs and things like that.

Me:  I'd start throwing one box per week into my trash can until they're all gone.

Bob:  (looking horrified), I can't do that!  There might be Something Important on them!

Me:  Bob, you said these boxes have been your garage for 10-15 years, you've survived this long without them, don't you think maybe maybe they can't be too important?

Bob:  (throws his head back and laughs), I guess you're right.

We had a complaint of all the lights on a phone started coming on and ringer occasionally making noise whenever the CEO left his office. If he was sitting in his chair  it worked just fine. 

Replaced the phone....same problem would happen. Replaced it again....same problem.  proceeded to replace the wiring....same problem.  

Higher level tech was sent out and checked everything....he sat in the chair and problem went away.  Got up and moved...and the problem manifested itself.  He looked out the window at nearby buildings and could see a microwave antenna pointed in their direction.  

He went to that business and found out they had put in a point to point microwave to connect their offices in different buildings that they had line of sight to...except they could just make it by the building between them.  

CEO was in the corner office of that building and the microwave was just clipping his office.  There was enough power to light the lights on the phone so the CEO was getting microwave energy whenever he was in his office. 

He was slowly being cooked on low power.  He was a bit steamed when he found out. (pun intended)",177,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D09BD820>
930,Popcorn!,"This happened back when 802.11b was state of the art.

A buddy and I were giving training on new software to users at multiple locations, we would be at each location for 4-8 weeks.  We had a suite of equipment that consisted of an entire stand-alone network that would be isolated with no external connectivity.  The servers included DCs, Exchange servers and the necessary components to make it work.

The students were using laptops that would connect to the system using 802.11b PCMCIA cards (I told you is was a while ago).  At one site every day at \~0930 the student laptops would loose all connectivity to the network, same time every day, and come back up after a reboot of the WAP.  That damn WAP took about 10 minutes to fully reboot.  We started scheduling a break for 0930 or whenever the network died.

After a couple of weeks of head scratching we discovered an ancient microwave on the other side of the wall from our WAP.  Turns out one of the office workers made popcorn everyday for his morning break and that damn microwave leaked so much RF in the 2.4 band that it would knock our WAP off-line.  Yep, popcorn took us out.

Fix action: Move the WAP across the room and recommend to the local building manager that he get a new microwave as that old was probably a health hazard.

For those interested we were in the US Air Force and we were giving training on the Defense Messaging System (DMS) secure messaging system to secretaries and other office workers.  Some of those secretaries were barely able to use Outlook and we had to try to train them to use DMS, FUN TIMES.",25,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D09BD880>
931,"Coding with no specification, the management said ""you don't need a specification you are being paid to use your brain as well as to code""","So as a senior software developer (with some 12 years of experience at that point) I was hired to lead a minor group of juniors for a small-ish company (30-40 employees).

First hint that there might be problems ahead dealing with the management of this particular company was the info I got that the entire previous dev team had rage quit and additionally were being sued by the company.

My first task was to reverse engineer VBA scripts embedded in an excel document (made by a competing company), the idea was to import into our database everything ""as - is"" (in string format mostly), the business rules (validations) were implemented within the said excel template and not in our application. Our application was to simply import user data straight into our data store (no validation, no transformation), and then to export it into a new excel - this new excel would then be distributed to the clients who would then make adjustments to the data (that at this point would pass thru validations implemented within the excel document). As you can see, the idea, in its entirety was TERRIBLE.

The real ""winner"" came shortly thereafter as the sole junior who had been working on an app called ""APP X"" (for the purposes of this article) suddenly quit. The reason he quit was - he knew what the TRUE state of application had been at that point and therefore was 100% certain he could not deliver what was needed to avoid being sued by the client. The guy was a student at the time he was hired by the company to create a C# application, the problem was - he was studying java. The management of this company was COMPLETELY oblivious to such nuances.

Before he left he was tasked to leave behind at least some documentation, which he did - but since he was unsupervised (the company could not spare anyone at that time to take a look at the documentation and see if its ""ok"") so he simply took the screenshots of all the user forms and named them ""UI 1"", ""UI 2"" etc. The documentation was, therefore, completely useless.

At this point I was given first actual tasks on the ""APP X"" - the task was to basically change how the entire application worked in like a 4 weeks time (whilst simultaneously working on other projects). The application was a bit hard to navigate through - it seemed I could not find any repository classes (those are usually used to connect to the data store) but I said to myself ""hey, the guy was a junior he probably hid all his SQL statements somewhere, so no problem, I will find where the SQL was sooner or later"". 

The data was present on the frontend, the list of users, the list of projects, so stuff seemed to function normally.

I was told the application had been  in full production for approximately a year, so I was not (yet) alarmed by not being able to immediately find the SQL. 

Soon thereafter I needed to rework how the list of projects were displayed to admin users, I could SEE the LIST OF PROJECTS but the database was empty, no tables, no projects, no nothing...then it dawned on me...so I did a full ""FIND ALL"" on the entire project and used one of the project names as search criteria - and BINGO! the entire list was there - in HTML, hardcoded.

Obviously the entire app was not, at that moment, ""connected"" to a data store, and this is how it had been working in production for at least a year. All exceptions were being overridden to return a ""SUCCESS"" message, so all testers (on both sides) were completely fooled by this. All of the deletes and updates seemed to be working. JQuery had made sure inserts looked semi-ok as well. 

Ok, so now I was aware of the full extent of the problem at hand, I basically needed to ""connect the app to the data store"" (featuring some 200-ish UI forms), the management said ""how hard can that be for a senior developer, its a simple task"", and under normal circumstances that would be true, you simply take the specification, model the database as per normalization rules, create repository layer (ORM) and design the needed queries. 

The problem was - the entire thing had to be completed in like 3 weeks.

Ok, fine, I said ""give me the specification so I can get started"", the sooner I get started the sooner we will know how quickly the task can be accomplished on 1 (one) senior developer.

So they said:

""We don't have the specification, our former employee had it (in his outlook inbox), and he left, there's no specification, but a senior developer should not need to be told everything, we expect you to THINK as well as to act, all within the previously agreed time constraints."" - the usual managerial mumbo jumbo when they have no clue whatsoever what they are doing but are being pressed by impending doom.

So I asked, ""ok, well, cant the PM visit the client and ask what needs to be done?""

""No, the client must not find out that the application has not been finished, it is in \*production\* after all, if we were to begin asking such question at this point we would end up being sued""

So I said ""Ok, so ...  let us sum this up real quick; the application is a complete fake, its not ""connected"" to an actual data store, the specification is irrevocably gone, and the client thinks that the application is 99% complete and is willing to sue if we don't deliver in 2 weeks?""

""Yes, but that should not be a problem for a senior developer, right? we ARE paying you after all?""

(actually, several payment were being late at that moment in time)

Right, I immediately begun looking for a new job, and the following 2 weeks had passed with no real work being done, so the pressure mounted; I started receiving late night mails along the lines of ""Will we have a working sample delivered to test tomorrow morning?"" so I replied ""No. With kind regards, XY""

At the same time the company brought in a new ""managing director"" to fix things, to discipline people and to make things work - at that point it was really quite obvious the company was gonna burn down, Hollywood style. 

The PM begun arriving at work at 14:00, proceeding directly to nearby café (to continue his drinking), he needed to be properly boozed up before even talking to me, because he didn't have a feeling that I was taking this whole thing seriously enough and that I would cause the company to burn, but at the same time was unable to exert pressure to make me work 120 hrs / week (the overtime was unpaid).

Right about that point in time, the time for me to go on vacation came - lest the vacation days be lost (the laws in my country state that if you don't ""consume"" your paid vacation time by a certain date, the vacation is permanently lost) - so I chose to go on vacation instead of working for the company.

That was the final straw. One week into my paid vacation I got summoned to the office, and got fired for destroying the companies good name and an excellent project that had been successful in production up to that point. 

After all, the client had signed the handover, the testers on both sides signed the acceptance documents. 

A colleague from the ""other"" department (sysops) jumped from his balcony. 

Another colleague threw an ashtray at a waiter at the local bar. 

Entire sales and marketing team left.

Software development department got closed.

The companies assets got ""frozen"".

932,Similar tales from two different moments in time and in one story.,"A similar ISP horror story reminded me of the joys of making big changes to Internet and phone connectivity. Strap in folks, it's a long one spanning over a decade.

ME = Me 

Big-C = Large ISP  

Big-V = Large ISP 

Many moons ago I was already IT for a new car dealership and both the owners and myself noticed that the manufacturer was steadily moving towards a larger Internet presence and moving away from their own Intranet. Working with a continuing troublesome T1 connection for Internet I was happy to make the call to Big-C to start the upgrade process. The building itself was older and in an established retail/industrial area of the city. I was also very aware that there was no physical coax cable into this building much less at the street. I informed Big-C that I needed a site survey done to see what we are looking at to have their connectivity at this location. I used the words ""site survey"" and mentioned multiple times that ""There is no physical cable here"". Day and time scheduled and I updated my calendar accordingly.

The day arrives and I'm on my way there and my phone rings. John Smith with Big-C  ""I'm here, what location inside the building am I going?"" Me - ""Phone room in the middle of the building and I'll be there I just a few minutes"" Cool, now we're getting somewhere. Moments later I'm turning into the parking lot and John from Big-C is pulling out in his van. I stop him and ask what's up? He said and I quote ""There's no coax to this building I can tie into."" FFS ""Do me a favor and park I need 5 minutes of your time"" at which point I go into my diatribe of ""site survey"" and multiple mentions of ""No physical cable"" etc. etc.  Multiple phones calls and visits from Big-C Construction and Sales over details and a final number was laid out. Just under a 1000' of coax trunk to the address, coax install and multiple phone lines (Important later) and a number was agreed upon by both parties. And for those asking I did make sure that Big-C was aware of the multiple ""other"" businesses along their new trunk.

Fast forward more than a decade and the connectivity at the location has gone through phone ports, upgrades and the standard issues but enough to have a decent relationship with Big-C. Enter a new General Manger with a bit more spending power than he should have and thus begins the process of building upgrades including a new VOIP system. Being an older building, network upgrades were necessary to accommodate a new network of phones along side of the current network (Hooray me!). Included in this were fiber lines for voice and a point to point for their remote site. Big-C was actually fairly easy to deal with in this aspect and the move from coax to fiber went well. Minor issues were fixed and porting was completed successfully. On an important side note Internet connectivity was still on Coax since Big-C told me flat out that we would lose our 5 IPV4 statics if we moved it over to fiber. That was a big ""nope"". 

A year or so later enter Big-V. Now Big-V was pretty much out of the picture once active numbers were ported and their old T1 Point to Point was moved to Big-C's fiber. They were still billing for two POTS numbers though. Office wasn't sure what they were for but had received a notice from Big-V that they were upgrading their Central Office to all fiber. That meant that these numbers would need to move over to their Fios platform. I can understand this since the copper in this area was easily over 60 years old and becoming troublesome to deal with. A phone call to Big-V to get more details and schedule a time. This conversation includes ""Big-V has no fiber to this building"" and a ""site survey"" needs to happen. In the back of my mind I was thinking that Fios lines into the building would be nice for redundancy. Shame on me.

The following day and more than a week before scheduled time for the ""site survey"" a dealership manager contacts me and says there's a fire alarm error with a very loud beeping from the console. Yep, found our mystery POTS lines. Contact Big-V on why the lines were disconnected long before the Fios service was even surveyed much less turned on. A bunch of ""this"" and a lot of ""that"" pretty much confirmed that the left hand didn't know what the right hand was doing. After explaining that these lines were for the building fire alarm system they at least reactivated the lines. This should be fun. The scheduled day arrives and I'm there long before John Johnson from Big-V arrives with a box in his hand. I don't even take him to the phone room and he confirms that he's here to move the POTS lines over to their Fios box. Oh, it gets better folks.

I tell John that there are no Fios fiber lines on the premises. His head sinks. John makes some phone calls to what I assume is the right or left hand and soon a big wheel from Big-V construction team shows up. He confirms that there is no fiber on premises belonging to Big-V and that a site survey needs to happen. He's shown where the current copper and Big-C's fiber enter into the building with emphasis that this is the requirement that Big-V has put forth and that it's covering current POTS for the fire alarm. Okay with a thumbs up. Several days later Miss Utility has come out and marked the location for power, water, gas and Big-C's fiber coming in. Things are looking up but I still have this nagging feeling.

Out of curiosity I contact Big-V and confirm that there is a construction ticket in the system and I confirm that the utilities have been marked. I let sleeping dogs lie. On the 30 day anniversary of the first disconnect the alarms on the fire console are going off again. I check and no dial tone. I waste a lot of time on the phone with Big-V with anyone that'll listen and they all say the same thing. All tickets have a note that on the account that ""client has refused upgrade"". I ask who contacted Big-V to cancel? There's no information on ""who contacted who"" to cancel the upgrade. So I ask the following "" Okay so you require a PIN number, address conformation and have a strict point of contact (Myself and owner) to make any type of account modification and you have nothing to show? Supervisor...now!"" After an hour of back and forth along with details of how left hand and right hand communicate I get a promise of a phone call the next morning. It's well past 8 PM at this point and my head hurts.

As I'm going over and over this madness in my head I come to the realization that Big-V is ghosting me and I now need to figure out a way to resolve this mess. Maybe I can temporarily use current fax lines for a dial tone. In the very least until I can get at least two separated lines in from Big-C (A requirement from city fire dept and the alarm company.). At this point I was done with Big-V and needed them out. My eureka moment hits me in the middle of the night. The next morning, tools in hand I enter the phone room and find the older, still active Big-C Phone Modem still connected to coax. Low and behold two active dial tones with nothing connected.  Turns out when we first ported phones over to Big-C these were needed since fax machines were still having problems with digital lines and analogs were recommended. They were never used since it turns out the newer MFP's in place didn't have an issue with digital. So after some reconfiguration of the old lines and a call to the monitoring service on the number changes all was quiet. Labels and a big sign were placed on the phone modem that read ""Don't Touch! Fire Alarm Connections!"". Big-C got us out of the bind and didn't even know it. And what a surprise I never got that phone call from Big-V.

The dealership was sold after a while and as far as I know the setup is still the same. For years a statement I've told pretty much all my clients: "" The biggest communications issues I run into are with communications companies.""",26,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D09BD940>
933,A train isn't good for coax.,"Worked for an ISP/cable company years ago and this one stands out.

We had a ticket for an install to a house in a rural area.  This house had a train track that ran behind the home and the box on the pole was on the opposite side of the track as the home.  It was a newer area that we serviced and therefore it required a drop to the house from the pole.

Tech was sent out for the install and realized the problem, proceeds to call it in.  Tech wasn't certified to hang a line on the pole.  Supervisor instructed to continue with the install.  He did.

5:00 CSX comes by and runs over the coax that was laid across the tracks.

Of course the tech was sent back out again and was instructed to replace the drop.  He did.

5:00 CSX comes through and slices it again.

After a few more of these work orders it was put in to ELEVATE the drop!!  He did.

About 6 foot off the ground.

5:00 CSX comes through and grabs the coax, proceeds to rip the wiring out of the house, exploding the cable modem on the wall, knocking the PC off the desk and TV's off stands, damages to the bricks on the house, other.

Cable company had to pay for repairs to the bricks in the house and all damaged equipment.  Customer had full package free or as long as they lived there, all channels, fastest internet, etc.

I kept up with the documentation on the account while this was going on and I am glad I did.  This was before smart phones so I couldn't get the proof, didn't carry a cell phone at all back then.

934,Old Pentium in the basement,"Long time lurker on TFTS, thought I’d share a story from a few years back. English is not my first language.


A couple of years back I worked at a large Software company which develops Payroll/HRM Software, but also did Payroll administration for other companies which didn’t have them in-house. The company at the time had around ~2500 employees.

My job was 1st line support for internal employees. Every phone call, e-mail pretty much went through me and I had to dispatch. Often I also had to do second line tickets as well because we were pretty understaffed.

The team consisted out of multiple employees, my direct colleague which dealt with second line calls. One colleague which only dealt with the phone system. And two elder men which were put in the basement dealing with hardware replacements. We also had one Teamlead.

We only dealt with internal employees and had nothing to do with customers or supported any of the software the company developed. I often did receive calls when software x or y stopped functioning, but always had to point them elsewhere.

I was working there about 8 months in when one of the elder men retired. This was around summer time when things got quiet at the office. My teamlead decided it would be sad to leave the other guy in the basement, and also would be better for us to have him come sit at the office.

My Teamlead confiscated one of the manager office (with the fancy glass walls) next to us for him to come sit there. So we went ahead and started to clean the basement and moved hardware upstairs, every piece of ancient hardware would be given to charity (there was A LOT!). We put everything in carts for charity to pick up.

The basement desk consisted of two workspaces, but there were three desktops, one of the desktops was an old Pentium III only had power and ethernet connected to it. My teamlead and I cleaned up the desktops and put the Pentium III inside of the cart.

Three weeks went by and most of my colleague’s went on holiday. I received a call from the software development team there was a problem with a payroll conversion for a large customer. Like I mentioned earlier, we do not deal with inhouse software/customers. 

The next day I had a manager at my desk explaining that a company delivers them files which they upload into a webserver which converts the files so it becomes compatible with the inhouse software, which can then get the Payroll going. I explained to him that I had no idea what he was talking about and should be going to the Sysadmins to check on the webserver.

Later that day I both had the manager and one of the Sysadmins sitting at my desk explaining they couldn’t reach http://10.10.30.21/ anymore. At this point I’m getting really annoyed, explaining this isn’t my problem nor do I manage the infrastructure. I already am busy as it is being the only support employee. They both explained a large Bank employee’s didn’t receive their salary and that this is a huge problem.

Things went back and forth for a couple of days, and during those conversations I started to get more and more information about the webserver being down. It turns out the employee who made the webserver left the company years ago. Also there was no documentation. 

Went outside for a smoke and started thinking about the whole situation where I suddenly thought to myself, can it be one of the old desktops? Surely it can’t be the old Pentium III machine right? I went to the basement and went through the disposal cart. Took the machine up, connected it to a monitor. It started booting Linux (forgot which one). Once booted up I tried connecting to the webserver, but still received a timeout.

I walked to one of the Sysadmin’s to check the latest DHCP leases and try reaching the webserver on each IP, first try.. the webserver. I asked the software department if this was the webserver they were referring to, which got confirmed.

I also explained that this was a Pentium III machine that apparently has been sitting in the basement for years, which didn’t matter to anyone, of course not, their webserver was working again wasn’t it? I told them to deal with the issue and pull the information off the machine so we can get rid of it as it is now running under my desk… Also no one had the credentials for the Linux machine.

Weeks went by and the machine was still collecting dust under my desk. I started threatening the department that I will unplug the machine soon if they didn’t do anything about it. I asked if they couldn’t call the employee that left the company if he still had the credentials, this is where the story gets a little sad though. It turns out that not only he left the company, but also had a stroke in his backyard which left him laying on the ground for two days and has been in a coma ever since.

I suddenly felt really bad about the whole situation and the way I have been reacting. I offered the software department to see if we could hire a Consultant to convert the machine to a virtual machine at their costs which was agreed upon. After finding one, it took the Consultant three days to convert the machine which I passed on to the Sysadmins to run on ESX.

No one expected that this conversion webserver for salary payment of large Bank was running in the basement all these years. The ones that did know left the company either years ago, or retired.

Until this day I still think that machine is running.

A year later I left the company, but that is a different story.



Edit: 07/08/2021 - Thanks guys, very positive reactions so far. I also got a long story why I quit that company involving a screaming #Karen. This story might inspire people stuck in a similar situation like as I was, but want to move up.",64,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D09BDA00>

Well, I knew that the installation engineer on Friday had checked everything and had convinced himself that they just needed a little time to charge up before initial use, still best to check...

Bright yellow labels on the back covering the battery access stated that the battery MUST be connected for the UPS module to work. OK, tear off the labels, connect the batteries everything works properly.

936,Caught a helpdesk scammer,"So a couple weeks ago a user requests a docking station for use at home. I know for a fact she has a docking station at her desk, but she wants one just to set up at home because ""there are too many wires"".

Well, lead time on docking stations is currently something like 6 weeks, we're supposed to be either full time WAH or in-office, not going between, and no one, but no one who isn't in the C suites gets two docks. Her request is denied.

A few days ago, same user claiming their docking station is broken. I go deskside and ethernet, 2 monitors, keyboard and mouse are working. I unplug it, plug it back in, everything comes up like fine clockwork. Ticket closed with ""issue self corrected"" and a private note that there weren't nothing wrong to begin with.

Today, another ticket from the same user. docking station intermittently failing. This one calls me out specifically for not fixing it last time. Nope, not how things happen in my helpdesk.

Tell her again I can't find any faults, but she is insistent that it stops working sometimes. Okay, says I, I have an older model dock. Does everything the current one does but doesn't have charging over the USB-C port so she'll need to lug 2 power bricks between here and home.

She's okay with that, so I swap the docks and pick up the old one. I don't think she quite caught on that I used most of the old cables and she'd have had to know what a DisplayPort cable is even if her plan worked.

""Where are you taking that?"" She asks, sounding angry.

""Oh, we've got to dispose of bad hardware. Though in this case I thought I'd use it for building laptops. Even if it's not 100% it works well enough to use on the workbench.""

""But it's mine,"" she whines, ""I have to throw it out.""

And the plan is revealed. Not like it wasn't obvious but seriously, what was she thinking?

""Oh, sorry, no. E-Waste has to go through removal from active stock, then proper disposal. Go green, save the planet. Besides, I think we can still use this.""

You could see it hit her, she saw her glorious future of not having to disconnect wires vanish in a puff of bureaucratic smoke.

And that's how I got a current model docking station for my work laptop, with USB-C PD and triple monitors at my desk.

*$CX: ""Yes, when will it be done?""*

*$ME: ""If we're not doing the data backup I can have it done and ready tomorrow, it just needs to search for updates, and I'll have it do that over night. I'll call you when it's ready.""*

The next day he picks it up, seems like no problem. About an hour later I get a phome call from him. He's pissed.

*$CX: ""Where's my [Accounting Program]?""*

*$ME: ""It's gone, any programs on there will need to be reinstalled""*

*CX: ""No, my last 5 years of taxes were on that and I need to get that to my accountant next week! I need that""*

*$ME: ""I'm sorry Sir, I asked if you wanted your data backed up, and you said you didn't, so I didn't do that.""*

*$ME: ""If that's the case, in the future you'd want [virus removal service] but I can see about recovering the data if you bring it back in.""*

The customer brought back in the PC, and I spent the next day and a half waiting for the data recovery to finish. He claimed that he needed 4 years of his accounting data, but even though I was recover all other data no problem, I could only find one years worth of the data in question.

**Me:** Can I renegotiate this rate please? We are porting out our phone number to our regular VOIP provider.

**ISP:** Sure thing! Here's 100/100 Static IP Business plan for $60. We'll keep your phone service on the account until the port is completed.

**ISP:** Yep! This won't affect your internet! We'll send a tech out to set it up.

The tech comes out the next day to tell me my static IP block and heads out. After not seeing a speed boost, I check the config on the router and notice they had 5ghz turned off, and everything is on a fully congested 2.4ghz channel. I fix that and everything gets a nice speed boost.

Two days ago I noticed the port finished, I call the ISP back again to verify the port completed and to verify the phone service is disconnected. They say it's all good.

I called again yesterday to verify our new billing amount, and to verify that our internet service will be unaffected. ""It all looks good here!""

I get to work early today and notice that there's no Internet. I've got link lights but I can't ping the ONT. I call the ISP to see what's going on, they can't find my account, then they hang up on me. 20 minutes wasted.

I call back again, they find my old account and try to see what's happening, but then hang up again. 30 minutes wasted. Meanwhile, everyone else is returning to work and can't do shit without internet. The owner is breathing down my neck wondering what's happening.

I call back again and get a competent worker this time, they find my account. Turns out they closed my account because they assumed we didn't want it anymore after we ported our number out. This is despite being told multiple times that everything is ok, and I made it explicitly clear we still needed internet.

She opens us a new account account and says a tech will come out to activate it within about 24 hours. This is not negotiable. So no internet for basically the rest of the week.

After explaining the situation to the owner we start setting up workers with wifi hotspots on their phone, but start running into problems. Turns out EVERY single computer on the network has a static IP set, despite DHCP being setup and working on the router. I start turning DHCP back on for every client one by one.

We now have a semi-workable environment for the day, the owner still insists that he doesn't need WAN fail over, a backup ISP, or a managed wired network with monitoring.

Now I'm spending the rest of the day teaching employees how to access resources, cancelling all my meetings with the vendors, and disabling IP based conditional access policies. And to top it all off my Amazon packages are arriving late.

939,"sales person over commits, no surprise there","Long ago in my first sysadmin job, early 2000s, our infrastructure included a rather fancy file server.  We had got it through a donation since it was too expensive for us to have sourced ourselves.  It took up a half a rack, multiple shelves of disks plus a controller unit.  It had a capacity of 100Gb raw, which we thought was really cool at the time, but we finally filled it up and started dickering with the vendor on an upgrade.   The company gave us a pretty good deal on a new unit, but wanted us to trade in the old one, clearly they didn't want the parts turning up on the second hand market.    No problem, just make sure its in your quote. 

After we had the quote and I was working with our Purchasing folks to get a PO, someone pointed out that this device used proprietary utilities for stuff like data migration, was I sure we could the data off the old unit?  I had not considered this and luckily I ran into the the sales guy shortly after.  I mentioned this concern and he hand waved the issue, no problem at all, they'd do it for free.  I was surprised and asked if he could email me an updated quote that stated this, no problem (more hand waving), and he did.

We got the new system, got it installed and configured, and scheduled an overnight outage to migrate the data.  It then turned out that our existing unit was so old it did not support the newer migration tools.  We were on the phone for hours with various support types, none of them had experience with our old unit.   We scrubbed the migration and put old machine back in production.

Needless to say the next day was a huge mess of phone calls and emails while the vendor tried to figure out if any of their tools spanned the generations.   I was worried we were going to have to do a backup/restore using NFS, which would have taken forever.   Finally the lead sales guy notified us that a certain tool would work, and we rescheduled the migration.  

To perform the migration both devices had to be in single-user/maintenance mode, and we could not ssh in, access was only possible by a serial console set up, so we connected an old VT100 terminal, and kicked off the copy.   And we got nothing on the console to indicate anything was happening.  We let it run for a while and noticed that the we could tell the disks on both machines were doing something, based on watching the LEDs.  We finally halted the the process, tried to figure out if it had done anything, then restarted it.  We noted that when we halted the process, it did display some output that indicated some amount of data had been copied.  We finally decided we had to just let it run.  The senior sales guy was with us and spent a lot of time on the phone with their support trying to find out if there was anyway to monitor progress.  Nope, you had to stop it and restart it, it \*should\* be picking up where it left off, but no one was sure.  

At this point I'm talking to my boss, figuring my job is probably on the line.  He was pretty good, worst case we give them this new unit back since we had not paid for it yet (after all, data migration was part of the deal).  But we just let it run.  Almost 3 days, which we had calculated based on the numbers we saw when we stopped and restarted the migration.

It eventually finished, we powered down the original server and reconfigured the new one with the same hostname and IP as the old one, and brought it up.   And everything worked, and we now had space to spare.

The sales guys were all pretty sheepish but the main thing they wanted was for us to load the old unit into the trunk of their car so they could ensure it never saw the light of day.

I went through several other upgrade/migrations in the following years, and we never had an issue like this again.   Of course we never let the old and new units get so far apart in age either!",11,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D09BDBE0>

941,A Tale as old as Tech,"just happened but its a classic scenario and follows all the tropes.

An “executive” complains to his Assistant about internet. Assistant doesn’t file a report but instead had a outburst on the phone with a random / unrelated tech support person on the companies general support hotline (Exec would need VIP support in-person since we have teams dedicated for that) this poor soul gets yelled at with 0 details and gets hung up on. she tries to gather what she can and report it to her super visor who seeks out another super visor who seeks me out. (its confusing because there are multiple offices in different states and the execs fly around alot)

Me: “okay where do you need me to be” 
Supervisor: “he’s on the 9th floor” 
Me: “No body here” 
 *I am added to a group chat*  
 someone else : “ 4th floor “ 
 Me: “no one here” 
*starting to realize no one knows where he is, and what his specific issue is because this is all reactionary from the manager. ordering their legions of staff to throw their bodies onto a problem with no idea whats going on or what their roles are for that matter (severely understaffed and mismanaged) *

after a bunch of back and forth she procures me the Execs number I just casually call his cell. 
Me: “Hi, which floor are you on , you need help with wifi?”
 executive: “oh im actually (in a different state) today and i resolved it myself” *and didnt tell anyone*

her Manager: grumbles* and tells the tele-tech she needs to get her details straight.  

Im a contractor so i kinda dont care about some of the hierarchies at the company. I thanked her for being able to gather all the information from a angry phone call about an issue unrelated to her duties.
Managers are treated like children and yelled at so they just react to every situation by drumming up chaos ; not standing their ground regarding THEIR own protocols. 

sigh* 
i known it’s not a very spicy or dramatic one but its just frustrating that this kind of thing is rampant. maybe yall can relate.

EDIT: Formatting

TLDR: Vague Executive goes to Angry Assistant goes to Wrong IT person goes to Clueless Manager goes to a Reactionary Manager goes to Frustrated IT person (Me) who finds out that the issue was resolved itself and we just ran around for nothing.",19,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D09BDCA0>
942,Because its not a computer,"I used to do tech support for my family.

I stopped because it was too hard (emotionally). My mother is incredibly stubborn and creative in the new way she finds to do things on computers that result in them not working. A close family friend who is a IT professional had taken over, which worked well until he moved to the other side of town.

A few months back I had a spare usb docking station, monitor, mouse and keyboard, so I gave it to my family to make it easier for my mother to use her laptop.

She asked me to set things up, however there was a covid lockdown and I had a phone conversation where I said something to the effect of 'there isnt anything to set up, you just plug it all in and use it. try that first and i'll trouble shoot if it doesn't work'. 

Nothing happened

Covid lockdown finished and when I'd visit the docking station remained unused.

And at some point I just set the thing up.

<time passes>

A few weeks ago I said, how about I show you how to use the docking station. I got her laptop, plugged it into the docking station and everything worked. Mum was fine and happy and browsing away. I left.

20 min later I get home and get a call.

M: Hey what password do i use to log in?

T: The same one you always use

M: No I want log into the new device

T: Use your laptop password to log in

M: No I want my laptop off and i want to use the docking station to browse and connect to the internet

T: That's not possible, you have to use your laptop to do that. You are using your laptop, just use your laptop password

M: I dont want to use my laptop. I've turned it off. i just want to use the thing you set up to use the laptop. Whats the pass word for it.

T: Huh, sorry, I dont follow you want to do what?

<I also have no idea how there was anything to log into if she had turned off the laptop>

M: I want to browse the internet with the thing you set up.

<at this point I had an epiphany>

T: Mum, that thing is not a computer. There is only 1 computer there. Your laptop. without your laptop there is nothing to connect the internet to. That thing just makes it easier to connect other things to your laptop

M: But I want to use the internet on the thing

T: You can't, it's not a computer

M: But I thought it could connect to the internet

T: It's not a computer. It can't

943,"""I DID'NT SPEND SEVEN YEARS IN MEDICAL SCHOOL TO FIX YOUR #%*^!!!!!!""","Working for a manufacturer of things that were NOT medical related, I got a voicemail from an MD screaming about some piece of hardware.

""YOUR STOOPID <device> DOES'NT WORK AND YOUR VOICEMAIL BOX IS NOT CONFIGURED.""

(This was on my personal voicemail, which is configured.)

No phone number, no name, no idea where the call originated from, the only thing I was certain of is that we were NOT in the business of making medical instruments of any kind.

A few similar messages landed in my vMail in the ensuing week, until I FINALLY managed to live-answer one of these calls. After calming the caller down, I pieced together what was going on.

The medical device in question was a bit of office automation, nothing patient-facing thank god. The caller described having trouble with this device and calling the phone number on the leaflet that came in the shipping carton with said device. That phone number was mis-printed, and thousands of these devices were shipped with a bogus tech support number.

The number printed on the paper was one of my 500 DIDs, coincidentally unused, with no TN and no voicemail box. Those few callers that managed to leave me messages simply pounded '0' until my employers' admin assistants (there were three sharing call answering duties) answered. They apparently didn't question why IT support requests were coming in on an outside line, they merely forwarded the call to my number.

Until the day I ripped that PBX off the wall, that DN still had an outgoing message in my malodorous dulcet tone: ""You've reached <not the company you think you called.> Please note that we DO NOT make the device for which you are attempting to get support, THAT company misprinted their documentation and gave you the wrong number. For support on your <device> please call <medical devices company on the other side of town> at xxx-xxx-xxxx.

&#x200B;

THAT was a fun call with their IT department. I decided I should speak tech-to-tech, rather than try to explain it all to their marketing or quality staff. A few TalesFromTechSupport quality anecdotes were shared while we brainstormed the solution on my end and while she started rattling cages in her own shop.

944,"Where are the project requirements? ""What do you mean? That's what we're paying YOU for!""","Over the last year or so I've had the, uhhhh, pleasure of watching roughly 2/3 of our little consultant company's work force quit and run for the hills, mostly due to the mismanagement of a pair of absolute train-wreck projects.


One to ""upgrade"" a completely functional but no-longer-supported-by-the-vendor Angular tool/site.... by completely rebuilding it all as a dedicated .Net thing. We're not going to dwell on all the silliness involved in this, though I will mention that when I first pitched in they handed me a 1200 line STATIC HTML page that was very obviously created by copy-pasting the angular output and having an Intern manually go through it and set up the mappings... I don't really know how they wound up at that point, only there was a LOT of uninformed promises and ""estimates"" in early phases and the constant rotation of people working on, realizing it's insane, and then quitting. Eventually, at the cost of the company's most-senior developer/architect, that nose-dive leveled off to the point where (only 8 months behind schedule) the customer now has an app just as good as the one they started with, and we can now start working on improvements.


The other project didn't go nearly so well. 


To start with some important groundwork: our little company's CEO is comically out of touch. He used to code at some point, at least that's what he says, and believes this makes him an adequate subject matter expert as far as estimates and approaches go, and that he's ""one of us"" (seriously, he keeps dragging the one on-site Junior Dev out to random lunches to ""shoot the shit"" and has invited us all to his virtual birthday party next month with instructions to ""bring an amusing or embarrassing anecdote about working with me"". Imagine that energetic, but unqualified guy that got added to your team, so you do your best to push him towards the pointless busywork tasks and have someone more senior doublecheck literally everything he does in case he accidentally sets the office on fire... except he's the CEO and perfectly willing to override/fire anyone who second guesses his genius. He does not grasp why he ""doesn't get more honest feedback"", though I'm working on that.


My role in this is just being a senior-ish dev on an absolutely bullet-proof contract, who's been feeling bad about the two remaining junior devs and have been doing some OT (paid, you better fuckin believe me) to help triage the train-wrecks and get things moderately back on track. However, since I'm cheerfully cynical about the whole thing and perfectly willing to call the CEO's bullshit (what's he going to do, fire me and let the customer direct-hire me without breaching their contract?), I've somehow been designated as both his ""Friend"" and ""Only Expert Worth Listening To"". I mostly just act as an interpreter between him and the Junior devs, since there's a direct correlation between people quitting and how much they have to interact with crazy CEO man.


Now, on to the second train-wreck project. When I first got brought in to survey the wreckage and give my input on what needs to be done to get things back on track, I was told we were writing a fair-sized piece of middleware to transform incoming web requests and then shove them into various databases, replacing a bunch of SQL stored procedures that nobody at the customer's company is qualified to maintain. That all sounded decent enough, until I asked to see the Requirements and Tech Design Docs... which didn't exist. That's not to say there was nothing, we had piles of documentation on the assorted use-cases for the middleware, mostly made by the single junior dev who did 90% of the actual code work, who extracted the data from the customer's team via an absolutely grueling series of meetings. We also had piles and piles of other documentation from the 3-ish prior attempts to inject some amount of sanity and order into the process, which were all put on hold by the CEO, since ""the team needs to be writing code to show the customer we're working hard"". Needless to say, those people quitting was a complete surprise to him.


So, in short, we've got a project with little-to-no documentation, but on the bright side, that one junior dev had been soldiering through like a champ, working with the ground-level folks at the customer to generate requirements and design on the fly so he could keep writing code, and GOOD code at that. Honestly, it looked to me like all we really had to do was shake some concrete OFFICIAL requirements out of the customer and draw up a decent design docs, and then just let the junior dev keep working without the CEO or Customer jogging his elbow all the time. I relay this information to the CEO, and volunteer to be the customer-shaker for this so I can make sure we actually get what we need... and then get told not to worry about it, he'll handle it personally in his meeting with the customer's Chief of Ops coming up that week.


Well, after several days of working on getting internal documentation straightened out with the team (Junior Dev and a newly-hired mid-level guy, who the CEO fired for ""not being a team player"" within the month), I finally get the word back from the CEO about how the meeting with the customer went, and the word is ""Stop"". No more coding, none at all, just sit there and document stuff. I was honestly elated, since this was what I'd been telling him was needed since the start, but then I found out the reason why: The customer didn't want our code, not because it was bad, but because HE'D NEVER ASKED FOR IT IN THE FIRST PLACE. The contract was apparently to analyze their internal system and generate a requirements doc FOR the customer, preferably without wasting any of his people's time asking silly questions like, well, what their damn requirements are. This is where it finally clicked for me and I realized that it was the leadership on BOTH sides that was crazy, not just ours.


See, anyone who's been around the block a few times as a dev can tell you that Requirements are a huge, absolutely crucial, and easily fuck-up-able part of any project, and the surest way to torpedo the whole project is to have the Requirements written by people who aren't the actual users. While it's possible to hire a consulting company to HELP you make a good requirements document, telling them just to do it for you is a catastrophically stupid idea, virtually guaranteed to end with the Customer holding a completely useless pile of garbage and lawsuits about how much they'd paid for it. The customer's COO didn't agree though, he didn't want his people wasting their time on planning their own system's upgrade, those are hours they could be doing REAL work!

This COO guy had gone through negotiations at least five different larger contracting firms, who all dug in their heels on the requirements issue and refused to take on the project. So, rather than take the fucking hint, the COO decides to hire a separate firm just to make the Requirements documents, so he could then take them to the larger companies he'd already been negotiating with. Of course he didn't have much better luck, since now he was just explicitly asking for the stupid part up front, but then enter our CEO... who happily agreed that it sounded totally reasonable and he'd get a team on it right away.

The first two senior people our CEO tried to put on the contract flatly refused, but one of our Project Managers was incapable of telling him ""no"", so the project started with the PM and a few devs, who quickly realized what a shit-show this all was and all took turns quitting, until (after four complete team changes) it was just the Junior Dev doing the work and the CEO acting as the Project Manager. Despite all this turnover and our CEO's magical ability to reshape his perception of reality to fit his internal narrative, this shouldn't have been enough to forget what the whole point of the contract was, but he maintains that the initial customer contract was for a whole Rebuild, not just generating the requirements for it out of thin air. Fortunately our CEO had a moment of lucidity and dropped the contract rather than press further.

The final cherry on top of this that led to so much wasted code, was that the customer's leadership was just as bad at communication as ours, AND HIS ENTIRE TEAM THOUGHT WE WERE THERE FOR A REBUILD TOO, hence all the time they were willing to spend talking with Junior Dev and testing his work. We had to tell THEM what was going on, and at the final meeting where we handed over the jumbled pile of documentation we'd accumulated and the 85% complete piece of middleware, you could just hear the frustration and resignation in their voices as they talked about how close they got to replacing all the SQL spaghetti they'd been dealing with for the last 10 years.

946,Wetware Blockchain for screamtesting a printer,"Two weeks ago, we had an external technician (ET) in our office to start to redo all of our patch panels.

Last friday, we got the last missing printer from the printer swap started last year. It didn't want to work. 

Yesterday, I hears my teamleads boss (TB) talking to another colleague just outside my office, asking him, if there is any way to wire a network port so it only not supports printer.

I am in no way anything it related in this company except user, but this was my cue.

I opened my office door and explained wiring of an Ethernet port as simple as I could. Further, I made an educated guess, why the new printer wouldn't get connected to the authentication and print server. At the time, I was talking about VLANs, TB was looking at me, as if I was talking Mandarin. I suggested that he needed to contact our corporate Helpdesk that they adjust the VLANs on the ports of the switch.

He didn't contact the corporate helpdesk, because ET and his assistant EA where in the building to finish the last patch panels.

After some blind guessing, we somehow figured out that one port in the office across the hallway seemed to have the right VLAN assigned. Now we just needed to redo that one patch...   
Easy, right? Well... The port wasn't labeled.

After some discussion someone suggested to pull plugs out of the patch panel one after another, until the link light on the printer goes dark. We all agreed to it and I was about to go upstairs to look at the printer, as TB ment9that he has no signal on his cellphone.

Tje patch panel is in the basement of this quite old building with walls and ceilings full of steel. The Printer was two stories above.

In the end ET was at the panel. EA was in the stairwell at the bottom. TB was in the stairwell on my level and I was sitting next to the printer.

ET would yell ""now?""
EA would yell ""now?""
TB would yell ""now?""
 I would yell ""still lit""
TB would yell ""still lit""
EA would yell ""still lit""
ET would plug the plug back into the panel, would pull the next plug and would yell ""now?""

After 20 something tries we found the right port and were able to bring the printer online.

947,Power cables don't go in your mouth,"I was working for a large cable tv/high speed internet provider and got a call from a residential user that had internet issues and a few too many drinks.  After a little bit of chatting and verifying information I was having the guy power cycle his cable modem.  He had to lay under his desk to get to the modem for some weird reason ??

Well, he also took my instructions of power cycling his modem to the extreme to unplug all 3 cables from the back of it, coax, rj45, and power.  Not in that order.  I guess he needed a free hand and out of bad decision making he decided to hold the power cable with his teeth/mouth.  

After hearing a scream and a thump he started cursing a lot.  Well, he was under his desk so when his wife came into the room she angrily asked who he was talking to, to which he said tech support.  I guess she didn't see the phone and didn't know what was going on so assumed she was being cussed at.  It turned into a verbal domestic situation and I disconnected the call shortly after.

I always (pro tip) look-up who I'm about to meet, to see who they are. This *researcher* was a *networking security scientist*. Their network wasn't working and *they* couldn't figure-out why.

Having had setup a few consumer-grade switches and hubs, I had a rudimentary knowledge of basic networking. You know, make sure all the wires are attached at each end, the little springy clips have to be engaged, LEDs light-up when things are working, that sort of stuff.

So, when I get assigned THIS ticket, I'm thinking; this is going to be *embarrassing*. What the Hell am I going to be able to do for a *NETWORKING F'n SCIENTIST*?!?!?

I go to their office, sweating, and THANK GOD, they weren't there. I see wires running all around the edge of the office, all kinds of networking gear pulled-out, ports lit-up but not flashing, and one 5-port hub had none of the ports lit-up at all. Huh.

Looking a bit closer, I see the hub has a power cord pulled-out from the back by several inches. Probably troubleshooting and removed power for some reason... I plug it back-in.

EVERYTHING lights-up! I verify that there's connectivity to the corporate network, and my work is... *done? Riiight, CAN'T. BE. THIS. EASY.*

""Well, looking around, I saw that the hub was un-powered and the cord was pulled-out from the back. Plugging it back-in did the trick. I was really concerned that it was going to be something to difficult to troubleshoot!"" I smiled bigly.

She replied ""Well,... I can't... believe that I didn't... well, uh, thanks!""

949,Definitely a developer job!,"First story from me, might be a bit long but hopefully not too dull.

So, doing a short stint heading up 'digital' at a small but renowned local company. 
We do a lot of work with a huge international broadcaster, and *they* distribute programs to satellite TV.

They got in touch for a favour. We normally deal with technical briefs and design work but this is an odd one - head of design(HOD) says yep no problem.

So the issue is - when our client sends a new TV show over to a satellite TV company, they sent over an accompanying graphic/show logo which is used for 'coming up next' style overlays and I think in the EPG.

It's a pretty archaic format, its a low Res gif format with a 32 colour palette that must have certain colours in it. Now normally they use an ancient Mac with some 90s software on to create this file but, disaster, the machine been retired!

So armed with this minimal knowledge and a couple of examples I said, well, ok - we just need to configure Photoshop and they can generate this no problem.
 I ping it back to the HOD and say, look it's a photoshop job, give it your best guy for a day to look at.

He's not happy but gives it to the guy, who does, well, nothing. 
I come in early to an arsey email from HOD cc'ing in the MD etc etc - ""it's a Dev job"", not possible etc etc

Classic *FFS right FINE* - boot up Photoshop at 8am (god knows why it was on my machine, years since I used it) - some googling and testing and 1 hour later I sent over 12 point instructions with screenshots.

Well, that was a mistake. HOD refused to try it and claimed it didn't work etc etc. I'm pretty busy as I have the next day off so no chance to smooth things over.

I come in after my day off, out of a meeting first thing and the HOD and designer are both over the shoulder of my junior dev (JDEV), muttering complaining etc. Poor JDEV is sweating away!

Turns out they had taken the opportunity *all day yesterday* to try to get my JDEV to build some abortion of script to combine images into the format and bundle the correct pallette of 32 colours etc. He was barely anywhere struggling with installing image libraries, and just couldn't make any progress.

HOD was furious and stormed over ""Your devs are rubbish, this is a simple job! etc etc"".

I respond:
""I've sent instructions that are simple enough for client to follow, and they have the software already. You went behind my back and wasted development time.""

""And finally... JDEV is extremely colourblind; that's why he doesn't know what the hell you're talking about.""",27,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D09BDFA0>
950,The one where it's up to us to fix even though we didn't break it,"I support healthcare software that has interfaces with third parties, e.g. labs, scheduling software, other electronic medical records (EMR) programs, etc.

I got a case saying that data is no longer transferring to a third party after the customer updated the software of the third party. I figured that maybe the customer built a new server for the new version of the third party's software and didn't know how to change the IP we're sending to. Simple enough, right?

The case was put in by Laura (names changed to protect the innocent) and in the case description, she requested that I call Debbie. I figured Laura is some admin telling me to call someone in IT. So, I called Debbie and the phone menu answered. I hung up immediately because it's the third party and I figured that they won't be able to get me into our software to change the IP, or get me on the server that has our software on it, etc.

I called Laura and she asks that I call Debbie anyway. It seems Debbie is going to be able to explain the issue better. But Laura does tell me that they upgraded the third party's software a couple days ago and appointments haven't been reaching the third party since then. She said ""a couple days"" and I thought ""Today is Monday, so it was probably done over the weekend."" 

About this time, the customer's account rep for our company starts sending out emails. Apparently the customer is going crazy (note: I've already talked to them, but okay) and we need to escalate this issue! I put off calling Debbie for a couple minutes and email everyone on the thread that I'm working the issue but just haven't updated the case yet because I'm still working on it. It's NOT being ignored. To my knowledge, the account rep is just doing their job. So, don't think she was angry at me. In fact, I sent her a quick message on Teams to tell her that I'm calling the third party as requested. While we chatted, she mentioned that the customer updated the third party software on Thursday and only now do they consider it an emergency and have submitted a case. So, it's not just one day of missing data. It's three.

I then called Debbie. She explained to me that the issue is not with the transmission of data. They're getting the data from our software. The problem is that the new version of their software only allows 15 characters for a phone number where they used to have a maximum of 20 characters. The phone numbers we are sending are 18 characters and that is keeping their software from processing the data files.

(Note: Yes, this is the US and yes, phone numbers are 10 digits (including area code). But we send ""(111)222-3333CHome"" for instance. That's 18 characters. The interface engine hasn't been updated in a long long time, so yeah, it could be better but I didn't write the code.)

So, they changed their software to accept fewer characters. Didn't tell the customer this before go-live. And now, for some reason, it's up to us to fix it.

As of now, I've made the only change I can to shorten the phone numbers. The 'CHome' part is no longer appended to the number, so that's within their limit. Our software doesn't have a lot of customization of the data, so it's lucky I could do that. New appointments are being accepted. And I resent the appointments created since Thursday, so all the missing data is there on the third party's system.",26,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D09BE040>
951,We're a multi-billion dollar enterprise. We know better than you do. (Hint: no. you don't),"Posting here for the first time in a while, mostly because I want to tell this story.

&#x200B;

Background: A certain large healthcare company ($vendor) offered to migrate us from our on-prem deployment of their software to their environment for a reasonable rate. We agreed because the on-prem server was getting close to retirement, and we were going to migrate them to either a VM or an AWS server soon anyway. There's been no issues with the software or the database itself, and I'm actually quite happy with how it turned out. 

&#x200B;

Main Story

&#x200B;

Where the problem was, was with our interface. See, we have a single practice management software ($PM) that ties together our large, multi-specialty practice and the various EHRs our doctors use to keep their records. The idea is that the $PM is the primary patient database and the EHRs pull data and schedules from it via standard HL7 interfaces. For those not familiar with them, an HL7 interface's messages usually take one of two forms: a text file created by one system and read by another or a message sent by one system to an IP address and port, where another system reads it. Pretty simple, and its what connects the world of healthcare tech. 

&#x200B;

While $vendor was hosted on-prem, a file based interface was pretty easy to accomplish. $PM sends files to a folder on a file server, and $vendor reads them from there. With a server that's not hosted on site, $vendor's people decided that the best thing to do would be to build a VPN tunnel and push the HL7 data to their server via that. Now, we've built out interfaces with outside partners before, primarily to accomplish getting data to and from the labs that test our specimens for us. I've run these projects not once, but half a dozen times in the last 2 years. We tend to do this by sending the message files to our SFTP server and having the other party read them from there via SFTP. It's efficient, HIPPA compliant, and I haven't had a single complaint about it in the 7 years we've been doing this.

&#x200B;

But no. $vendor INSISTED. They fought tooth and nail to get it set up via VPN because to them, that's the easiest way get an interface up and running. So the $PM rep and I decided to try it despite our misgivings. We got a network engineer to setup a site-to-site VPN tunnel on our firewall, tested it to make sure we could connect to $vendor's server, a process that took almost a week due to difficulties getting the $vendor to communicate with the network engineer and went ahead with the migration as planned. We then spent the next two days troubleshooting the HL7 interface because despite messages going out from our end, the $vendor wasn't recieving them. After two days of back and forth, with $vendor's people insisting everything was good on their end (despite us being able to ping their server's IP, telnet their port, and even packet tracing to make sure the HL7 messages were actually leaving our server), I ended up reciveing a message from their lead that basically ammounted to ""actually, we don't know what's wrong and want to do this via SFTP."" Well la-di-frickin-da. 20 minutes later, I have the SFTP configured for them and our $PM has set about reconfiguring the interface to actually do its job. 

&#x200B;

Tl;dr: vendor wants things done their way. Clients knows a way that works for them. Turns out, the client's right.",134,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D09BE0A0>
952,There is a reason people start by asking if it's plugged in.,"My mentor always said to start with the obvious first, because about twenty common things will makes up 50% of all the calls.   
I just got my coffee and sat down when the phone rang in with a call from the queue. The call handler sounded confused and asked confirmation of the default software password. User manager, password manager, it hasn't changed. It wouldn't change for the 20 years we sold the product.   
""Well, I have a customer who just installed the product who can't login.""   
I grabbed the case thinking 'easy kill, I bet he has CAPS LOCK on.' Ten cases a day was considered a solid days work, and I had gotten one already, and it wasn't even 9AM yet.   
So as soon as I had verified his details, I asked him to verify that caps lock wasn't on. He said, ""I'm not dumb, I checked that first."" 

So we went through the routine and nothing worked. The database was there, the install sounded clean. What should have worked just didn't.   


As an hour dragged to two, I finally asked him to uninstall and reinstall, which took a half an hour. Still nothing. We tried pasting the account and password, and spell check didn't bark.   
I did a quick check by installing the same version. It worked fine.   
So we did an install on a new PC at their site at hour three. Same issue.   


Finally I heard him say ""Are there two 'a's in Manager? I'm in! Thanks!"" <Click><Dial tone>   


I stared at my phone in mute shock. He had misspelled the same word the same way for three hours.   


I went back to the queue because I was behind, muttering ""Two A's in manager.""

953,Some Like It Hot,"This story is short, but sweet.

My IT department benefits from having both a front-facing customer desk as well as a back office for hands and feet.  I'm manning the front desk one crisp winter day when an accountant brings in her laptop for support. I greet her as she comes in and she has a noticeable Latin accent (important for later) But her English is excellent so it's not like I'm having trouble understanding her.

 She explains that she's having issues with her PC shutting off randomly while she's working.  I ask how often and she describes it happening every half hour or so.  Hmm, unusual but not unheard of.  So assuming it's some kind of hardware issue I start troubleshooting by running diagnostics, but they come back fine. Whatever, I have her login and try to replicate what she was doing when it last crashed. Time passes and... nothing.  I'm stumped, everything seems to be working as intended.  So we chalk it up to the ghost in the machine being on a smoke break.  

I send her off with the instructions to give me a call should it start acting up again.  sure enough, bout a half an hour later She sends out the SOS.  At this point I'm fairly certain there's something wrong with her setup. I get her desk location and let her know not to touch anything because I'm on my way.  I get to her office and when she lets me I noticed the air seems considerably warmer even though the heat is on for the entire building.  I just write it off as the cubicles being close to a vent or something and move to put a steading hand on her desk so I can lean under to take a look at the outlet.

MISTAKE!

The cubicle desk is surprisingly hot!  I sort of recoil in surprise (which also startled the customer) and bend my knees a bit to try and get another look under the hood. Yep sure enough she's got a personal heater on full blast right underneath her setup! I asked her about it, turns out this lady is from Brazil and our Midwestern Winters are just driving her insane!  I explained to her the amount of heat was likely too much for the CPU and was probably causing The computer to shut down because of it. Trying to be sympathetic I suggested moving the heater out from underneath the desk for now and maybe getting some cheap risers to keep the computer above the desktop since she was working with a docking station anyway.

She swings by later to let us know that moving the heater seemed to resolve the problem.  No word on whether or not she went with the elevated PC suggestion though.",41,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D09BE160>

As most of our clients don't have a clue about computers, they tend to ring us even though we just support the software, we help them as much as possible though.

One day though I received a call from a very clever user who should really have known better. We also supplied this guys PC a few years ago.

He rang up to question why his PC had all of a sudden turned off. My first thought as it was an older PC would be a possible PSU issue but no, it was worse...

As the call went on we tried as much as possible to try and boot it up but in the end it was not having it.

The guy mumbled something about his laptop still working but I didn't register that at the time.... (Fatal error)

I then asked the guy to have a look under the desk and make sure that all of the cables were plugged in correctly.

He then replied 'I'll try but I can't see a lot as all of the lights are off, we had a power cut 15 minutes ago. I'll go get a torch'.

956,"My mom, the non-believer","Literally just got off the phone with my mom helping her out with this one.

My semi-retired mom is working on a Word document that has two Excel spreadsheets embedded into it.  She needs to email this document to her supervisor, but she's afraid that the Excel sheets didn't embed properly when she sent it, and she's panicking because the document is already late as it is.  Because she's semi-retired and mainly uses her smartphone for everything these days instead of her laptop, she's a bit rusty when it comes to Microsoft Office (and Windows for that matter).  So, she asked me for help on how to embed Excel sheets into Word (she's already spent quite a bit of time on YouTube looking up how to do this).

Although my Office knowledge is a bit rusty myself (I use Google Docs/Slides/Sheets for everything these days), I ask her to send me the files, and she sends me the Word file and two Excel files separately.  When I open the Word document, I see that there are several charts which are already embedded, as well as two hyperlinks at the bottom of the document that link directly to the Excel sheets.  I tried to explain to her that the two separate Excel files aren't needed, as there is already Excel data embedded in the Word document.  She insists that the Excel sheets are still needed, as her supervisors need the ability to edit the data, and that the data won't copy over if she emails just the word document.  I come back by saying that the embedded data is editable by right clicking the embedded sheet and clicking ""Edit data"", which opens the data up in Excel as a ""Chart in Microsoft Word"", and they can then save the sheets separately, if desired.  My mom still doesn't believe me, and is getting more and more stressed out.  I finally explain to her that I deleted the separate Excel sheets and re-named the Word document, and the Word document still functioned perfectly (aside from the now-broken hyperlinks at the bottom of the document, which aren't needed anyway).  After a few more back-and forths, with me even offering to email her the now-renamed Word document, she finally says, ""I believe you""

No wonder I have such a high tolerance of users that have both high anxiety and low PC knowledge.  My mom has prepared me quite well for my field in that regard, which is one of the many reasons I still love her to death.

TL,DR:  Mom needs help embedding two Excel sheets in a single Word document; I find that the sheets are embedded just fine; Mom doesn't believe me until I delete the Excel files and explain that the Word doc still works fine.",8,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D09BE280>
957,"Yo dawg, I heard you like surge protectors...","I work as a sysadmin for my county. I started this job not too long ago and haven't been around to every location so I may have new stories under my belt before too long. Today's story is about one of my users' in an admin position.


Today this user called me and alerted me to them having issues with their set up. For most of the county, our users' are using a bigname brand laptop hooked up to a fancy little dock station with two display port monitors that are also from bigname brand. It's actually a sweet set up and allows users' to easily work from home because they can just disconnect the laptop and be on their way.


The user told me that their laptop would randomly freeze up, the dock would turn off, and their displays would go to sleep. No big deal I thought, maybe there's a firmware update that needs to be pushed through and hopefully fix the problem or we just need to swap a cable out or just restart the machine. Nothing major I assumed. 


So I go on a nice brisk walk over there from our department and greet user, who shows me the problem. I note that they had actually described said problem in full detail (yay!). I immediately go to restart the machine first. It goes down and comes back up fine and it seems to be working fine. During this period the user and I are talking about our day and what we did over the weekend when it suddenly hits the fritz again and wigs out in front of me. At this point it definitely seems to be behaving like an issue with power going to the dock, or the dock itself. I ask her to let me back into her area and where it's plugged into and she shows me. 


This is where the horror began. Her dock and monitors were plugged into ye olde beige surge protector. For the sake of this, we'll call it $surge protector 1. The warm orange light indicating its function was not on so I traced the cord to a small compartment area under the right side of her desk, behind the drawer. Inside this compartment, was another surge protector(2). You may already have your hands approaching your face but, there's still more. I noticed there's another multi-pack $surge protector(3) under there too that is ALSO connected to $surge protector 2. $Surge protector 3's main job was to connect the power from the printer... that's right above it. Yes, I too have no idea why this is needed. The power cord was obviously long enough to connect to $surge protector 2. 


In an effort to undo this mess, I decide to tace $surge protector 2's cord and see where the heck that's going (there's lots of shelving in this office where the cables are routed behind). Well, it turns out $surge protector 2 is connected to an *extension cord*. Now, I am by no means an electrical engineer but not only am I sure that connecting two surge protectors together is a bad idea, let alone three, I'm pretty sure you're not supposed to use an extension cord for a surge protector either. Alas, as I am wrapping my head around this, I continue my search for where this journey ends. I end up moving a couple of shelves and find a horrific conclusion. $surge protector 2's extension cord is plugged into... ANOTHER FREAKIN' $SURGE PROTECTOR (4)! 


At this point my feeble brain is trying to peace together this monstrosity of a system and trying to clean it up to the best of my ability. I remove $surge protector 3 from the equation entirely, along with $surge protector 4 as the extension cord could easily make it to the outlet that $surge protector 4 was connected to. However, due to cord lengths, desk orientation, etc... I was only able to configure it so:


$surge protector 1 > $surge protector 2 > extension cord to outlet. This still made me uncomfortable and I requested the user to notify facilities IMMEDIATELY to get new outlets installed in her office and to notify me when they do. In the meantime, she said she'd happily work off just her laptop and a charger connected directly to the outlet in the meantime. 


TL;DR: User had a surge protector jungle because they didn't want to task facilities with installing much needed outlets.

958,"Beset on all sides, by idiots. Except the client, in an unlikely turn of events.","Happened today. The events that unfolded made me feel quite literally like my heart would burst and my head started aching with a sort of cold rage. So, I shall be working for company A, and the other shall be company B.

Client contacts me, saying that they lost their \*document\* and just applied for a replacement(at the site of company B). The two issues are that the tracker says it happened 90+ days ago and so cant be tracked, and that the fee was 28 arbitrary units of money for some reason. Alright, first things first the tracker is just wrong, mostly because this site was made by company B, which is just about the worst IT company ever, in the history of the universe.(So bad that I, at company A, have to inform them as to what their services do and how they work, when I ask for help with fixing them...)

The bigger issue is the fee. 28 is a familiar number, so I check. Yep, it used to be 28, but the law changed it at the start of this year, to 8.5. I even checked with the head of the department who are in charge of knowing this specific thing, and she agreed as well. Alright, two possibilities is a single glitch, or worse but entirely possible considering that company B is involved, they did not notice the change in the laws that their services must observe, they did not update it, and they have been more than triple charging people for half a year now, and this is the first time someone brought it up...

Alright, I can handle this.... reassure the client, ask them to send in the data so we can have this investimagated and fixed. Great. Not half an hour passes and I am contacted by a (very reliable and knowledgeable) colleague, who asks me to check out an email. I assumed I messed something up, so I check. Nope. Its the email from the client. Some guy who I never even heard of, sent out an answer saying that the guy in the chat was wrong, and it is 28... The client even replied, thanking him, and noting how I was wrong in the chat then. Just in case, I ask, and colleague confirms that no, I was correct. The colleague who made the mistake is apparently a hire so new, I have never even seen his name before. I have no idea what the hell he was even doing, handling that email, as it was not even part of his skillset...

I am... rather miffed, to say the least. Fine, the client sent a duplicate. I am busy right now, but transfer that over to my main skillset, I'll get to it ASAP. Just in case, add a note explaining that 8.5 is the correct value, and it has to be forwarded to Company B. Not 5 minutes pass when I check, just in case... The contact has been answered, with a nonsense answer(that I already correctly answered in the chat, btw...) by the same guy. At this point, I was more than a bit miffed...

Not only is some complete noob, who probably only plans to stick around as a summer job, questioning my competence, he is also not even bothering to read the available email templates that show he is wrong. Or the information database we have that would also show it. Or even the contact history, to see what was discussed in the chat, *or* *even* to notice that he has already answered this exact email... Or just... you know... ask someone to make sure... No shame in that...

So yeah... Not taking responsibility or saving asses for that tragi-comedy of errors by trying to fix it, called the superior who was stupefied by the sheer degree of incompetence on display from both company B and the colleague. Another experienced one happened to pass by at the time as well, who was also just staring with a sort of morbid curiosity at this trainwreck.

About the only silver lining in the whole matter, was that unbelievably, the client was the best bit of this whole ordeal. Also, the slice of pizza I stuffed into my facehole afterwards to calm down...",12,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D09BE340>

960,blocking email? please don't,"One of my jobs back in the early 2000s, was running an email server for an academic department at a university.  The Department had been the first to have email and an internet connection, something that had been done way before my time, but some senior researchers thought it was important to keep our own ""identity"" rather than migrate to the campus wide system.

Our campus network group was struggling with security and was implementing various fixes, including complex ACLs at the network boundary.    At some point they asked all the systems people on campus to provide IP addresses for all outward facing servers and what ports needed to be open so they could block traffic they didn't like.  I actually ran a firewall between my group and them so I used my rules to make a quick list and sent it to them.  

Nothing happened for a while but then I started getting reports of mail traffic seeming to be throttled.  I started checking our mail logs and actually caught an instance where inbound traffic stopped EXCEPT for mail servers that were on campus.  I checked with the network guys and finally got someone who explained they were trying to implement an ACL for port 25, but our mail server should be allowed.  I explained what I was seeing, they agreed to check into it, but they were ""just testing"".  For the next week or so the interruptions would randomly happen, I would call them to complain, they would apologize.  I requested numerous times that they notify me any time they were testing so I could give them instant feedback that their ACL was broken, and help keep my users off my back.  I couldn't get them to agree to this, but hey, I tried.

The incidents tapered off after a while so I figured they had figured it out, or maybe given up.  Then one Saturday one of my more vocal users called me at home.  He was not receiving external email.  I SSH in start poking around, I can see we are not getting traffic from outside, and it looks like we haven't since the previous night.  I call the ""emergency"" number for network problems.  Tech calls me back but he has nothing to do with the ACLs, he's there in case there's a major outage or something similar.  I discuss with him, he takes my home number and says he'll escalate.  I say fine.   I get a call, pretty quickly, from the main networking guy (MNG).  I tell him what I'm seeing:

MNG:  ""I want to be clear that this issue has nothing to do with our ACL""

me:  ""I'm not saying it is, I'm saying it \*looks like\* the ACL, but maybe its something else""

MNG:  ""Okay as long as we're clear on that""

me: ""maybe you could disable the ACL for a second to see if anything changes""

MNG:  ""Its not the ACL, I'm not going to do that""

I'm tailing my mail logs in one terminal window while I poke around, I can hear him typing in the background.   Every once in a while he asks if anything changes, I tell him no.  After about five minutes he stops asking me if I've seen any change, its all quiet on the phone.   Suddenly I see my mail logs show traffic from outside.  

me:  ""Hey, it looks like its OK, let me check"".  

I send myself email from an outside account and it gets delivered to my Dept account!

me:  ""Hey, thanks MNG, looks like its fixed!  That's great!   What did you do?""

<pause>

MNG:  ""I disabled the ACL""

me:  ""can we leave it disabled until Monday?  When was it turned on anyway?""

MNG:  ""ACL guy turned it on Friday night, he didn't want to disturb folks during business hours""

me:  ""maybe testing should be done \*during\* business hours?  Just in case?""

MNG:  ""Yeah.  I'll talk to him""

MNG sounded kind of depressed but I was just happy to have the problem solved.  MNG was one of the most responsive and capable people on campus so there was not point in doing a ""superior dance"", he felt bad enough about the incident.

It took me a while to get the whole story, the ACL in question was apparently huge and they were entering it all on a command line.  Very easy to make a mistake, at least that was the reason they gave me.  It was clear they needed a better tool than a switch ACL.  I think they were able to get funding for a real high bandwidth firewall after this.",28,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D09BE400>

1. &#x200B;

Lady: ""They installed the pad wrong.""

Me: ""...What?""

L: ""The text I got said the code is thirty-two thirty-two, but there's no thirty-two. There's only twelve and thirty-*four*.""

Me: ""...It. It's not thirty-two thirty-two. It's *three two three two.*

L: ""Well there's none of *that* either!""

I proceeded to have to go down and physically show her how it worked. Twice.

L: ""Well that's stupid. It's unnecessarily confusing. I'm going to submit a complaint.""

Me: ""You do that.""

2.

Man: ""Hey the pad's broken or something. The code doesn't work.""

Me: *Here we fucking go.* ""Did you input *all four numbers* and then press the *enter* key afterwards?""

Man: ""**Yes!** I'm not stupid you know.""

Me: *I really, really doubt that.* ""Try it one more time while on the phone with me. I'd rather not go down if I don't have to.""

The pad lets out a very loud beep whenever a button is pressed. As a result, I could hear his next attempt, if you could call it that, quite clearly.

***\*Beep. Beep.\****  
\*Long pause\*  
**\*Beep.\***  
\*angry door rattling\*

Man: ""It still won't open! I'm telling you, the damn thing's broken!""

Me: \*sighs\* ""I'll come down.""

&#x200B;

I hate people.

Edit: After many, many comments all agreeing on the same thing, I've made a decision.The next time that management comes to complain about people leaving the door unlocked, I'm going to tell them that it's a terribly designed lock, and they should get a better one if they don't want people finding their own solutions to the problem.

Edit 2: I have completed my final shift for this week. As of this evening, it is *officially* broken; Courtesy of a pissed off user while I was off-site dealing with other problems. Apparently there was a wiring issue in it to begin with, which was why people could press the middle of the button and it would read it as being the 'correct' number despite them not actually pressing the correct half of the button.

Management has mixed feelings about this, because on one hand it is therefore under warranty, on the other, they now have a lot of pissed off employees saying ""I told you so.""

They have ignored my requests to please, for the love of god, not replace it with an identical lock of the same make and model.

They have also denied my requests to:

A: Make a sign,

B: Tell users that the password is four two digit numbers instead of the 'actual' four digit pin, (which, after the wiring revelation, was the only denial that made sense to me.)

C:  Change the PIN to something that didn't use both halves of a button,

D: Wire up the new lock to the automated door system so I can just unlock it from my office.

I am so glad that this next week is Not My Problem.

Not as glad as I am to be leaving this building and all of its dumb-ass management in a couple months, but still pretty happy none the less.

I think management might just be getting a kick out of watching me suffer at this point, honestly.",281,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D09BE460>
962,The definition of insanity,"I actually have a tech repair shop role so I no longer am tech adjacent like I have been in my previous posts.

\*insert level up graphic and sound effect here\*

So the place I now work at repairs mostly phones but we also do a bit of everything. Enter the customer who is the literal definition of insanity: doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results. I'll call him PicNick or PN for short(In this case replace the traditional chair with customer and computer with cell).

So PN comes in on a busy morning about two weeks ago when I'm working on checking people in. Anyway, he explains he is getting popups/adware on his phone(Which, in my opinion takes skill. Its not a particularly useful or helpful skill but it is a talent and mildly impressive). I am new(I will officially have worked here for a month on this upcoming Monday), so I forget to get the unlock passcode, and this particular type of phone doesn't prompt me for that in the check in process.  Anyway I tell him it will be a couple hours, and we will call back when we have news/a quote. Two things to know about Nick.

1. He likes to talk. Because I am female I believe he was more polite and because it was at the beginning of this saga he actually lets me get in the words I need to understand what the problem is and check him in.
2. He's an older gentleman who very much gives off the I don't like change vibe.

At this point none of us know what a saga this will be. Unfortunately it turns out we need to factory reset his phone but if we get his passcode we may be able to help transfer his data first. PN refuses to give us the passcode and comes to pick it up we we can not do anything. Usually after some patient explaining most folks understand and either leave to go get a new phone, take it to get the data and bring it back to reset, or just leave empty handed. Not this guy.

Over the next day or so PN calls:

The company that makes his phone, his carrier, I think the store that rhymes with west guy or something like that(I was off for those two days), and basically shouts and is a belligerent, unfriendly, pushy delight to all three. The big box store actually resets and then restores the phone but whatever caused the adware to appear in the first place is reinstalled so same issue. Nick calls again the next day I am  in and my boss, very patiently, explains that the phone needs to be factory reset, and cannot have all the apps restored for the above mentioned reason.

Rinse and repeat the above for the next week and a half. With varying reiterations of you need to factory reset it, different coworkers either saying they will stay late or come in on their days off to help him reset it, and others listening to at least half an hour tirades about the issues and what to do. I think a couple of the calls were like two hours of this guy rambling. Basically we are pretty much done with Nick because he will not do what we told him to do, and we are done with him at all three area locations.

**BUT WONDER OF ALL WONDERS:** he actually brought it in Thursday evening to one of the other locations to get it factory reset.

Normally this is where the story would end; said other local location even blacklisted him after they reset it. But oh no. Between the saga of phone calls in which he continues to ask what to do, gets the same answer, and not do it, he had changed carriers. Which now results in his phone no longer connecting to the network. It sometimes happens that way and there is legit nothing anyone can do. Particularly with the carrier he switched to. I am too new to know why this particular carrier is special but it's something I've been warned about.

So cue this gem of a conversation I overheard today while I was in the back repairing a screen under the watchful eye of the aforementioned boss(Still learning so he answers questions/gives me help and tips as I work on said phone).

>Boss: Thank you for calling ""Store Name"", what can I help you with today?  
>  
>PN: Hi, I'm calling because my phone no longer wants to connect to the network, and your other location must be very busy because I can't get ahold of anyone there. (blacklisting means he can still call and leave messages but it doesn't ring in this case)  
>  
>Boss: Ah yes, I think I recognize your voice. Unfortunately if the factory reset doesn't fix that issue, like you did yesterday, then there is nothing we can do.  
>  
>PN: But I like this phone. Its been a good phone up until the adds started popping up. It works well for me and they went away last night, but now it won't connect to the network. Can't you fix it?  
>  
>Boss: \*Places on speaker so he can help me with something as he chats to Nick\* I understand, but as I said before there is nothing we can do. You need to get a new phone through your new carrier.

And rinse and repeat for about 5-10 minutes in which Nick basically says the exact same thing in different phrasing. Meanwhile, all of us are attempting not to laugh because ye gods he keeps going on and on and we have been dealing with him for two weeks now. Eventually the boss gets DONE and falls completely silent and eventually the guy says okay bye and hangs up. PN would have continued forever if he hadn't done that.  Cue everyone laughing at his ridiculous mannerisms and praising said boss's clever way of hanging up/""dropping"" the call. AND we still aren't done for:

* My boss's manager/manager of the three local stores including our own calls shortly after and instructs my boss to blacklist him at this store. Also to let my boss vent.
* PN actually makes an appointment for later on. We obviously decline it.
* Those messages he kept leaving at the first store that blacklisted Nick? They are, for all we know, in morse code. I think we got busy and had to stop trying to translate before we could plug it into something to figure out what the knocks meant. I'll edit if they mean anything.

So yeah, this is where the saga ends for now. Will edit if it develops further, but I think he's blacklisted in all three locations so he would have to come in physically to continue to complain and ramble our ears off.

**TLDR:** The living breathing definition of insanity will not follow directions and expects different results.",74,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D09BE4C0>
963,Attempt at Ticket Stat Padding Leads to Egg on Face,"This story is from several years ago, back in my IT help desk days.  I was reminded of this by an unrelated thread in another subreddit and thought I would share it here.

I used to work in an IT help desk job with someone who was a bit of a bully.  He'd do petty stuff like take my keyboard and either replace it with his dirty one (keyboards he used over time always became disgusting) or he'd just leave me with no keyboard.  This guy was also the lowest performing member of our office, by far.  Everything we did for users was documented in our ticketing system; our boss (who was awesome) said it was important to document our usefulness.  So, when you looked up our stats, it was obvious who was performing and who wasn't.  

In our ticketing system, we had a bunch of old tickets that had been self-resolved by users that were still flagged as ""open"" but we all knew they were no longer in need of attention.  Whenever we, the help desk workers, would resolve an issue we'd close the ticket as ""resolved"" after having first assigned it to ourselves.  If a user ended up not needing help anymore, we could just cancel the ticket without assigning it first.  I'm not sure why the tickets in question in this story were never cancelled out, but our boss asked us to go through them and cancel them if they no longer required our attention.  We all knew that we were to CANCEL them, not assign them to ourselves and mark them as RESOLVED.  We all knew the difference between the two.

This guy decided to assign dozens of these tickets to himself in one day, assign them to himself, and mark them as resolved.  I saw this happening from within our ticketing program.  He later made a comment about how his resolved tickets for the week were above the office average, as if he had been helping a ton of users.

Sun Tzu wrote that, when an adversary is making a mistake, you should be careful not to interrupt them.  The bully apparently didn't know something that I did know: Each RESOLVED ticket has a 1/3 chance of sending the user a survey.  So, dozens of users were sent surveys asking them about the job this guy did helping them with an issue he never actually helped them with.  Our boss then received dozens of emails from confused users.  This all played out just as I knew it would the moment he started bullshitting all of those tickets.

This is how the office bully got egg on his face.",43,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D09BE520>
964,"""You remind me of my son - He passed away last year""","This happened yesterday. Just want to showcase that sometimes we can really impact people in a positive way and it isn't all ""restarts and plug-ins"". 

I was working with a lady, troubleshooting Citrix Desktop on a personal computer while at home. I was a little hamstringed going into things because our workplace tends to use company computers that I can always remote into, ping, troubleshoot much more accurately. But we also dig the whole ""work from anywhere with any device"" model. 

That said, I did my best and we eventually got her squared away. Toward the end of our conversation she mentioned that I sounded like her son and asked for my age. I told her that I'm 24 and she paused for a moment, apologized, and said that he was 25 and passed away last year due to aggressive leukemia. He was her personal at-home IT guy, moreover he was her son. She felt like, for one last time, he was helping her figure things out and talking her through the steps.

Afterward I cried and texted my mom that I love her

965,When the user is smart enough to configure a firewall but not smart enough to know how it works,"The company I do desktop support for has two VPN connections.
One is for a work supplied device which gives them full functionality and the other is a split system tunnel connection on their own personal device that allows them to RDP to a device on the LAN

Recently due to COVID and the influx of people working from home, we have started doing support for personal devices and connecting to them to the VPN and RDP

99% of them have been due to their firewall blocking the RDP port. I get that most people have no idea and need help allowing it through

I had one caller who was a nice lady and put me on to her partner as he is my computer literate

Me: Hi, what issue are you having? 
Him: we are able to connect to the VPN but cannot RDP or connect to the PC at her office

I checked and the work device is online, ping able etc 

Me: no problem, I can connect in with logmein to see your device and see what is happening 

Him: nope that won't work. My router will block it

Me: are you sure? I can at least try and see if it works 

Him: no it won't work! I have set up and configured my VIP reception firewall so I know what is allowed in and out. My firewall will block it. 

*thinking to myself* logmein uses port 443 so I am very sure he hasn't blocked that! 

Me: OK so in my experience it's most often a firewall issue. Cam you disable your firewall for just a minute and test it? 

Him: no I am not doing that. It's not a firewall issue. I can connect to other devices fine

Me: other devices? You're able to connect with the remote desktop app? 

Him: no team viewer. I can use teamviewer fine so it can't be a firewall problem! 

Me: OK well teamviewer uses a different port than remote desktop so it's possible that it is just blocked. All you have to do is disable it for a minute and tell me if it connects! 

This went on for a few minutes and before I gave up

Me: if you don't want to do any testing I am afraid I can't help you any further. We provide limited support for your own devices. 

Him: OK fine I have just turned it off and will show you that it still doesnt work

A few seconds pass...

Him: OK that is weird it connects now. What have you done? 

Me: nothing from my end, it was just your network blocking the connection 

I gave him the default RDP number port and he added the rule in his firewall. no issues once he turned it  back on

Him: great thanks for your help.

TLDR: a user configured a locked down perimeter firewall on their own network and didn't think it would stop RDP working",34,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D09BE5E0>

967,Just to be on the safe side ...,"Back when RAM was much more expensive than it is now, an application administrator was dealing with a performance issue. After investigation, he concluded that the problem was a memory shortage on the VM hosting it. He estimated what the application would need, adding a little bit on the top to be on the safe side. He then talked to the team lead, saying we need this much extra RAM.

The TL then talked to the project manager and asked for extra RAM, adding a little bit to the application admin's figure - just to be on the safe side.

The PM then talked to the OS support guy (me) and asked for extra RAM, adding a little bit to the TL's figure - just to be on the safe side.

I  added some RAM to the VM - with a bit extra over the PM's figure, just to be on the safe side.

A while later, the application admin and I were comparing notes and discovered that what he'd been given was way more than he'd asked for - and realised every step in the chain had added a bit extra. I'm a bit fuzzy on the details now - it's been a while. But I think the numbers were something like: application needed 6GB, VM got 11GB.",48,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D09BE6A0>
968,point of sale problems,"Got a call one morning from a store manager complaining that the store was supposed to open in about 5 minutes and none of the registers would open.

I asked that he go to the computer room and tell me what lights he sees on the computer racks that contain the computers, networking equipment and UPSs.

He tells me that there aren't any lights.  even the room was dark.

Suggested that he turn the room lights on and then verify that the computer racks are plugged in as well as their dedicated circuit breakers are on.

The breakers are on but the racks are unplugged.  There is an industrial coffee maker plugged into the computer outlets.

The stockers that come in at midnight would unplug the computers and then plug in the coffee machine (don't need the computers to stock shelves or clean floors).  Then unplug the coffee machine and plug the computer racks back in when they leave.

That morning, they forgot.

Had the store manager unplug the coffee machine and plug the racks back in.  In about a minute the network equipment started coming up and about a minute or two later the computers started.  That enabled the registers to open and they could service the patrons.

Told the store manager to get an electrician out there to put in another circuit (not on the backup generator) just for the coffee machine.

No more problems.

There have been some interesting questions posted below.  I will try to answer some of them here.

This was in the days before Electronic Shelf Tags, so the night stockers had to have access to the room to print and get shelf tags.

The store manager did not get the electrician out there, but I did generate the work order to have it done.  So no more midnight outages.  The electrician also moved the coffee maker out into the hall so it was not next to the computer and network equipment.",19,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D09BE700>
969,Let's Make A Plan and Start Calling For Buy-in,"To give some background.. A year ago my leader mentioned that he would like to transition off an inherited SSO implementation to Azure SSO in the next three years. FFWD to 5/3/21, three months ago, our SSO account rep reaches out and reminds us of the upcoming renewal due 7/30/21. With COVID we've been cutting back on annual expenses and want to save the money, so my leader said cutover by that date. 

72 configured applications for 25 different systems with 21 different user groups and requiring 90% or higher company-wide Microsoft MFA enrollment was my self-defined success criteria. With how slow healthcare IT is for changes.. impossible, right? Fuck it, let's make a plan and start calling for buy-in.

I draft up a simple cutover plan, listing which apps on what dates grouped by tier, user group and expected complexity. Also write down who I need on as my A-Team, and who I need buy-in from.

So I start calling up my fellow system admins. Conversations went like this ""My leader wants to switch to Microsoft SSO by 6/30, I need you on-board. I'll handle all change control, cutover config, communication, and support; just need your buy-in."" ""That's a pretty aggressive timeline, but if you can do it, let's do it."" Cool, I've got the sysadmins on-board. 

Time to call second-tier business owners. HR, Pharma/Healthcare admins, and such. Conversations go like ""I've done some math, our SSO system costs the company 500k a year on employee-login time, renewal, server time and support. We are switching SSO providers, and are not renewing. If you'd like your application login to still function, I need you to agree to X timeline."" ""What do I need to do?"" ""I'll handle it all, just need your written buy-in."" Cool, I've got the second-tier owners on board.

Last calls of that day were to my A-team. The service desk manager, architect and IT marketing guy. All on-board.

The next day, for completeness I setup a call with a VAR to see if they could handle the project. They sold us the original SSO product, and tout their M365 expertise all the time. The conversation was sub-par, and the quote for the work was two years of the renewal cost.. Yeah, if the project didn't complete we could ""blame them"", but that is a mindset for the weak. This is the point where I knew we had to handle all in-house.

Over the next weeks it was documentation, CCB, implementation, and scripting.

With all healthcare systems, we have many regulations and bureaucratic hoops to deal with. Authentication is a major part of non-repudiation, so I had to comb through all our audited procedures and get them updated. Thankfully I was able to delegate some of that work.

Change control went smooth except for the first one. The manager of IT Project Managers pipped up when I was explaining the breadth of this project, its effects, and timeline. Long story short, they didn't like that I didn't request a PM that was going to have no idea what to do, and that we didn't have a vendor to fall back on ""to blame"".

Implementation was all smooth, even for applications used by every employee. I tell you what.. the technical gymnastics I implemented to make a smooth HR cutover was a proud moment. The hiccup is when we got to the MFA required applications. Remote access.

This whole time, my A-team had been communicating to end users about the cutover, and the requirements around MFA. Handling any and all issues, and providing exceptional support. Week 1, jump from 1% to 40% enrollment. Week 2-5, up to 50%. We needed 90% MFA enrollment by week 7. I had built a script to help visualize enrollment, and create a distro of those not enrolled. So day after day we blast those who haven't enrolled, communicating procedure and deadline. 

Week 7 we are at 75%. Thank god week 8 wasn't the actual deadline! I've still got 4 weeks to get this done. 

Week 8 - these people just don't want to enroll; pushed my timeline back for remote access apps. Time to alert their managers. Modify my script to pull their manager too. Write a new script to blast an email to the managers detailing % of their team enrolled, and name those who haven't enrolled. 85% enrollment.

Week 9 - working for the last 5%, and I start 2 weeks of PTO next week (why I wanted an 8 week implementation). Blast another email to the managers warning them of potential work-stoppage, and the people specifically. Managers were obviously not happy with their employees. Jumped to 96% enrollment. Time to cutover.

Week 10 - I'm going on PTO y'all. Bout time to document and have our first official meeting. We set responsibilities, walk through what is left, who to talk to and how to implement, passed mostly to my architect. As expected, implementation hiccups.

Week 11 - Fixing hiccups and standing up some internal architecture for Citrix.

Week 12 - Full remote access SSO+MFA implementation. The 4% not enrolled are mad, but they had months of warning. 

Week 13 - Everything is done, and we the sysadmins are happy. HR was surprised it went so smooth, and our CIO and CISO is over the moon about the SSO implementation.

&#x200B;

The only thing I will change in the future is more delegation. Hopefully the skills in my team will be up to par to handle the aggressive timelines we are consistently expected to achieve by that time.

970,The Largest Magnet in the World,"**UPDATE: Please see the reply from SeanBZA below. His explanation for the data deterioration is much simpler and, honestly, makes more sense in regards to the issue the customer was facing.**  


I did field work in the early nineties. Back then, some data centers still had VAX machines, dumb terminals, and reel-to-reel backups (Think 1960's era stock footage of computers and big disks spinning around. Those things.) Those devices were old & slow & breaking down & obsolete, so a \*lot\* of them were replaced in the 1990's. My company sold and installed the replacement tape drives.This customer was porting old backups to the new backup drives. They had been one of the first adopters of computer technology back in the day, and had backups going back, I kid you not, to the late 1960's. The oldest of these backups (early-mid 70's, if memory serves) might or might not port over. Even though it was out of our scope, the customer asked if our company could figure out what was going on.

I, as the installing tech, did the preliminary checking, which consisted of learning how their old drives worked. It was data-gathering for the guys who probably knew how this old stuff worked. This was the first and last time I had ever seen one of these old tape drives in use.

The upper-level techs did some environmental checks, didn't think their storage was any issue (it was in an old, giant, 100+ year old safe from a defunct bank), tested the drives as best they could, and couldn't find an issue with them. We told them we couldn't figure out what was wrong and the customer thanked us for trying.

(Why did they need these old backups some 25-30 years later? This customer was SUPER GIANT CONGLOMERATE that you've heard of, and they probably \*still\* have legal battles being fought from the 1960's. That is my best guess, and I assure you it is only a guess, but it's the only possible reason I could think of.)

Fast forward 5 or 6 years. I no longer work for my previous employer and I was watching some TV. No idea what the show was but it had something to do with magnetism, and I watched as they magnetized a rebar by using the Earth's magnetic field. The rebar was pointed at the ground at about a 45-degree angle, oriented N-S, then struck with a hammer a half-dozen or so times. The now slightly-magnetized rebar picked up some very small paperclips.

I flashed back to that customer and their very old, very constructed of iron mag tape storage safe, and I was damn near blinded by the light bulb going off over my head.

I had to know.

At work the next day, during lunch, I cold-called the local office of SUPER GIANT CONGLOMERATE and asked for the IT Department. I got the local help desk and started by explaining, ""I did a service call there about six or seven years ago on some tape drives. I know this is really, really weird, but is there anyone still there who might remember how you guys couldn't port over reel-to-reel backups to the new drives?""

""What are you talking about?"" the tech on the phone asked, reasonably. I gave the tech the story above without the TV show, and also asked if they still have the old safe in the data center in the basement.

I think it was that bit of info that got me a, ""Let me get your phone number and I'll ask around."" I thought that was the end of it, but a couple of hours later my phone rang. It was one of the Admins from SUPER GIANT CONGLOMERATE calling me back.

He was one of the deskside grunts at the time my old company investigated the issue; he was still with the company but had kept going to school, got his Netware certs, and was now an admin. And he remembered the tape drive issue. ""I think I remember you,"" he said. ""Were you the guy who installed the new drives?"" I said I was but I no longer work for that company, but I think I know what's wrong. ""You've been thinking about this for five years?"" he asked, laughing.

""No, but something reminded me about it last night, and...you know, I'd just like to have this checked out. It would certainly explain everything. I have a test in mind. It's fast and painless and should only take about as long as it takes to open and close the door to that safe."" He asked for details and I told him. ""That safe is made of iron, right? I remember how everyone liked it because it was over 100 years old and could probably withstand a nuclear blast, but it's still made of iron, and for 100 years it's been sitting on a big, big, BIG magnet.""

He was silent for a moment, then said, ""I don't follow you.""

""You know if you leave a paperclip on a magnet the paperclip becomes magnetized? Well, that safe has been sitting around on the Earth for over 100 years, and the Earth is a....""

""Magnet,"" he finished. ""Oh, wow. oh, wow."" Pause. ""What's your test?""

I suggested he get a small paperclip, make sure it isn't magnetized, then take it to the safe, open it up, and see if they could hang the paperclip to the top of the safe from the inside. He told me he'd call me back in ten minutes.

About 8 minutes later, my phone rang. ""That paperclip is still hanging in that safe. I guess we need new storage. Thanks for your help!"" and I think I could hear the faint sounds of people frantically removing tapes from a safe behind him.

971,Classic case of PEBKAC,"When I got my first job in IT I worked in a team supporting a government mainframe system. Our government were just getting into the idea of external consultancies doing work because they were ""better"" than the government employees. The net result of this was we were faced with an annual intake of sparkly faced kids with degrees in geography or business studies arriving as ""consultants"" working for one of the largest global consultancies at the time. They would arrive, go through an induction for about 6 weeks, disappear to the States for a ""COBOL Programming Course"" for another 6 weeks at which point they would arrive back and you would find they were your boss.

I was saddled with one who kept calling me for somewhat spurious reasons. The one that is indelibly burned into my memory was the ""enter key not working"" issue. On this day, ${""manager""} was running some user testing on the system and the instructions were pretty clear, you filled in the test data from the script (yes there was a paper script, we are talking the late 80's here) and then you hit the action key to move to the next page. Note, the action key on this particular flavour of mainframe was where you would see the backspace key on a modern PC keyboard. The key just below this had a very different function and could be mapped in the terminal settings applied when a user logged in. 

On the particular day I had a large number of calls about an issue with one of our line printers. It was apparently spitting out endless sheets of fanfold paper with the same information on it. One of the users had fed the printer with 4 boxes of fanfold and had neatly stacked the 4 boxes of output ready for collection. I logged into the system and checked the print spool, it was full with hundreds of pending print jobs, all the same size and all tagged with ${""manager""} as the owner. I disabled printing, cleared the spool and restarted the scheduler and sure enough jobs started to be added for ${""manager""} again. Time to go and see them.

I looked round the office, spotted ${""manager""} and went over. Immediately I was told ""the mainframe is broken"", a rather odd statement to come from a ""manager"" for a global IT consultancy. You would expect a little more technical detail at least. On questioning what the issue was I was told no matter how many times the hit the enter key, nothing was happening. Everything suddenly fell in place. My next question was ""have you read the user manuals for this application?"", I knew full well they had not. In the manuals you were told that the key labelled ""action"" was the equivalent of ""enter"" on this mainframe terminal. There was also a very handy keyboard map diagram showing the action key and also telling users that the key below the action key was mapped to print screen. 

I said ""you've been printing the same screen over and over again"". This was met with a flat denial and ${""manager""} started to have a go at me in a very loud voice. Now I've never been one to take crap from anyone, especially an inept arrogant fool promoted beyond their level of ability. I turned round, went to the printers, grabbed a barrow, put the 4 boxes of wasted fanfold on the barrow, got all the additional sheets from the printer and added them to the boxes, walked back and said ""yes, you have. Here are 4 boxes of fanfold along with a number of additional sheets all screen prints from your terminal."" Their response was classic, ""how can you prove it's from my terminal"". The answer to that was very simple. Every users name was included on the printouts and it appeared on every single sheet. I took great pleasure in going through every single box pointing to their name over and over again. 

That would not be my last encounter with them, but they were shifted into a role where they had no responsibility for a team.",35,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D09BE820>
972,Crazy lady demands assistance with a product we don't sell,"A woman submitted an email ticket for help accessing her account. Ok, easy stuff. I reply, ask her her username, but can't find it in the database. She insists its correct so I ask her to send a screenshot of the error notification she's receiving. When she does, I notice she's trying to login in to some random website I've never even heard of. I have no idea how she ended up with *our* contact information. I tell her the site she's trying to access isn't a product of our company and to reach out to their customer support. I then closed the ticket. 

But alas, that's not the end. She calls in to the support line and I happen to be the one to answer the phone. After I say ""Thank you for calling *anonymous medical company*, this is *HoungryHoungryHippo*, how can I help you?"", she responds with ""is this the *HoungryHoungryHippo* who refused to help me get access to my account?"". And I immediately know this is going to be a fun call. 

She basically **insists** that its *my* job to get access to her account. My response is that its not because she's asking about a product we don't even sell. She says she's not hanging up until I help her so I relent and Google the software, find their customer support number, and attempt to give it to her. After I recite the number, she goes silent for a couple seconds, and then says ""What do I do with this? I called YOU for a reason! Why are you trying so hard to avoid doing what you get paid to do?"". I asked her what hospital she works for and I did notice that they **do** have an account with some of our products, except the product she was needing help with isn't one of ours. I tell her this and she just isn't grasping it. 

I finally get pissed off and say ""Ma'am, this is not a product we sell. There's nothing I can do aside from pass of their contact number"" and she says ""Well, we're going to sit here all day because I'm not getting off this line until I'm helped"". 

I chuckle a little to myself and hang up. 

She immediately calls back. I see it on the caller ID and decide to just let it ring for a bit to see if she gives up. I alert the other techs and after a good laugh at her expense, my manager picks up the phone. He tells her the same thing I did and again, she insists on ""being helped"". After she whines some more, he tells her there's no assistance we can offer with a product we don't sell and hangs up, again. 

That's the end of her tirade, right? 

Nope. 

She then begins spamming the chat. I closed the first one immediately and she opened a new one. I finally called the hospital she worked for and thankfully someone else picked up the phone. I asked to speak to a manager, told her what happening, and she apologized and insisted it would stop. The lady immediately quit spamming us. I hope she was immensely embarrassed when she finally realized she was an idiot calling the wrong number. Her final send off was giving me a 1/5 rating on the initial email ticket she submitted. 

Legend has it, she to this day has yet to gain access to her account.",294,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D09BE880>
973,Hard Drives? What Hard Drives?,"Ok, to set the scene...I work with the DoD so we have pretty strict procedures when it comes to the decommissioning of equipment.  About three months ago we receive an intern.  This intern had about six months to go (now three) on his tour of duty and decided he wanted to get into IT.  He signed up for an internship through the military and before you know it he's walking in our door eager to do the computer things.

His job was to take updates from a secure network and install them in fighter planes.  That's it.  Update goes from A to B, if there were any problems he was to contact someone else.  He has no experience in troubleshooting, desktop support, server support, IT security, no formal IT education, and with the exception of the Sec+ cert he was given years ago by the military he has no professional certifications.

At one point I was showing him a few things related to local security policy and I opened up the local users and groups mmc.  He says ""Is that the registry?""   \*facepalm\*

So...we just went through a PC migration.  A little over 100 computers were replaced with newer models and the old ones are in the process of being decommissioned.  Part of that process is removing, documenting, and destroying the hard drives of the old computers.  The hard drives had been pulled and were awaiting documentation and destruction (something we do on-site).

Today, I find a random hard drive in a drawer and ask my team lead about it.

TL: Yea, I dunno.  Hook it up to a non-network computer and see what's on it.  Maybe we can reuse it.  And while you're at it, check those other two drives in the other drawer!

Me:  What drives?

Intern:  Oh?  I moved those.

Me:  To where?

Intern:  In the back with the rest of them.  I trashed them all yesterday!  \*looking very pleased with himself\*

Suddenly, I feel much sympathy for the poor souls at SolarWinds...",46,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D09BE8E0>
974,User Self-Sabotages Webinar Recording,"My job is to provide tech support  for classroom technology and video conferencing at a major university. Zoom's most commonly used by our my school for online conferences. We have our users Zoom cloud recordings auto-upload to Kaltura. Kaltura is a education focused video platform, like a closed off YouTube for your own school. This user had just hosted a webinar and called into our helpline.

>​User: ""Hello, I've just hosted a webinar all day and I am unable to find the recording. I am positive I made one.""

>Me: ""Hello, I can definitely check that for you. One moment.""

>User: ""Great. I really need this recording. It's super important.""

\* I can see on the Zoom admin dashboard the meeting WAS recorded. I also have Kaltura admin privileges, so I log into there. I do not see the recording in the account. No worries, might have been recorded to the local machine.\*

>Me: ""Alright, I agree that you hit the record button in that meeting. Do you recall whether you made a cloud or local recording?""   
>  
>User: ""I don't remember. I know I set it to auto-record so I wouldn't have to actually start the recording myself.""

\*Great! This is actually good news. If they scheduled the webinar to auto-record I can see in the meeting settings whether it was set to record to the cloud or the local device\*

*Completely unsolicited the user divulges this bit of information*

>User: ""I really hope you find this. My job might be on the line here. This conference had a very notable keynote speaker. Part of their payment includes a copy of this recording.""

\*She told me who the guest was. They're a B-Tier celeb, they've made their rounds in the mainstream news. I imagine they were not cheap to book for an event, even an online one. I'm now slightly worried this user might have fenagled the recording, but I want to remain optimistic\*

>Me:  ""I can see it was recorded, you remember setting it to auto-record, it's likely just on the machine you hosted from. We'll confirm that in just a moment.""

\*I pull up the meeting details for the webinar she hosted. It is set to record to the cloud, *not* the local machine. Something is definitely wrong here.\*

>User: ""Yes. I do see an entry that is the same name as the webinar but there is no video, just audio only.""

\*When she said that, I knew that recording was not going to be found.\*

\*In Zoom's support admin role, I can't see the recordings stored on their account but I can see their recording settings. I open up her recording settings and I find the source of the problem.\*

\*Under the cloud recording settings, the user can select how they want the recording layout to look (record gallery view with screen share, record active speaker with  screen share, record these separate). This user had gone into her own settings and ***un-checked*** all the boxes. Since no layout was chosen for cloud recordings, when the recording started, no video was actually captured.\*

\*She did have the option to record a separate audio file still checked, so that was all she had from that day long event.\*

975,Outdated Software Support,"Short story time!

About 2 years ago, I was working with a customer who was having some issues with our software.

As a developer, I am only called in when things are beyond normal support.

The software was failing to replicate data from the live server to the standby server.  During the initial discussions, it was determined that systems were rather out of date.
I wish I could just tell them we don't support old versions, but that's just a pipe dream, I suppose.

As we are talking about how the datastore gets replicated from one machine to the other during startup, I mention that the datastore files are copied using SCP with a superuser account using a private key.

The customer's sysadmin gets a little upset, and says ""You should NOT be using root to scp files around the network!"", 
to which I had probably the greatest support answer I have ever delivered in my life: ""Oh, no, we haven't done it that way for at least 8 years now!"".

This triggered some heated discussion on their part about keeping software up to date, with me still on the line. It was glorious!",52,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D09BE9A0>
976,Security Officer Breaks Security,"I worked as the tech lead in a small account of a huge corporation and I typically handled the tech support problems within our system because I was in the office and most of the other developers were off site, plus I knew everything about our system. 

One day I received a tech support call from the top manager about how our account did not have documentation of items promoted to production since the first quarter. This isn’t something I normally did, as it was in the System Administrator (SA) area, but I knew the scripts, had read only access to them, and knew how unsupported we were in that department this year (we went from a specific SA who knew our system to a revolving group team that didn’t know our system). We were starting our yearly audit with an external firm on our security procedures and all sorts of other business things. Without this audit trail, we were in deep trouble and could face some big fines. 

A little history is needed. We had finally picked up our own account security officer (aso) in charge of the standard corporate security requirements for our industry. Beforehand our small account had piggy backed off another account. This was a finding of the previous year’s audit that we didn’t have a dedicated aso. This new aso took great exception that with our very small team that I not only wrote and reviewed code, but also promoted code through the various environments. The aso thought that I was a security risk and came up with all sorts of scenarios in which I could go bad and corrupt or destroy the system in some way. It didn’t matter that a DBA or a SA had far more access and capability of destroying more than just the system, but the backup systems, logs etc. I was the one who was the danger. 

I gave the aso our written documentation on the promoting procedures and walked them through the steps and situations that had to be avoided. All this was documented. Their major concern was that I could promote my own code to production. Whenever I (or my backup) promoted anything, it was logged in our version control system who promoted what (file and version) and when. At the end of the day, an email went out with the information on what was promoted to where that day to our aso. If for some reason I had to promote my own code, I had manager approval in email that the aso was included in. I countered all their arguments and wrote the whole thing up for my top manager, including my findings that we did not have strong controls over SAs, DBAs, and most specifically, Managers who used their authority to bypass procedures. 

We had system logs showing who did what/when and those logs and backup systems were all outside our ability to manipulate etc. It was a secured system from our side of things. 

Thus, why I was surprised I had a call regarding how our account did not have documentation of items promoted to production since the first quarter. I dug in and discovered the following. 

The aso decided they still didn’t trust me. They wanted to change the end of day (EOD) script that sent email on who promoted what to include additional information that our current script didn’t have. Our revolving group team of SAs couldn’t change the script to his desires, so he found another account in our company who used a similar system and had them send their EOD script, convinced the SA of the day to replace the script without testing because it works fine in the other account, and the next day the aso went on vacation. When the aso came back, they never noticed they weren’t receiving this EOD promotion email anymore. This went on for half a year. 

I wrote a special script that crawled through our version control and for every file promoted to prod since the last audit, it showed who promoted version(s) from development up through the testing stages, including the noted details on the promotions. The report also highlighted instances of someone reporting their own code, which the noted details explained. It was easy to support that last requirement with the approval emails for those very few occasions that happened. This took care of the problem of no EOD promotion emails and became a supplemental part of our security findings each audit. 

I then happily had a meeting with the aso and top manager and explained how the aso broke protocols without any approvals, which specific items in the promotion procedure documentation that were broken, and how they bad it was and reiterated how we did not have controls in place to stop an aso or manager from going rogue or using their authority to bypass our controls. It was a good day.",14,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D09BEA00>
977,I should have followed my instincts...,"I was assigned a ticket to install a server roof fan at a client site. It was my first time ever doing such a ticket. But no problem, I'm a capable technician that can follow instructions and look at something and determine what goes where. I get onsite, talk to the client, get the new server roof fan out the box, take off the old server roof and replace it with the new server fan. I installed the roof fan PRECISELY how it was in the diagram along with instructions. I installed it in where it fit perfectly. Now I'm not too familiar with server room fans and which way the air is supposed to blow. But after installation, the server fan was blowing out of the server, not into the server. I tell the client I'm finished but he wants to check out my work. He looks at it and says ""Hey, the air should be blowing into the server, not out of the server."" I say to the client ""I'm not so sure sir, I followed the instructions as shown here."" He is adamant that I installed it wrong, and another user walks into the room and says that I installed it wrong too. Client tells me ""Fix it right!"".....Fine...so I switched the fan around so now air is blowing INTO the server. Now he is satisfied, but then says ""Its way too loud, does it have to be this loud? Cant you turn it down?"" ""No sir, I cant. That's natural for the fan to be this loud."" He says that its unacceptable because someone will be working in the same room as the server....SO...he puts a box on top of the server to lessen the noise. ""Sir you are now blocking airflow, I would not recommend putting a box on top to lessen the noise"" ""It's fine!"" He exclaims. ""Call your manager and see if its ok to put this box on top"" Sir, I wont call because he is going to say the same exact thing I'm saying now"" (I'm definitely not calling my busy ass manager to ask if a client can put a box on top of a server fan

\-\_\_\_\_\_\_- ) So after all this I left and spoke with a senior tech about my experience. Senior tech tells me that I DID INSTALL the server fan the CORRECT way the first time around. And that air should be blowing out of the server because of ABC XYZ...Should have followed my instincts....",122,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D09BEA60>
978,"My mouse is ""broken""","Hello fellow techs, I work with and support an entitled User (we all know the type) who also happens to be as dense as a black hole (if she wasn't so problematic I wouldn't care). I have multiple stories about how I came to realize that she is, in fact, an idiot, but none of them felt worthy of posting but I might get around to it at some point. In general, it can be summed up with, her stupidity often forced me to do extra work that was wholly unnecessary so I resented her for obvious reasons.

I am setting up **EntitledUser** to work with our new bank platform, when I see her send a ticket in about how she ""*needs*"" a new wireless mouse. We send them out with all laptops for people who need to work remote to make things easier, as a kind of perk. So every single laptop we setup gets one, so naturally we're almost always out of them. We're constantly struggling to keep them in stock.

So I ask my **FriendUser** what the issue is, since she's in the same room assisting her. Let me be clear, I asked **FriendUser** first because I had a hunch that **EntitledUser** was going to lie directly to my face, and what do you know?

I hate being right all the time.

She asks the **EntitledUser**, who doesn't know that we're friends, what the issue is, and the info is then relayed to me that **EntitledUser** has decided she doesn't want to have to pick up her wireless mouse and put it in her laptop bag with her laptop to take home. She want a wireless mouse for her desk, *and* one for her bag.

I tell **FriendUser**, nicely, that the whole reason she has a wireless mouse and not a wired one, is so that it's easy to travel with. We *do* have a wireless mouse in stock, but sending one out just for her to have an extra defeats the entire point of her having the wireless to begin with. **FriendUser** bows out of being the middleman at this point, saying she agrees with my point but does *not* want to relay anymore information for me. So I thank her for giving me the honest truth and move directly to contact with **EntitledUser**.

Me, being the nice patient guy I am, rather than just saying, ""No your request is wholly unreasonable."", I decide to give her the chance to come clean, then offer her a solution.

""Good morning, **EntitledUser**, what is the issue with your current mouse?""

""It's broken, in like multiple pieces broken."" *Liar Liar pants on fire*

""Oh that's terrible! How/when did that happen? Have you been able to work at all?""

""It just happened this morning, I dropped it. I can't work and I need a new one.""

At this point, I'm done with the song and dance and clue her in that I know it's not actually broken cause I'm actively remoted into her PC, and can see her moving the mouse around. I am in *take no shit* mode cause I am underpaid and overworked and already don't like her.

""I can see your mouse moving around on your screen so it looks like it's working alright for now. **FriendUser** has let me know the situation with your mouse. So the wireless mice are provided with the laptops so that if the dongle is plugged directly into the laptop, it will be easy to move and travel with, if you'd like one for permanent placement in your laptop bag, I can send you an extra wired mouse for the docking station however we don't keep stock on hand to provide multiple wireless mice per laptop.""

I felt like that was reasonable work-around. She gets an extra wired mouse, we have a million of them, and then she can keep the wireless on in her bag. Instead, she doesn't respond to the email and ignores it entirely.

I wish there was a happy ending to this story, but I found out from **FriendUser** later that she was just going to buy another wireless mouse and expense it to the bank. Which will probably get approved. There are just some special Users that make me drink heavily.

**Edit**: So it got pointed out that without context it sounds like I just threw **FriendUser** under the bus, so I'll copy  a comment up here for a bit more clarification cause I did cut out a part of the story cause it was feeling long.

""I was in **EntitledUser's** PC and working on things, and had to call **FriendUser's** cell to work on other stuff at the same time for **EntitledUser**, who then repeated that she needed a new mouse and told **FriendUser** to tell me that. **FriendUser** repeated that to me, and said, ""it seemed to be working okay for right now, and that she wanted one for her laptop bag I believe"".

So **FriendUser** did get involved again and **EntitledUser** knew we were talking about it, but that all felt unimportant to the gist of the story to talk about all the back and forth on that phone call.""",92,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D09BEAC0>
979,End user connects a desktop to a docking station,"A bit of backstory: we have almost exclusively laptops with docking stations in our environment, with a few desktops for specific use cases. Additionally, I work on an escalation team for hardware and OS-related issues.

This issue is a story of miscommunication, the gross misuse of terminology by the end user, and a bit of lying. Good grief, this one is a little infuriating, looking back on it.

Here’s how it goes: I get a cold transfer from our tier 1 support for an issue with the end user’s monitors not working on their docking station. The ticket is pretty typical for a tier 1 escalation—not much relevant information or anything else, for that matter. The end user is frustrated and clearly not very familiar with technology, and is one of the people that refers to a monitor as a desktop, modem, router, docking station, etc. When there is no clear definition of what is what, everything breaks down from there.

The end user says they have a desktop computer which they NEVER use and it isn’t connected to anything. They use their laptop and connect it to the docking station and that always worked—cool. After remotely accessing the device, I see it’s one of our desktop models, so I inquire a bit more about it. She is ADAMANT it’s the laptop, but msinfo32 doesn’t lie… in that event, I assumed she had plugged the display into her desktop computer and that was that. 

After some 1.5 hours of further investigation, here’s what I found:
- The end user had both a desktop and a laptop w/ docking station
- The monitor was never actually connected to the docking station and never had worked
- The end user was connecting a USB-A male to USB-C male from the desktop into the Thunderbolt 3 port on the laptop because she thought that was the docking station
- She had the docking station plugged into power and then into her laptop

Of course, this whole process of trying to determine what was wrong was exacerbated by them calling the desktop computer and docking station every possible piece of networking equipment you could ever think of. At the end of the call, we eventually were able to test the dock properly and turns out it was thrown into a closet because it was broken and they just drug it back out. After 2 hours of troubleshooting, I told her I had requested a replacement from the vendor, to which she asked why, as she never actually used the laptop.",59,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D09BEB20>
980,Turn it on and leave it On,"This is another printer sharer saga from the dark ages. Way back when, the New Zealand Government, created the new Ministry of Women's Affairs (MWA) or something like that, However funding was fairly limited. I got a call to an Office where a lady was having problems printing, Actually several ladies were. A quick look around reveals 3 or 4 already outdated IBM PC XT machines connected via a serial print sharer to a HP Deskjet Printer, The printer is Offline with a Baud rate error. So I clear that and press Online. Ok I ask the user to print something. She says the PC is turned off and therefore she cant  print just now, she then turns it on.

The print sharer is scanning around the input ports and this can be seen on the LEDS showing the Port it is checking. The thing works by outputting the DTR (ready) signal to each PC in turn. If a PC has a print job pending, it receives this DTR signal and outputs data, the sharer sees this and latches onto the port so the job can be completed, then eventually times out and scans again. Simple. 

In this case the PC being turned on would create some undefined output state while it powers up and this is seen by the printer sometimes when that port is selected. The printer sees a glitch on the RX line and since it doesn't  match the config for data bytes, 9600,8,N or whatever, it immediately goes offline with a Baud rate error. And stays Offline.

The reason the PC's are turned Off, these ladies are doing ""Research"" by reading articles (Mills and Boon PROBABLY)  And the fans on these already redundant XT computers are too noisy. There's literally nothing I can do except advise them turn on the computer, press online on the printer and hope someone else doesn't turn on another one before they print.",4,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D09BEB80>
981,Where's Earth?,"**Back in the dark ages** before Ethernet, I mean before coaxial cable 10 Mbps Ethernet was common, I was working as a Computer Cable installer, and trouble shooter. We did a lot of RS232 Serial printer connections and when several users needed the same printer, we would install a printer sharing box. (Printers were really expensive back then, so were the computers). The country is New Zealand.

I get called by one of our other installers to help him figure out a problem. I go on site which was an embassy from a European country.  He shows me the printer, the print sharer which already has some other PCs which are printing just fine. He has installed a new cable to an office for a new user and asks me to look at his wiring. I agree its fine, he's done it correctly, but in the process I felt a small electric shock. I tried to test it but it turned out my meter had a broken lead, It was good last time I used it so this was just bad luck it broke now. I could not not repeat the electric shock so began to wonder if I had imagined it. We go back to the PC and send some random text like a Dir list redirected to com1: Nothing. The PC has a second serial port, connect the cable there and Dir>Com2: Bingo, it works, Ok set up the PC to redirect LPT1: to Com2: in Autoexec.bat and run it. Print again, Nothing. Try everything that worked before, Nothing.

Inform the staff that it must be some PC problem and we can't do anything more. Later I meet up with a Tech from the computer supplier and they change the Motherboard. It works, Print ok. Then NOT, Again! Try the second port, same thing, print once then nothing, Again. The computer tech and I start looking for clues as I tell him about the small shock I felt right at the beginning, suddenly I see it. The user came from Europe and brought the PC with him and his power cord and a travel adaptor with NO EARTH connector. Now I understand, the PC power Supply has capacitors from Phase to ground and Neutral to ground as part of the noise filter. And this acts as a capacitive divider which puts about 100volts AC in the PC case if not grounded. This is also signal ground from the the serial ports which our cable connected to the print sharer and therefore to signal ground of the printer and the other PCs connected there. The Comm ports (4 of them in the end, 2 ports each on 2 motherboards) on the New computer had all died after a short time due to the AC voltage. A new power cable was provided when the 2nd new motherboard was installed. Problem solved",28,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D09BEBE0>
982,I forgot to ask simple thing and got extended vacation and numb behind.,"One adventure of IT-guy before sweet sleep. 

There are one thing at my work that some times just suck. That is being a call even when I am on my vacation. Good thing is that when I am on vacation and I get that call to go to office and push some buttons, I get nice 3 hours of extended vacation for every hour I have to work. Plus travel expenses. Of course if Im out of country on my vacation, then I don't have to go. And the work time starts when I start traveling to the office.

Some years ago, I was on my summer vacation with my girldfriend of that time. We went to her dads summer cabin that is roughly 450km from our home. There were me, my GF, her father and step mother. My GF's sister and her boyfriend Andy

It was a morning, don't remember what day of the week it was but it was morning. I had just woken up and was ready to fill my self with coffee when my cellphone informed that it need my attention. 

I check the phone and see that the number is from work. Ok, there we go again. 

I answer and one of our project workers is in panic mode. 

Let's call her 'Jane"". Jane is some sort of a manager or rather a coordinator. She also has a collegue there that we can call ""Jill""

Jane explains that there is something wrong with their desktop printer. It does not print anything.  
This project does work with rehabilitation clients and is pretty much separated from our network. They got one small office with laptop and desktop printer. They don't have access to our AD and got their own instead. Some of the projects share their own AD and fileserver on different network than rest of us.  
They don't have same printing and copying solution as rest ot the organisation. So Janes project depends completely on that desktop printer. It's really a matter of funding. I got permit to buy them cheap laptop and cheap desktop printer and the money issued was an insult.   
It's goverment issued and they got their on jam.  
So that printer doesn't have LAN. It's usb only. And that should not be a problem as Jane and her collegue are only ones using the laptop and the printer.

Jane states that important client related documents has to be delivered to certain GOV institution next day and the printer is all bitchy.

So we start the remote repairs using our big brains and 

Me: "" So have you tried to turn the printer off and on again?""  
Jane: ""Yes, few times. does not help.""  
Me: "" And the laptop?""  
Jane: ""Yeah we tried to restart that too. Same thing. We try to print and nothing happens""  
Me:"" Mildy interesting...""  
Jane:"" The printer icon in control panel is grey like it's not on but the printer is on""  
Me: "" Ok now it is interesting""

Me: "" And check that the printer is connected to laptop also.""   
It's a usb printer and maybe they just forgot to plug it back if they used the lap top out of office. 

Jane:  ""Of course the printer is connected. I connected it my self! I have tried to disconnect it and reconnect it too.""   

Me: "" OK ok. "" Jane sounded like she is about to turn into dark side.  
Me:"" Maybe the cable is faulty. There are some spare cables at my office aaaaand forget. You dont have keys to my office. You don't have any spare usb printer cables there do you?""  
Jane:"" Haha no. You are the cable guy""  


Me: "" As I can't really help you from here is it possible that you loan some ones workstation and print it from there? Take the document on usb drive? Ill be back from cabin in a week.""

Jane: "" Not possible. There is no one here, every one is on vacation. ( It was July. In July whole organisation is pretty much closed for whole month. Only ones working are some project workers and they only go to office when they need to. July is remote work from home usually.)

Me: "" OK Ill start to make some calls. Maybe I can get some one there. Ill call you soon back""

I end the call with Jane and start calling co-workers. Well turns out that I can't get anyone to go to the office and help those poor project peeps out from their despair. I called and messaged everyone I could think off, even the director and nope. I think some of those people could go to the office but they simply do not want. And they don't have to if they don't want to.   
And I am not going to call every single employee anyway. 

So I call back to Jane.

Me:"" Well look like we are in sticky situation. Can't get anyone there.""  
Jane: "" Well how long it would take for you to drive here and fix this""   
Me: "" Umm it's 6 hours drive at least""  
Jane:"" Ok then. Start driving""  
Me:"" You sure? Your gonna need to stay there untill I arrive.""  
Jane: "" It's ok. As long you come""  
Me:""Ok. Ill get ready, you send me the formal request for onsite support via email so director and HR wont chew my ass of after my vacation""  
Jane:"" Will do, hurry up. We will wait here""

I start to put some better clothes on. 

When Im on vacation and get call to go to the office, who ever asks me to come has to send me a formal request so there is a proof that issue was not solved on a phone or remote session and I have to go to the site. And I did not have my laptop with me so I could not do much remotely anyway.

While I try to find some clothes to put on I get the email. I finish my coffee, call the director and explain the situation just in case and tell him that I have to go to the office on that project is in trouble. He says sure, go and do what needs to be done.   
Girlfriend I tell that I am sorry, gotta go, salt mine is calling.

So I drive next 6 hours back to home, get the office keys and my id card. Then drive to office. The long drive was boring and I could not feel my butt after 3 hours. It has ceased to exist. 

I arrive to the site to see my mechanical patient. I still can't feel my butt. It might died.

Me"" Hey Jane, I am here. lets dig into your problem"" 

Now poor Jane and her collegue have been there all day waiting for me.  
It's way past office hours but as it's summer and vacation season no one cares..

Jane:"" Finaly. I so hope you can fix this as we are royally fcuked if we don't deliver those papers tomorrow."" 

Me:"" No worries. If this is not fixed in 15minutes, Ill let you use my workstation and print the damn thing""

I think that fast and easy fix is to just reinstall the printer drivers.

I uninstall the printer drivers. Then I reach the usb printer cable... I know fore sure that this lap top has only 3 usb ports. One has mouse, one has usb thumb drive and one has external usb drive. Wait a second???! Brain starts to do M-A-T-H

I just jump from up from the seat and yell some profanity words.

I look at Jane and say

Me"" So you connected the printer usb cable all by your self riiiiight""

Jane:"" Yes. why?""

Me: "" Well you plugged the damn printer usb cable to the ETHERNET port, AGAIN! ""

And then I was pretty much pissed to myself as I forgot to ask her about it as this is not the first time some one does this, or her. It's a thing here. They frigging plug anything to anything as long it fits.  
I honestly thought they had already had gotten past of this idiocracy.  

Jane looks pretty horrified, mostly because she is having ""im an idiot"" moment. Jill not so amused. And Jill doesn't speak. Like ever. I have never heard her say a word. Creepy.

Me:"" Yeah. I should have asked you about this, this happens alot here. Happend to you too few months ago when you were having that presentation and your usb stick was ""broken"" remember!!!""

Jane gets a little bit color on her cheeks, the blush.

Jane:"" Yeah. I im little embarrassed now to be honest. I am so sorry you had to drive all that way here for this""

Me: "" Well I still have to drive back you know ""

Jane: "" Oh shoot. Yeah. Well thanks anyway. Ill be more observing next time about what I plug and where. Can you keep this between us?""

Me: "" Absolutely not. I have to write a report as I am on my vacation and you called me onsite. Report is needed so I can get the extended hours from this and travel expenses. So unfortunately director will see the report.""   


I install the drivers and the printer. I plug the cable where it belongs and printer prints just fine.   
I booked 7 hours of work and 460km of traveling. I got \~0.30 cents per Km. I got about 3 days extended vacation.   
Going back to the cabing was on my own expense and on my own time thou. 

Did not drive back that day. Went home and had some pizza and beer. I started feel my butt.  
I drove back to cabin next morning and my butt went all numb again.  
Jane got some serious verbal crackdown from director later but she took it all in and never discussed the matter much. She still reminds me some times how she has not plugged that many usb devices to her ethernet lately, just few.  
My girlfriend was pissed, her sister was pissed, her step mother was pissed, her father barely noticed my absence and Andy gave me a beer as soon I arrived to the cabin. I forgot the small and nasty interuption to my nice vacation after 8 beers.   
Butt recovered the feel too eventually.",189,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D09BEC40>
983,How do I capitalize without Capslock?,"Short story from when I got my first help desk job. We only worked with internal employees and the lines were recorded so generally everyone was nice because they did not want to get in trouble with HR for berating IT.

User calls in

User: ""I can't get into (program name) my password does not work

Me: Standard corporate greetings and verification process

User passes and I unlock account and walk user through password reset process 

User: It still doesn't work

I am pretty confused as i'm still getting up to date on all the systems and I need to confirm he's talking about the right program. Users have two different sets of credentials for two different sets of programs, one of which is a mainframe system which uses both but for different parts of the mainframe.

About 40 minutes pass of me walking him through the mainframe and resetting both accounts. At this point i'm done and I am CONFIDENT i'm resting the right account for the program user does. At this point i've also issued the user a temporary password that will expire on use and the user still says it doesn't work. This is the third temp issue so I ask user to read out each key as he presses it on the keyboard. I've also from the beginning reminded user to NOT USE CAPSLOCK but had to give him a password that started with capitals.

User: Capslock P.......

Me: Stop, did you just say you hit Capslock.

User: Yes you told me it starts with a capital P

Me: *Trying not to send death threats* I want you to type a sentence in the address bar it can be anything.

I hear user type for a few seconds and then complain it's all in caps.

Me: Now hit capslock one and type the sentence over again, but instead on the first letter hold shift at the same time.

User then informed me it's no longer using all caps and seemed confused.

Once we got that cleared up it was like any other call except I felt defeated, the user felt dumb and my company paid me the same. I learned when giving temporary passwords since I had to audibly give it to them it's fine and even good practice to have them read each key they type if they seem to have issues with the temp password.

I know it's not the most interesting story but i'm sure we all have been there

TL:DR User wasted 40 minutes ignoring my requests to not use Capslock on a password without all caps because they did not know it locked all your key inputs to result in capital letters.",88,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D09BECA0>
984,"I am writing a LETTER, do you understand!","Before I update my previous post that I made way too tired and too drunk. Im gonna share something that happend just resently, before my summer brake. 

You all know about different paper sizes at the office. You got your A4, A3, A5 etc. Also, some countries apparenly use size that is called 'Letter'.

Ok. We have a printing/copier system leased from major brand and it's pretty much perfect setup. Users can print to 'Secure printer' and then use their keycard to pull out the print from any of machine that has card reader. Only problem with whole system has a bug that no one has yet to managed to fix. Some times, systems default the paper size from A4 to Letter.

We only use A5, A4 and A3 at our Org. And Im not even sure if I could get size 'Letter' from anywhere as it is really not a thing in my country.

So thats is background info.

The incident

I get call some time at the afternoon from one of the teachers from our immigrant language program. She is super nice person. Always joyfull and even when she has a problem with tech and I can't ansver her call she does not flip. All chill and smiles. Also note that she is native english talker and is fluent in many languages my native language as well but we usually talk in english. 

She calls and tells me that she has big printing problem. I say ""ok, ill be there in a minute""

I head up and to teachers office. She tells me that she can't get the print out no matter how hard she tries. Printer just keeps telling that paper size is invalid. She also tells me that she is writing an important letter and she needs to print it, sign it and send it vie snailmail today.

I tell her to print it again and then we head to closest MFP and check what is the issue.

I turn my back and head to the MFP what is just around the corner. She proceeds printing.

She soon comes to MFP and I tell her to login to the machine. She swipes her card and Ill press the secure print and see that she has couple of pending prints there from same document. All are waiting for supplies. Ill put one of them to print and yes, get error that paper size is invalid. Machine want's 'Letter"". 

I look at her and we start talking.

Me: Yeah, print job is trying to print to letter, you need to choose A4 from your computer""

She: "" Im writing letter""

Me: ""Umm yes but you need to print it to A4""

She: "" No I am writing and printing a letter. A letter""

Me: "" Yeah but you need to print it to A4""

She looking be with confused eyes: "" A letter. I m trying to print my letter""

I could feel it. The anoying feeling when you get that thing behind your eye that makes your eye twitch uncontrollably. 

I look at her and say as calm as I can...

Me: "" I know that you need to print your ""letter"" but you need to print it to A4 because we do not have the size 'letter' here. You computer sometimes bug and defaults the papersize to 'letter"" so you need to make sure A4 is selected of you can't print. 

She looks me into eyes. I look her into eyes. We have moment here. Then she facepalms her self with both hands and mutters: 

""Oh god im so stupid""

I snort a bit and tell her that you are not the first one to have this a letter problem. ( she was but I wanted to make her feel better )

She just laughs and asks me if I could keep this a secret. ""Plz don't tell anyone ok""

""I promise. I will never talk about his ever again""",182,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D09BED00>
985,Case fans,"Getting ready to clean my tower today reminded me of a funny story;

So my Wife has been having issues with her self-built gaming tower overheating. She did a light clean, and that helped for a few weeks. She tried putting it up on casters to improve air access at the empty bottom fan port, no change.

She did some research on fan configuration, and figured out the fans were setup wrong (only one facing out, and trying to push out the bottom front no less). So, armed with this knowledge she decided she would add a bottom fan, Do a deep clean, and re-orient the fans.

This resulted in 7 fans, maxing out her motherboards 5 fan plugs, and 2 add-on fan plugs. Moment of truth, she turns it on. And.... One of the fans is barely running. Drat, it must have bad bearings and flipping it over was the last straw, right? So we file replacing it under future purchases, and she loads up a game.

As the game loads, the fan speeds up a bit, after a half hour it's spinning at full speed. Strange. So when she finishes her game off, and the fan starts slowing down again.

And it was at this moment my Wife realized she had plugged this case fan in as CPU-OPT, and the motherboard only spun it up when necessary... Oops...",14,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D09BED60>
986,When you ask for a color but can’t trust the answer,"

Last week someone called me from his homeoffice to tell me that he has no connection, so I asked him what was the color of the little circle on the top left screen 

(we use a hypervisor for our mobile clients that encrypts traffic (vpn) and the virtual disk of the vm and when in the vm, there is a colored circle at the top left that gives you information about the vpn connection) 

He told me it was green, what usually means that he is connected to the office. I searched a whole 10 minutes for the error before I told him I need to further investigate the problem with other colleges and asked him one last time to click on the colored circle and read the ip’s of the connections that it will show. He then said there are none….

I said: „but you told me the color is green“ 
He said: „ok, I have to tell you something… I’m colorblind“ 
I said: „that’s ok but it would have been better if you told me this, cause then I would have checked your connection in another way.“
He said: „but I was really sure ist is green“

987,"Turkey Logic - Protects data; Nay, Prevents work and money"," I can’t excuse that I am a non-English speaker or that I am on mobile, since neither applies. I do not grant permission for others to copy my story or to present it whole or in part in any other website other than the one that I wrote it in (namely reddit) including YouTube. And my employer has remained nameless to protect either the innocent or the guilty, depending on your interpretation.

So freshly out of my first project’s deployment, I was placed into the maintenance group that handles that project’s ongoing support, plus two other associated systems.

This group handles the data for all the deposits that are made by the various buildings making deposits to the bank. These are large volume, large amount deposits, with about $2,000,000 minimum per day spread over 75 different locations. There is a mandate that a payment coming in must be delivered to the bank as a deposit within one business day or… HWR (Heads Will Roll) figuratively in one sense, but with the ultimate fear that the press would get wind of the problem and ask sticky questions.

So, perhaps not job loss, but the embarrassment of having someone stick a microphone and a monster of a camera in your face engenders a significant unwillingness to take risks unnecessarily.

After a few months of the routine, it happened that, for some reason, a batch of deposits got messed up within the system. No problem, delete the offending batch and enter it again. There was an option in the supervisor’s menu to precisely do that. The catch, the code required that we in IT must code the batch number within the program that would run if that option was chosen and for only that one exclusive batch.

But this was holding up the entire country’s deposits. Remember $2,000,000 or more? And the ever feared TV cameras pointed your way.

(Technical comment – This was CICS (IBM Customer Information Control Sytem) and you didn’t just bump the program out. You coded the program, compiled it, placed in the test environment, tested it, then uploaded the code into production, compiled, begged management to sign off to petition the system administrators to force a CICS environment refresh within production, then called the manager in the remote office to delete the batch. At which point, life was good. Of course, this was an emergency patch. No test environment… place it into production without any ability to test it.)

Life was not good. Angels cried. The batch did not delete. Remote manager notified head office.

It was at that point that I was reminded that my previous boss, who wrote the logic of this particular piece of software was known for being extremely fond of “Turkey Logic”. Where, even if you know that the only way to get to a particular part of code is that the condition must be met, he would write the same conditional check a second time!

In this process, I also came to realize that he was not fond of commenting his bloody code. Because there was no mention that this check would occur twice. And in another program that was called by the menu system after the first program finished! Not sequential, but concurrent with a slight delay to be effectively and offensively the same thing.

So, back again into the code, modify the second conditional check, beg the manager, petition the holy system administrators, call the manager in the remote office to delete the batch, and…

The batch still did not delete!

And I found out that, having passed through one fire, the batch was left in a half-way dead state where it would not pass the first check but would pass the second check. 

Into code, modify everything to bypass the first check, grovel to the manager who was getting annoyed, petition the holy system administrators (and I wasn’t even allowed to effect food or liquid bribery, though I did promise to a beer to the gatekeeper after work,) called the manager, and the batch finally deleted.

All 75 Brinks Trucks loaded up and headed over to the bank for deposit in time that day, though it was a close one.

And I took the System Administrator Gatekeeper to the pub down the hill for his beer after work. (Did not have a clue as to why the bar tender knew him by first name. I was young and innocent then.)

The next routine iteration of the program updates (that weekend) included a series of comments within the management Delete Batch pointing out that the Batch ID must be programmed in two separate places and also encoding the batch number as a constant within both programs making it way easier to locate and change. I may have had a trial by fire but there was no way that I would let someone else go through that same hell.

I grew to hate “Turkey Logic” in code whenever I spotted it. When located, I would comment the hell out of it so that subsequent people reading would realize that the logic is placed in two spots and the code must be kept in sync. Wherever possible, would use constants to make the logic clearly stand out.

**TLDR:**

* A prior developer set up a logic test within two separate programs which had to be coded the same way for a mission critical action to be performed.
* Said mission critical action would occur about once every two years, had to be approved by IT, and executed by local management.
* Failure to complete the mission critical action would result in about $2,000,000 not getting deposited to the bank account that day.",20,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D09BEE20>
988,"Cost for the day was $500,000+","I worked for a company that runs the public transport payment system. Weekly we would be supplied with updates to the stops and routes the operators used for the busses. Over time the number of stale stops and routes would build up. While I was in the position of doing that I developed a database script that identified the unused information and deactivated them. I ran this script every week, the bus drivers loved it because they only had the information they needed. There are many stop points that are critical to the system and my script excluded them from being deactivated.

I moved to the engineering section after the other employee returned from maternity leave. She was less technically inclined so the script was not run. Eventually the size of the information being sent out was exceeding the limit the devices could cope with. Despite me running every week for almost 12 months the cleanup under her went through the whole change request process, whatever. Another 2 years pass and she leaves, the replacement was much more competent and would submit a change request on a regular basis instead of waiting until it was past the limits.

So the six monthly deactivation rolls around once again I respond to the usual questions thinking what the hell is the problem running a script I ran every week. Monday morning after the deactivation I get a call at 6 letting me know that no passengers can tag on. I jump on the VPN and check, patrons can tag on the train but not the busses. As part of the script I recorded every action taken. I check the stops that have been deactivated, not one of them is in a route. I jump on a bus and tag to see the actual error is for my self, I ask the bus driver what he has been seeing, none of it makes sense.

We upload the weeks files again, if a stop is in the file the system reactivates it, does not help. I use a tool I developed that pretends to be a device and download from the system all the files that the device would, all looks good. We ran the same script in our test system, the busses work just fine. Since this P1 has been going on for hours the CEO and the minister are speaking on a regular basis.

Eventually we get the developers on the other side of the country that do the device software involved. I send them the files I had already downloaded, it immediately fails. They dig into the log files and find that a stop point that is hard coded in the device is deactivated. We activate the stop and all busses now work. However most drivers are unaware and still tell people the system is not working and to just get on.

The reason it did not go pear shaped years earlier is that hard coded stop point was used in a route. How or why that stop was the hard coded one or why the stop was no longer in an active route is unknown. All up the loss of revenue I heard was at least over half a million dollars, and probably closer to 600k. We didn't have to bear the entire cost of the outage, no idea what it cost the company.

If you are a developer DO NOT HARD CODE VALUES IN THE CODE!!!!!! At most put the value in the INI file so others can at least see what it is.",37,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D09BEE80>
989,Let's deploy an infinite loop to production on a Friday afternoon. What could possibly go wrong?,"Background: I'm on the helpdesk for an international company. Our company has an in-house ticketing system developed and managed by an internal team that happens to sit right next to us. It's great because we can ask for features and they'll actually be implemented in a reasonable time-frame. We get to skip all the paperwork and hoops to jump through that the rest of our company is so in love with.

The unofficial process is that we complain to them about something and a few days/weeks later we'll log on and suddenly find that they fixed it. Fantastic process... Usually.

&#x200B;

A while back, someone from my team complained that users were replying to the emails that get sent when we close a ticket. The system would attach their email as a note to the closed ticket, and users were getting the expectation that their note on a closed ticket would be seen by someone...

They were sorely mistaken, but that's not really relevant.

We were getting tired of calls about new issues written on random 3 month old and closed tickets, and how they're not being resolved, so someone brought it up to the ticketing system team and they grumbled agreement and we stopped worrying about it...

Until we closed up shop on Friday afternoon, came in on Saturday morning for our normally pretty dead weekend shift, and took a few calls before we got the first person with an out of office message...

&#x200B;

That's when we learned that late on friday afternoon, a small change was pushed to the ticket system.  If an email is sent for a closed ticket, the system automatically replies with a message saying the ticket is closed and asking for them to open a new ticket with nice instructions and pretty pictures...

Out of Office messages were NOT accounted for. Not only that, they decided to be helpful and also send US an email when a user tried to reply to a closed ticket...

&#x200B;

I'm sure at least a few of you are yelling at your monitors already, but for the rest of you:

Ticket system: ""Your ticket is closed!""

User's mailbox: ""I'm out of the office.""

Ticket system to us: ""A new note was added to a ticket you opened.""

Ticket system to user: ""This ticket is closed. Please open a new ticket.""

User's mailbox: ""I'm out of the office.""

Ticket system to us: ""A new note was added to a ticket you opened.""

Ticket system to user: ""This ticket is closed. Please open a new ticket.""

User's mailbox: ""I'm out of the office.""

Repeat until the team gets back in on Monday morning to revert the change.

&#x200B;

We told as many people as we could to momentarily turn off their out of office message to keep the spam bearable. Some people jumped off the call and disappeared for the weekend, leaving us (and themselves) with a weekend long deluge of emails...

Tried to call them on Saturday to get someone to come in and just hit the big undo button. Found out on Monday that their manager (the only one we have a phone number for) went on vacation that weekend without her phone...

&#x200B;

There's two lessons to learn here:

One, NEVER EVER deploy to production at 5PM on a Friday.

and two, if you're going to automate replies to emails, be ready for the recipient to ALSO have automated replies to emails...",166,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D09BEEE0>

Minutes later, she gets an email from a user who can't find the version number. So they got on a call.

User gets on a browser (can't recall which), goes to the address bar and typed google.com. That was it. User literally thought they were the same thing.

Her: *getting flustered and angry* “but I need the files now! Why can’t you fix this?”

Me: “I can only help with issues that happen in our company. I’m sorry but there’s nothing I can do”

Is this what my life is like now in IT?",81,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D09BEFA0>
992,It pays to listen!,"So while my direct title in the company I work for isn't exactly IT, it is well known my talents on the computer far exceed just about everyone in the unit. That bit of trivia makes me the prime target when it comes to employee training of ""If you need any help, just ask ""me""."" When you're dealing with people who look at a computer in awe, you know it's never going to be good.

This is where patience is really tested. We had a couple of new hires this week and neither one of them were very bright when it came to using a computer. Now mind you, I have my own work to do as well so I don't necessarily have time to constantly drop what I'm doing to assist these people when it should be upper management or HR that helps these people out. But what kills me to no end is how people don't listen to what you're telling them.

Just because you are not tech savvy, that's not an excuse to act completely clueless and incompetent. So here is a few exchanges that I've had with the new hires while they're doing their training. We'll just say I'm Jason, and then there's NH1 and NH2, New Hire to be exact.

NH1: Hey Jason, can you help me out with this? I don't know what to do.  
Me: \*rolls over to their cubicle\* Sure, what do you need?  
NH1: I can't figure out what happened, I'm working on this course but every time I click on it, it just starts this over.  
Me: \*looks it over\* So, what happens if you click on ""this button""?  
NH1: I did, and it just starts over again.  
Me: \*a bit perplexed\* Okay...so what happens if you click on this icon here? \*NH1 does so and it starts over again\*  
NH1: See? It's not working, I don't know what to do.  
Me: \*Thinking NH1 was lying about clicking on the button I asked about, I phrase it differently\* Have you tried clicking on ""this button (read it back to them this time)"". \*NH1 clicks on it and it proceeds\*   
NH1: Oh! Now it's finally working. I don't know how you figured that out. 

Um...the button I originally asked you about that you told me you clicked on...that's how. Now a few minutes later, NH2 chimes in.

NH2: Jason, I need some help, this isn't working right.  
Me: \*rolls over to their cubicle\* Okay, what's this issue?  
NH2: I can't figure out what to do with this screen. (It's a replica of our intranet homepage, and the course was on SDS).  
Me: Oh, I know how to get past this. Just click on the box at the top middle part of the screen where it says search.  
NH2: \*looks totally lost, then starts moving their mouse around and stopping it at random spots\* Here? \*Mouse is over the top right part of the screen\*  
Me: No, you need to go more to the left.  
NH2: \*Starts moving the mouse downwards instead and finds something else totally unrelated\* Here?  
Me: \*I'm getting irritated at this point because I've dealt with people who do this all the time\* No, that's not the top middle of the screen, that's the lower right. Move your mouse upwards to the top part of the screen and in the middle where there's (a very obvious) white search bar, click in that.  
NH2: \*moves the mouse up all the way and way over to the left on the address bar\* Here?  
Me: No! Right here! \*finally gets up and physically points to it on the screen\*.   
NH2: Oh, okay! Man, you're really good with computers.

Yeah, I am. But this is just a simple case of listening problems, has nothing to do with being good at computers. I finally get back to my work for about 5 minutes and then NH1 gets my attention again.

NH1: Jason, my screen went blank. What do I do?  
Me: \*rolls back from my cubical to theirs\* Oh, the software just timed out, you just need to refresh the page and it'll bring you back.  
NH1: \*proceeds to go up to the X and clicks on it\* Oh no, what happened to it??  
Me: \*really suppressing how annoyed I'm getting\* It's okay, just open your start menu and click on Google Chrome to get back into it.  
NH1: What's a start menu?  
Okay, fair enough...Windows hasn't openly said ""Start"" on the start menu since Vista. So I try a different approach.  
Me: Go to the lower left of the screen and click on the little white Windows logo and click on it.  
NH1: \*hovers over the recycle bin on the desktop\* This?  
Me: No...all the way to the bottom and then all the way to the left of the screen.  
NH1: \*manages to get it open\* Okay, now what?  
Me: The list is in alphabetical order, go down to the Gs and find Google Chrome.  
NH1: \*starts at it for what seems to be an eternity and then happens to notice the Microsoft Edge icon on the taskbar\* Wait, you mean this thing? \*hovers over it\*  
Me: \*feels himself die inside just a bit\* No...that's not what you're looking for, it's in the start menu under G, it says Google Chrome, it has a multicolored ball as an icon.  
NH1: What's an icon?  
Me: Uhhh....it's the little picture next to the words.  
NH1: Oh, you mean like this! \*happens to actually pick out Google Chrome this time\*  
Me: Yes, that's it! Click on it!  
NH1: \*Does those stupid overexaggerated clicks while moving the mouse half way across the desk at the same time\* It didn't work.  
Me: \*literally screaming inside at this point\* You moved your mouse while you were clicking...try not to move it and just press down on the left mouse button.

Finally after all this, I manage to get them back into their learning center and figure...now I can get back to work. Not 2 minutes later.

NH1: Jason, I can't find my training.  
Me: \*Looks at their screen\* Okay, just click on My Transcript on the right hand side of the screen and it'll list what you have to do and what is already in progress.  
NH1: \*stares mystified\* Up here? \*hovering over a useless picture\*  
Me: No, it's on the right hand side of the screen.  
NH1: Oh, okay. I see it now. \*proceeds to move the mouse over there and tries clicking on...nothing\* It's not doing anything.  
Me: You need to click on the text for it to work.  
Now I don't get this part, because some many people do it. They think they have to click at either the very beginning of the text or after it...but never actually ON the text.  
NH1: I clicked on it and it doesn't do anything.  
Me: You need to hover over the text and it'll turn into a finger and when it's a finger, that means you can click on it.  
Now the game of Parkinson's comes into play and for whatever reason they couldn't hover over somewhat large text to make it into a finger and instead just keeps randomly trying to click on it. At this point I just take the mouse out of their hand and I do it for them, kind of Nick Burns style.  
NH1: Oh, there we go!  
I just did the rest to get them back into their training. 

This went on for a couple of hours, finally I went on a much needed break and when I got back, they were leaving for the day. I never wanted to beat myself so much in the head. Again, failure to listen has absolutely nothing to do with not knowing how to use a computer.

And now a bonus from NH2, the next day (which was Friday).

NH2: \*comes waltzing into the room I'm in with my fiancee (who also works at the same unit) and has that look of ""I need you"" and a little smirk.\* Jason...the computer broke.  
Me: What do you mean? How is it broken?  
NH2: Well, the room went dark.  
Me: You mean the room lost power? (Granted, I'm sure it's on a different breaker but I still found it odd.)  
NH2: The lights went out and the computer shut off.  
Me: \*my fiancee (we'll call her Krystal) could tell I was agitated so she took him back into the room while I stayed where I was, wondering what the heck could've happen this time\*  
After some time, Krystal comes back into the room.  
Me: Well...what happened exactly?  
Krystal: Since he didn't move for a while, the automatic lights shut off in the room and then he ended up bumping the switch on the monitor, turning the monitor off.  


I just let out a deep sigh and prayed for mercy at this point. I'm not paid enough to deal with these sort of things.",46,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D09BF040>
993,This knob ? It’s part of the test procedure…. the tale of the $Million telescope crash,"Many decades ago I was an engineer working for a company that made weird equipment. Big telescopes that were used to track missiles and satellites as they wooshed up up and away. And I worked with the Best Technician In The World. We will call him Bob. Bob was so good he would get flown out on an F-15 to a classified site to work on a classified airborne optical system.

But Bob had a Bad Day. He was running a servo response test on an elevation drive (tilt up, tilt down). All good. He’s got a signal generator running and a spectrum analyzer hooked up and is running the drive on a nice sinusoid pattern. And the telescope is happily nodding. 

Bob reached for the frequency knob for the next test. But just then, lovely young Sally sauntered past. Bob was badly distracted by the standing wave evident in her blouse. And turned up the gain instead.

KaWHOOM !

The drive responded with full power. Whipped up, and back down at way past max speed. Broke off the emergency stop sensor. And crashed into the hard stop, breaking it off. 

And bending the telescope tube. Fucking it for all time. A lovely 1.5 meter Schmitt Cassegrain scope was toast.

Bob turned off the power. Bob picked up his coat. His hat. His lunch box. And went home. And got very very drunk.

His boss went to his house a day later and begged him to come back to work. He did , a week later. 

And the telescope ? We had a spare tube . The glass was okay. Took a week to pull it apart and put back together and calibrate, but all was well.

After that, Bob started putting up cardboard and plywood walls while doing tests to avoid distractions.

And Sally ? She features in another story about the use of a FLIR camera, leading edge auto tracking, and how you can use IR imaging to determine which couples are having nooners.",126,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D09BF0A0>
994,You're in BIG trouble. The boss is looking for you.,"No good deed goes unpunished.

I grab a ticket: ""\[BigWig #2\] in \[largest software company in the World\], wants a new computer.""

Cool. I get to deliver and setup  a brand-new system for someone important! I'm bringing the GOOD stuff!

I love imagining the way people feel when they use a new system for the first time, especially after they've struggled with an older one for a while.

Getting the configuration work done at the end of the day, I decide to make his morning, by installing it before I go home.

Grabbing all the new stuff, keyboard, mouse, PC, etc., I go to his liberally windowed, corner office to  finish the job.

OH MY GOD. HIS OFFICE.

Star Wars, Star Trek, toys, figures, everywhere, anything ever printed with ""Star"" on it, is sitting on shelves, multiple levels, completely around the office.

Colorful stuff, all wrapped in plastic, new, immaculate, modern.

I look at his ""old"" system. It's oooold. His keyboard is the most basic, grungy white, $15 membrane type, and has letters that have been completely worn through, the PC has streaks of ""stuff"" running down the sides, it's a dirty, scummy, noisy, thing. The mouse was the basic, white, 2-button, OS2-looking museum piece.

I'm thinking, as I look over the cart filled with brand-spanking-newness ""Oh man, is he EVER going to love this NEW stuff. I mean, just the cool-looking MS multimedia keyboard is a bright blue with knobs and dials...""

I get it all setup and tested, and, as I'm leaving, toss the old stuff in the trash outside of his door.

Walking back to my office, that voice in the back of my head starts talking.....

""Hey, smart guy, have a quick question for ya; now why would a guy with such an interest in Star Wars and Star Trek be using such old equipment? I mean he's \[BigWig #2\] in \[largest software company in the World\] whos policy is to replace EVERY PC that's 3 years old, right? He can have ANYTHING.""

""But,"" I reply back to myself; ""the shiznit I just dropped-off is sooo COOL... and MODERN... and CLEAN! And, he's a top leader of one of the most advanced corporations on the planet, so surely he'd want the modern, and productive, stuff!"" 

""Yeah, yeah, of course you're right, WHO wouldn't want all of that?!?!? Why would I even ask such a thing. Sorry to bother you.""

I'm about 3/4 of the way back to my office, and stop.

""Fuck.""

Turning around, I go back and grab the scummy keyboard and sad example of a mouse from the trash. The PC stays though, I have my standards.

The grungy keyboard and ""I won't click anymore"" mouse go back to my office, and into a cabinet... just in case.

Next day, I come to work a bit late, and am greeted with ""Hey, I think you're in big trouble, the boss has been looking for you."" Pro tip in support, when the boss ""has been"" looking for you, it's NEVER for a pleasant reason.

The boss tells me ""Mr \[BigWig #2\] is looking for that stuff you replaced last night. You didn't... THROW IT AWAY did you?...!!!"" As if he isn't fully aware of our policy to get rid of junk and trash immediately. And that the trash is taken-out every night.

""Yep, sure did, like we always do! Didn't he love all of the new, shiny, modern, WORKING hardware? I mean, his new mouse now has 4 BUTTONS, OMG! The freakin' keyboard has MULTIMEDIA CONTROLS!""

""No."" Boss says. ""THAT keyboard and mouse were the very first ones he's used since college. He wants them back, now, WHATEVER IT TAKES."" Mr \[BigWig #2\] is like 50+ years old now, WTF?!?! Since college?!?!

""HA!"" Inner voice yells at me. ""TOLD YOU SO!""

\[I sigh\]

Opening the cabinet, I pull out the items. ""These old things?""

\[boss\] ""You DIDN""T throw everything away then?""

\[me\] ""Well, the PC went to the recycler, but I hung on to these. Something told me that it wouldn't be appreciated, and I was right."" ""That PC though, was a risk for the entire organization and it needed to be removed from the network, so it's gone for real.""

\[boss\] ""Well, go do the needful and make him happy.""

I take the IT junk to \[BigWig #2\] office and, as usual, he's not there.

Replacing the new, shiny, modern equipment with the old scummy, grungy stuff, I couldn't help myself and cleaned just a tiny spot on the keyboard.

I like to think that he occasionally looks at that spot and thinks; ""Damn, there's a part of my college education I'll never get back...\[sad emoji\]""

I learned later that, almost all of the items in his office were given to him by others, who think he has a fetish for Star Wars and the like.

Sometime it's all for show, for others to see. To establish your worthiness of position or class. But it all can be fake, fake, fake.

995,The opposite of Read-Only Friday,"So this happened today.

My team is in charge of hardware at a government-funded research lab. We crunch enormous amounts of data on extremely powerful hardware (a researcher once told me 500TB would be considered a 'small' dataset). Roughly half our computing estate of \~2,000 machines is dedicated to processing batch jobs. It gets expanded every year, sometimes more than once, according to the budget. There's around 100 machines in each generation. Usually, there's a fairly formal commissioning process, involving benchmarking and stress-testing to find any potential lemons, as well as collect power use stats for the data centre operators. However, a combination of factors (and covid) has led to a noticeable part of the current batch farm being unavailable for jobs at present, and many delays in us getting last year's hardware ready to rack. As a result, our team has been under pressure to get the latest generation into use as quickly as possible. For those who like hardware, if I said each machine has 64 cores, 128 threads, 512GB of RAM, 4TB of SSD and 25Gb ethernet, and there's 110 of them, imagine how eager the guys who run the software side of the farm are to get their hands on them. These machines run flat out 24/7/365 for about 5 years of service.

So, we accommodate as best we can. We get the hardware racked (5 racks worth), new switches and PDUs installed and configured to monitor network and power, spec the machines in our management infrastructure and set them up for automatic install. We put an OS on to check the machines work, then we update all the firmware to latest before running our benchmarks.

Unfortunately we hit a snag here - unbeknownst to us, this brand-new generation of machines has a quirk whereby updating the BIOS resets it to factory defaults. The supplier we bought the machines from has specifically tweaked the BIOS for us for maximum performance. The defaults result in a 30% drop in performance. And it's not a simple process to put it all back by hand. So that set us back by over a day - a colleague and I had to change the boot settings on all 110 machines by hand just to get them to start up. But it'll be worth it, right?

So after finally being told about a tool that can re-apply the BIOS settings in bulk, we move to the next step in the process - benchmarking. We decide on a truncated series of tests that'll give us the numbers we need, but nothing more. These take about 24 hours to run. A colleague even remotes in on his day off to collect the outputs so we can hand over the machines today. Usually we do a fresh install of the machines before handover to remove our benchmark stuff, but my boss, under pressure, agrees to hand them over as is, and let the software team handle the rest through config management.

Being government, one of the perks of this place is leaving an hour early on Fridays. So there I am an hour later, still on my work laptop, browsing Reddit, when who should pop up on Slack but the head of the software team, the guy we handed these machines over to only hours earlier.

$ST:  <17:07> ""Hey $me, the new machines haven't picked up their config-management profiles. I try to SSH into them and I get a password prompt \[rather than normal key auth\]. I know it's late on Friday but can you quickly poke a machine or two and tell me what the state of them is?

$me: <17:08> ""That's unusual, what did you apply?""

$ST: ""I set all the machines to reinstall the OS. I want to run a newer kernel and doing this on a running OS would cause package conflicts.""

At 5PM on Friday?

I open up the IPMI to one of the machines and check. It's running its usual post-installation script - on a good day, our automated installation setup will finish in 30-40 minutes. On these blazing-fast SSD-based machines, 20 is more normal, so these have definitely been started after most people left for the day. I move onto the next machine in the batch.

A random bug in the post-installation system is that sometimes the network doesn't come up on first boot. It's unpredictable, but without network, the script just hard-errors-out and leaves you with a blank machine - no accounts, no software, nada. The only way in is via the local console as root. Experience tells me new hardware is particularly susceptible to the bug.

Sure enough, the next machine is running the base kernel. Signing into the console, I find the logs indicate the bug struck. Okay, not complicated, bring the network up manually and restart the script (which will configure the network permanently).

Right, one down... Oh right, 108 more to go. I'm the only one from the team still online and the only one $ST can see who knows the root passwords. I plod through about 20 machines and get them all kicked in the right direction before deciding I can't spend my entire weekend doing this. $ST is grateful for the ones that are now running. The rest will have to wait in their limbo state until Monday.

When me and whoever else I can convince to help, will have to go through the remaining $n machines, manually open the console, log in and run the magic commands to complete the post-install stuff. Suffice to say, $ST will be buying donuts next week.

Moral of the story - when weekend clocking-off time rolls around, close your company IM immediately...",22,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D09BF160>
