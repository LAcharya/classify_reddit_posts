0,Washing Machine (Update),"Awhile back I posted [this story](https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheFrontDesk/comments/titoii/im_straight_up_going_to_have_to_quit/) , and promised an update.

TL;DR I work at a hotel, and for months we were having to bring our linens to the hotel we own next door to be washed. This more than doubled the burden on that machine, which was older than the broken one at our property. Then that machine broke.

Someone mentioned that it could potentially take months to get a new one delivered, because of everything going on with the supply chain these days.

Later. I updated that post to add that our housekeeper had seen one at the GM/owner's house. I didn't necessarily believe her, because why on Earth would you want to deal with constant delays with laundry, and the optics of guests seeing us rolling carts of laundry next door every day? 

That said, it would be a weird thing to lie about. The GM does occasionally pay HK under the table to do work at her house, but I thought surely she just saw a fancy looking washing machine.

Nope. Unless some shipping miracle occurred, it has definitely just been sitting at her house for months. I came in today, and sure enough we have a brand new washer installed, and we're just waiting for the concrete to dry.

I'll never understand this place. Why were we using the washer next door maintenance described after ""repairing"" it as a ""fire hazard"" for five whole days if she had a brand new machine in her house? My coworker thinks that she put it off, so it wouldn't seem like she just had it the whole time, and it wouldn't seem like she was just wasting everyone's time by sending them next door for months.

UPDATE:

The FDM from next door came in, and told me that after our new washer was installed, they took the old one next door, and acted like it was some gift for them, because ""Now you've got two washers!"" What? They fixed the washer next door using parts from the broken washer. Broken is broken. You just dropped off trash next door.",5,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEFB6FA0>
1,More Mr Patel... he's still around,"So, I came in today for my shift and a new hire (NH) had been working with our manager (M) because we're busy and they're still in training. During the morning shift, they received a phone call, which NH answered. After some pleasantries, Mr Patel demanded ""Do you know who I am?"" and NH apologized and confessed they didn't know this guy (why would they?). 

Of course, Mr Patel, being the asshat we all know him to be scolded the new hire and insisted they were the owner. NH said ""Oh, let me give you to the manager"" and passed the phone to M. 

M answered pleasantly and let the man go on, insisting they were owner. Luckily, though, even my manager hadn't somehow heard of the common Mr Patel scam, she sensed something was amiss. She simply said ""Well, I know all our owners and you aren't one of them."" and hung up the phone. 

See, even though its very common for hotels to be owned by those of Indian decent or from actual India, we are one of the approximately 20% that are not. We're owned by 3 white dudes. 

Upon hearing this story, I told M about how popular Mr Patel was on this subreddit and even showed her a few stories, she then insisted I share ours. We now have a memo on letterhead in our log book that specifically says none of our owners are named Patel and he's a scammer.",5,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEFE9D30>
2,Speaking of airlines and cab companies...,"Haven't posted in a while was inspired by another TFtFD!

So... this week, my airline crew, one person in particular has been bitching about not having a pillow in his bed bag for the pull out. In the room. He sleeps alone in. On a bed. with like five pillows. He did this all last week and he did this for a good part of this week. This morning when he came stomping up to my desk (fully waiting for him to bitch about the pillow... again) and rudely tossed his keys at me yelling; ""Have you heard from the shuttle!?""

Quick FYI! We only provided a bed. We do not arrange reservations, we do not arrange shuttles. Lodgings are done via a 3rd party company and we are not associated with the shuttle service we only have phone numbers that never picks up for the two of them!

Anywho... After tossing keys and yelling at me I tell him, ""no I have not"" to which he goes on this super angry rant about; ""Well, we told them we were going to back on the first and we've paid out of our pockets for a cab three days now and I'm going to leave them a message and if I don't here from them I'm calling the police!"" 

I bit my tongue but I really wanted to go; ""And tell them what!? Oo, ohhh! The cab never showed!! Arrest them!"" Like sorry dude, but you're a special kind of pain in the ass for me so maybe, just maybe! Maybe... you're a pain in the ass for them?!?"" Like we have a fax that says which of the flight crew are staying with us that night. Maybe they do too? And see your name and are like; ""Hah! Fuck that!!"" and peel out!? I dunno! But either way, I just chuckled and went back to work, surfing reddit, doodling, chatting on telegram/discord, you know? The important duties of the super done night auditor! <:3

Peace and love my fellow night ghouls! <3<3<3",4,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CDC44E80>
3,Taxis.,"Another story today? Why not! I have something else to rant about anyway. Well, today, I’m going to rant about [taxis](https://youtu.be/fYGR5JtyKng) and the joys of getting people the hell out of my lobby.

Two cab companies in town lost their licenses recently. One of which is not only a cab company we have a speed dial button for on our front desk phone but also, the one that has the contract with Canada’s shittiest airline. So, the flight crew has to pretend they care about not being able to get to the airport, as if [we don’t all already know this particular airline is a national embarrassment that comedians have kvetched about](https://youtu.be/j-x_hCIZr1o) and that has stranded people in this hotel for a week a couple months ago.

But, naturally, I’m the one holding the bag and when I arrived on shift last night, I was greeted with a phone call from the OTA that deals with a subcontractor for Canada’s shittiest airline. Apparently, they want us to reimburse the flight crew for a taxi that we need to book for them. I tell them that I’d love to but I need to get approval from my manager. So, as I’m calling my manager, the flight crew arrive and rock up to the front desk, so I get back to the OTA and tell them their people are already here. And when they need to get back to the airport to fail at being a decent airline, I need to call a cab company to come get the flight crew. So, I try Cab Company #2. And they say they’ll send someone. Cool. We should be good, right? Well, no. The cabbie takes one look at the flight crew and decides to jet the hell out of the hotel loading area. So, I try Decent Cab Company and they’re able to help the flight crew for Canada’s shittiest airline get to the airport and do their job to disappoint 70 people.

Add to this the fact that one of my coworkers is telling guests that he’s making them cab reservations that he isn’t actually making and this makes for a fun night audit shift. FML.",3,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D09BF550>
4,“Are you sure you don’t want to go to the hospital?” “No.” “Okay…”,"So, today’s guest is someone I feel kinda bad about checking into our hotel. Not because I don’t like the person (she gave me a $40 tip, so why wouldn’t I like her?) but rather, because I have no fucking idea how the hell she’s going to move about… especially since she told me she has errands she has to “run around town” today. You’ll see why I doubt this in a minute.

You see, a few hours ago, I get a call asking me whether I have room for a hospital patient. I said yes. We check people in who are fresh out of the hospital all the time. But when this woman comes in, I ask myself what doctor in his right mind would check this patient out? She’s not mobile enough to be moving around independently and even I can see this when the taxi driver has to help her into the hotel. She’s not really able to bend, or do much physically. Movements on her own are slow. Needless to say, I recognize that I have to make this the smoothest check in possible as if she can’t get in here, getting somewhere else is gonna be a problem. Little did I know that this is true in more ways than one, as she didn’t have a cell phone on her.

Rate? Well, I’ll get you the super-special-awesome rate for one of the two First Nations we have a deal with.

Cash? Sure, I’ll take a payment in cash even though I don’t feel like dropping $120 of cash.

Debit card? Uh… need to take a $300 deposit when this lady checks in, which is where things go downhill. Naturally, she tries to use her debit card to pay for the $300 deposit and it is declined. I try running it as a credit card in the vain hope that I can get her in and officially make her someone else’s problem. No dice. This is the one thing I can’t get around, lest the Front Desk Manager bite my head off like some reverse praying mantis action. She offers to go to the ATM to get the money so she can check in. I think to myself, your card was declined when we tried the debit machine, what makes you think the ATM is going to be any different? But I don’t say that aloud.

Needless to say, she’s been back to the ATM and she doesn’t have the money. It’s 3:30am and people are starting to line up to check out and get a receipt. I can’t do this until I run the night audit process and I can’t do that until I either check her in or cancel her reservation. So, I cancel her reservation, run the night audit process and she’s sitting in my lobby, in a chair. I’m a little pissed off and am working to finish the process, get people checked out and keep the hotel moving. The hubbub dies down. Cabs are called, people come and go, and this lady is still sitting in my lobby… even when the flight crew starts coming down. At 4:00am-ish. But around this time, I get a call from her mother. She gives me a credit card for her, I get authorization to use it for this stay, and I can get her in house. So, we’re good, right? Wrong. This is where things start getting worrisome. This is where I go from pissed to worried.

She couldn’t get up. Not on her own power and not even with me and another guest helping her. She gets an idea, though. She suggests that she could use a luggage cart as a walker in order to help her get up on her own power. I grab one and wheel it over to her. This, sadly, does not work. I try to help her get up a couple more times and she’s not able to. She’s willing, but not able. I’m pretty sure I asked her a couple times whether she wants to go to the hospital and she says no.

Then, she asks me if we have a real walker. We don’t, but I have an idea. While we don’t have a walker, we DO have a wheelchair downstairs. It’s an old piece of crap that [looks like the kind of thing Freddie Lounds from Red Dragon had a ride in](https://youtu.be/RpzJ-AUVnl0), but it’ll do for our purposes. After a little bit of help, I was able to get her into the wheelchair and to the elevator. She tips me $40 for the help and I walk her to the elevator. She gets in and goes up to the third floor.

I start walking back to the front desk but I think to myself… crap. I can’t leave her like that. What if she can’t leave the elevator? I did have to push her chair into the elevator. Frustrated, I grab the master key and rush up to the third floor. I meet her near the elevator. I push her chair, talking with her on the way to her room. She’s in her room. I’m conflicted, but at least she can get a good sleep.

She asks me to extend her stay to Sunday. I say I will (I already knew we had the room, I’ve seen the availability chart for today). And she wants a late checkout. I put her on the list for a late checkout. But I feel like shit about it. I worry that she won’t be able to get out of bed without assistance. Additionally, now that I’m home, I’m worried that since she doesn’t have anyone else on the room, we can’t let anyone upstairs to come get her. Further, with her limited mobility, I’m concerned she won’t be able to get to the phone in time if we need to reach her (the phones are on the desks, not next to the beds). She shouldn’t have been let out of the hospital. She shouldn’t be in our hotel. I hope she’s okay.",6,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF53D4C0>
5,Misunderstanding makes guest freak out and think she's being stalked.,"This memory came back to me by reading another post. This happened about 12ish years ago. 

I was working the afternoon shift and had a lady come to check in. 

After she tells me her name, it seems I can't find her in the system. I tell her I don't have a reservation under her name, but we do have rooms available. So I check her in with no issues. 

&#x200B;

A few hours pass and she calls me from her room. She tells me she's just received a call from someone claiming to be from the front desk telling her to come check in as she's not showing as checked in in the system. 

I tell her I'm the only one working at the time, and I had not called her. She gets very scared and paranoid that someone is stalking her she refuses to leave her room. 

I ask her if it's ok to go speak to her and that I could bring security with me so she'd feel safer. She agrees. 

I come up, she looks through the peep hole, and once she opens, this woman looks really terrified. She explains the whole thing to me again, and apparently the person who called her said they had no one by my name working there, which freaked her out even more. 

I ask to see her cell phone's caller ID and recognize the number immediately. 

It's another big brand hotel about 20 minutes away. 

Turns out she made a reservation there, and made a mistake and came to our hotel instead. 

I called them back, explained it all. They cancelled her reservation with no penalty and it was all sorted out. But it was a very confusing moment for sure.",5,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF53D520>
6,Q. What do you get when you cross a Karen with an OTA? A corporate travel agent..... also named Karen,"Karen, Corporate Travel Agent extraordinaire.

TLDR: All Karen's are cunts.

SO, I'M WRITING THIS INTRO AFTER I'VE FINISHED WRITING NY TALE. FORGIVE ME AS IM NOT THE BEST WRITER IN THE WORLD. THIS TALE MAY SEEMS ALL OVER THE PLACE AND GOES INTO FAR TOO MUCH DETAIL....I TEND TO WRITE EVERYTHING DOWN AS IT POPS INTO MY HEAD, BUT I PROMISE ITS ALL RELEVANT TO MY TALE. 

Today's cast will be as follows:

ME: Me

PS: Poor Sucker

KAREN: Travel agent

Owner: The owner of my hotel

Ladies and Gents of the front desk,all I can say is I'm extremely glad that this call took place at the end of my shift and not the beginning.
 
Today I discover  there is an industry that actually rewards Karen's for their disgusting behavioural traits with a full time salary and commissions. 

In an age whereby any Tom,Dick and Harry can book a hotel room on the interwebs with just a few clicks, travel agents are constantly trying reinventing themselves to stay relevant.

They have discovered that the corporate travel market is a cash cow that will ensure they stay relevant.

Gone are their old regular clients that might book a family holiday overseas once a year after saving religiously.

Long gone are the glory days of being the go to person that bachelor's worldwide would consult to book that all important Vegas bachelor party weekend.........a distant memory.

No more are the long hours sitting at a desk in a store located at a local shopping centre. Why compete for sales and fight for a walk in customers attention with colleagues who you share a desk with .....that's so early 00's.

What about wall of travel brochures used to lure people into your store.... Disappeared! Those glossy travel brochures now taking up space in a storage shed.... too valuable to destroy. Covid has created a toilet paper shortage that is  just waiting to be exploited....those glossy piles of paper could potentially be sold as emergency toilet paper for a tidy profit.  

Some former travel agents have missed selling suckers useless and expensive travel insurance and found a new career flogging every other type of useless and expensive insurances in general working for a general insurer.

The explosion in OTA's popularity was just as disruptive as Uber and AirBNB and left these travel agencies wounded. Many shut shop after decades in the business and the ones that have managed to survive this long were mostly the big travel agents that franchised...its these same companies that are now marketing themselves as that all important communication conduit between their client companies and us FDA's....lucky us. 🙄

For them, it's an easy sell...

Have you got an employee/s who need to travel for work?

Too busy to look online and book it with that fancy corporate card?

Hate reimbursing employees travel expenses? 

Had an employee who's flight home was cancelled and needs a hotel room last minute for the night? Perfect.... Then let these glorified assistants with an inflated sense of self importance speed dial hotels and bully their FDA's while securing a reservation....

Welllll....ATTEMPT to secure a reservation....

A bit of background to set the scene.

I live in Brisbane, Australia managing a boutique hotel of 60 rooms over 2 properties.

My state Queensland, is a very popular tourist destination for Australian's in other states. 

After a long downturn in tourism and low occupancy rates due to Covid, domestic tourism began to really pickup before Xmas. 

For a short period in December/January, we sold out every night as people started to holiday again.

Come February, once the summer school holidays finished, reality set in as parents went back to work and kids went back to school. Our occupancy rates began to slow..to 70% during weekdays and up to 80-90% on weekends as people enjoyed stay- cation's or there were big events nearby.

Valentine's Day was predictably sold out, because, well people like to fuck in hotels on February 14th, not realising they're getting fucked twice.... Once by paying above rack rate for the room on a popular date and then by their partner.

If our housekeeping team had to pick the worst day on the calendar to work, it would be February 15th.

I promise I'm getting to the point. 

The last weekend of February was forecast to be a wet weekend. The forecast was for a large amount of rainfall on the Friday (100mm, 25 inches). 

Usually this never eventuates and after a short but heavy downpour, the sun shines again and the humidity reaches its usual 'fuck it's hot' levels. 

NOT THIS TIME. OHHH BOY IT RAINED....ALOT....IT DID NOT STOP FOR 3 DAYS....IT RAINED SO BLOODY MUCH THAT WE FORGOT WHAT THE SUN ACTUALLY LOOKED LIKE. 

As a result, my city suffered a huge flood event after 3 days of constant rain. Over 800mm (200 inches). Our main dams capacity was reported as 180% (not a typo). Controlled release of water from this dam was conducted over these 3 days. All that released increased the flooding and river levels city wide as this overflow flowed downstream and out to sea.

There were multiple deaths.

Multiple flights were cancelled on the 3rd day of rain, as was all public transport city wide  Roads were empty and people were ordered to stay home. Businesses were closed. Supermarkets (ones that remained open) shelves were stripped bare. Food delivery was non existant  as Uber doesn't offer danger pay. Fuck risking it all driving in and around flooded roads just so somebody can eat shit food. ....Like the advertisement on local TV tell us during storm season...if it's flooded, forget it. 

Airline passengers who were lucky enough to get transport from the airport faced another hurdle...if they managed to avoid flooded roads, there were no hotel rooms city wide. We did all we could by setting up  25 single mattresses in our dining room for people to rest for free and offered them a fine selection of cereals and breads from our breakfast supplies for dinner. Have you really lived if you haven't eaten cereal for dinner at least once as a grown up?

The aftermath? Thousand's people's homes have become uninhabitable and because of this, insurance companies are  placing these people into hotel accommodation, some long term, while their homes are made  inhabitable again.

Every day since, tourists and out of towners without an existing reservation are struggling to find hotel accommodation. 

Our occupancy is 100% every night, and we have maybe 1-5 rooms available to sell on any given day, normally only for a single night.

I am turning away on average about 20 people a day (walk ins and phone calls) as we sell out vacant rooms pretty quickly, mostly through OTA's and direct phone bookings. 

Our policy is to take immediate payment for the room, regardless of you're checking in today or next month. No exceptions.

We do not hold bookings for anyone.

If a booking is made online and your card has insufficient funds, we will call you and ask for an alternative form of payment or give you the opportunity to transfer money to your or we mark your card as invalid via the OTA's extranet.  
card. If  we cannot contact you your booking is cancelled within the hour.

Enter Karen, who today decided to test this policy. Nothing gets Karen's adrenaline flowing like a last minute corporate booking at 4:50pm on a Friday afternoon. She may be clocking out at 5pm, but 10 minutes should be more than enough time to bully a pesky FDA into selling her a room for her very important client.

Karen gets into the zone and adjusts her Bluetooth phone headset and microphone while simultaneously adjusting her ergonomic keyboard and mouse in preparation for battle....oh it's on like donkey Kong 

A few keystrokes and some furious mouse clicks (not furious enough to aggravate her carpal tunnel syndrome) later, she finds a what she's looking for...a hotel close to the airport. 

She licks her lips and clears her throat as she furiously dials the phone number without even looking at the phone keypad. Let the battle begin...

It's at that moment that my phone rings....it's a local landline number...my spidey senses are tingling as I answer..

Me: G'day cobber, thanks for calling the Aussie Inn, what can I do ya for.....is not how Australian's answer the phone.....let's start over.

Me: Thankyou for calling anonymous airport hotel, this is Kambah.

Karen: Hi this is Karen calling from Cunty Corporate Travel, do you have any rooms available for one guest for one night?

Me: sure do, I have one room left. It's a 2 bed apartment for $199.

Karen: Ok I'll take it, I'm sending the client your address now and he will be there in 10 minutes. Just send us your invoice on checkout. His name is Poor Sucker. What's your confirmation number for this booking?

Me: I'd be more than happy to help you. However, our policy is full payment at the time of booking. I can make the reservation over the phone with you, but I will require payment by virtual card. If you are able to generate a Virtual credit card and give me the details over the phone, I will take payment and send you a confirmation before Poor Sucker arrives to check in. 

Karen: Why does it have to be that difficult. Were Australia's largest corporate travel agent, just reserve the room and invoice us, easy. 

Me: I'm afraid that without payment I can't make that reservation. 

Karen: I've already logged out of the system that generates a VCC number. Are you saying I have to log back in, generate a number, wait for you to take payment and then wait for a confirmation number? That's alot of effort on my part for a one night booking. You know my client will be there in less than 10 minutes, are you going to make him wait around in your lobby while I generate the card? Not very good customer service.

Me: Policy is policy. 

Karen: Finnne. Can I call you back in 5 minutes with the details?

Me: Absolutely. When you're ready, call me back and I will enter the reservation into our system. Please don't leave it too long as the room is still open on the Extranet and may be booked before you call back (I say this as alot of Travel agents never call back, so we do not block/hold any rooms for them waiting for them to callback and reserve it).

Karen acknowledges this with a sarcastic sounding .. ""surrrre"" and hangs up without saying goodbye....as I roll my eyes, sigh loudly and shake my head to myself.

At that exact moment, I get a new email notification. Someone has just reserved our last room through our website. Well fuck, We are now sold out. Karen's going to be mad.....this will be fun.

I quickly scroll through caller ID on my cordless phone and dial the last number that called as I mentally psych myself up and tell Karen the great news.

No longer will she need to over exert herself and generate that sweet, sweet Virtual card number. I'm almost certain that this will be welcome news to Karen..... Even if she doesn't like what I have to say..  She is shit out of luck, were sold out.

I call once. No answer. 

So I wait a few minutes and try again. No answer.  I leave a voicemail, but after 10 minutes I hear nothing so I assume that she found somewhere else. I just hope she has told her client and pray he doesn't show up here.

30 minutes later. A young guy in his early 20s walks in.

Me: G'day mate, are you checking in?

PS: Yeah.

Me: What name is your reservation under?

PS: Sucker, Poor Sucker. 

Fuck me, it's Karen's client.

At that moment, I get that sinking feeling in my gut. 

My communication style is best described as blunt. I tell it as it is.

Me: I hate to be the bearer of shitty news Mr Sucker, but we are sold out. You're companies travel agent, Cunty, was unable to make a reservation with us. I'm afraid they sent you here without a confirmed reservation. 

PS: They told me it was all sorted and to rock up at this address to check in. So I don't have a room?

Me: Its definitely a cluster fuck, Mr Sucker. I did try and call your agent a few times after our initial contact to let her know we were sold out but she did not return my calls. 

PS: They just told me to rock up here and they'd sort the reservation out. Where am I going to stay now? 

Me: I would be happy to give you the phone numbers of a few hotels within walking distance that might have availability if you'd like?

PS: Nah, it's alright. I'll just call my boss. 

Me: Sure, feel free to sit in our lobby and help yourself to a coffee while you make arrangements.

PS: Thanks

I didn't go into too much detail with the guest about the situation, just the basics.

Even after being told the bad news, he remained calm and wasn't rude or belligerent towards me, so I was happy to help. I also felt partly responsible for his predicament. There was no millennial meltdown.

I felt really bad for the guy. I called a few hotels nearby while he called his boss to see if they had rooms, and managed to find a few options.

 10 minutes later he comes to the desk holding, placing his phone on the desk, saying it's his boss. Trying to be helpful, I agree to speak to his boss. He places the phone on speaker.

Me...Hel...

Karen: WHAT KIND OF FUCKING OPERATION ARE YOU RUNNING THERE? MY CLIENT HAD A CONFIRMED BOOKING. 

Me: Oh hi Karen, thanks for returning my call. As I said in my voicemail to you, we sold our last room online just seconds after we finished our initial call.

Karen: THATS BULLSHIT, I RESERVED THAT ROOM OVER THE PHONE.

Me: As I explained I could not make the reservation for you without a valid payment method. If my memory serves me correctly, you confirmed you understood that our policy does not allow me to make a reservation without paym....

Karen: NO YOU DID..

Me (cutting her off and raising my voice): ...Let me Finish please. I explained to you our payment policy and you said you'd generate a payment card and call me back in 5 minutes...

PS: Why did you tell me to come here without a reservation.

Karen: ...*stutters*...BUT..

Me: I'm not finished yet. Just as you hung up, we sold our last room and I called you back straight away. You didn't answer, so I called again 2 minutes later and left ba voicemail. I never heard back from you until now.

Karen: MY PHONE DIDN'T RING. YOU'RE LYING...  I BET YOU RESOLD THE ROOM FOR A HIGHER PRICE  WHILE I WAS ARRANGING PAYMENT. YOU NEED TO FIND MY CLIENT A ROOM NOW. DO YOU NOT UNDERSTAND THATS THIS IS A CORPORATE CLIENT? 

Me: I'm under no obligation to do anything for you. You dropped the ball and are now trying to shift the blame to make us look bad to your client. This conversation is over. I'm going to hang up now and help Me Sucker, something you failed to do. 

Karen: I WANT TO SPEAK TO YOUR MANAGER... NOW!!!

The owner of my hotel is my boss and he has been present during this whole interaction.

Me: I can see if my manager is available.

My boss smiles and nods that he will talk to her.

Owner: Hello, what seems to be the issue?

Karen: Your stupid receptionist fucked up my clients reservation and now you're going to fix it.

Karen then rants for about 2 minutes about her version of events.

Owner: So, just letting you know that I've been present during this whole conversation and I can confidently say that my employee has followed our policy to the letter and been nothing but helpful and transparent in his dealings with you.
You only have yourself to blame for big noting yourself and over estimating your own abilities by sending your poir client to our property before  making a reservation and receiving a confirmation, and now, because of your incompetence, You want us to fix your fuck up to save face with your client. I'm curious, do you visit your Doctor and demand he consult you immediately without an appointment? 

PS: Thanks for nothing!

Karen: HOW DARE YOU. ILL BE TAKING THIS FURTHER. ILL BE RECOMMENDING CUNTY DOES NOT MAKE ANY FUTURE BOOKINGS WITH YOUR PROPERTY AND SEND YOUR PROPERTY BROKE 

Owner: In the 10 years I've owned this place, I can count the amount of reservations by Cunty with one hand. At least threaten me with something tangible and will affect my business revenue. I'm done. Bye. 

The boss then hangs up on her mid scream. 

He then did something that I believe was done in pure spite of Cunty travel (or to further prove their uselessness to Mr Sucker). He called The owner of a a neighbouring property and called in a favour and got Me Sucker a one bedroom suite for next to nothing (under $100), and offered for our airport shuttle to take him to the airport tomorrow morning. 

I love my boss.

Thanks for listening to my TED talk.",16,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF53D580>
7,what do you mean your hotel that is 45 minutes away doesn't have an airport shuttle?,"The amount of times I have people calling to demand a shuttle ride is ridiculous. On a good day we are 45 minutes away, bad day you can double that. We are technically the next town over and have no advertising to being an ""airport hotel"". Doesn't stop the Karen's. 


Tonight about 1 am

Answer the phone and can't even get through my greeting before.


Karen: ""where are you?""

Me: ""I'm sorry?"" - has to turn the volume on the phone down-

Karen: ""Where. Are. You?""

Me: ""we are located in - town name-"" 

Karen: *scoffs* ""I know that. But I have been waiting here for almost 30 minutes."" 

Me: confused I pull up all the cameras and check every one, there's no one around the property. ""I'm sorry Ma'am I don't see you on our cameras, are you possibly...."" 

Karen: of course I'm not on the camera's I'm at the airport.

Me: oooookkkk, then how can I assist you?

Karen: you can start by cutting the attitude and getting your driver to hurry up.


Me: Our driver? Ma'am we don't.....

Karen: yes your driver, do I have to repeat everything to you?

Me: Ma'am we don't offer shuttle service.

Karen: of course you offer shuttle service. You are a hotel aren't you? 

Me: yes ma'am but we are too far away from the airport to have a shuttle. 

Karen: well how am I supposed to get to you then! 

Me: Most guests use Uber or Lyft if they aren't renting a car. 

Karen: I will not be getting in anyone's filthy car. Send a driver for me now or I will be writing a very bad review and contacting your manager. 

Me: *tired of being screamed at* 
what is the name on your reservation? 

Karen gives it to me. She's not a member, she's using a discount and is only staying for one day. 

Me: thank you, alright I've gone ahead and canceled that reservation for you at no charge. There are plenty of hotels by the airport who will provide shuttles. Have a good night. 

Hangs up and proceeds to ignore the next 3 times she calls. (God bless caller ID)",142,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF53D5E0>
8,I dunno why there are towels in the door crack,"One thing that always makes me laugh is how a surprising amount of guests think that everyone who works in a hotels (sans managers and owners) are stupid? 

Front Desk Agents? Distracted, Dumb, and very easy to persuade/convince

Housekeepers? Ah, they don't understand English so we can say or do whatever with them

It goes on and on.

Anyway, while it is getting kind of rare these days for us to see guests with that mentality, they do come to my hotel.

It's mostly in the case of locals who are entitled when they come here and do not really care what happens.

One recent example is a few weeks ago. At my hotel, we would have two different people work Night Audit a week: one who works five days in the week, and one who works two days to give the other Night Audit her off time. The person who usually works Night Audit for the two days also works at one of our sister locations, so the owners decided to make her work at the other location more and moved me to Night Audit twice a week (for context, this was technically my third time working at this location, and I was technically temporary part-time with an easy exit clause due to looking for a career out of college. I was working whatever shifts they needed me to, which was mostly afternoons, but I was not expecting NA (I did have experience from before, so it wasn't that bad)).

On my second week of doing NA again, I got a noise complaint on the top floor. I went up to investigate and I can hear music blaring even from the elevator (room was halfway down the hall). When I knocked, the person who answered was a young adult at the oldest and there were four other people in there, all of them looked and sounded like the stereotypical local (which they were when I checked the reservation later). I told them to turn the music down as someone called to complain. Instead of saying ok or sorry, the dude said, and I quote ""Nah fam, that's not music. That's the TV."" Oh, that totally make it alright, Carry on. No! I told him regardless, he needs to turn it down as it was past 1am and people are sleeping, and if someone calls to complain about noise or I hear it in the hallway again, they would need to leave. He says ok and I ""leave.""

I actually didn't leave, I just stood by the now closed door until it was turned down to a respectable level for the middle of the night. After about half a minute of nothing happening, I hear one of the people in the room say ""Is he gone?"" And another one saying ""No, he's still there,"" right before the volume finally turned down. While my co-worker if she heard them say that would knock on the door and give them a sterner warning, I tend to have more patience, which can be a downside sometimes.

Fast forward about a half hour, I was in-between tasks and decided to do a walk of the halls and make sure everything was good, but mostly I wanted to make sure that that room didn't crank up their volume again. As I got to the second floor, thankfully I didn't hear anything when I got off the elevator, but as I approached the area where the room was located, it hits me: weed. Even when I was congested and starting to get a cold, the pungent odor still found a way to penetrate my sinuses, so it was fresh (plus too, it was not there less than a half hour ago when I was there).

As anyone who is a FDA knows, if there are not many rooms sold and/or there is very few, if not one room sold on a wing of the hotel, it is very easy to deduce origins of odors as well as figure out which room people are going to. As I ran down to get a smoking claim sheet, I checked which rooms were occupied on that floor's wing, and even if I didn't suspect it was the room I thought it was, it was easy to figure out: there were three rooms occupied on that wing, the one who called the noise complaint and whom I knew for a fact was asleep, one was a regular nurse who works overnights at a hospital a mile away (and was working this night), and the room that had the noise complaint.

Even though I was 99% sure it was that room, because of the hour, I still had to investigate for sake of a potential witch hunt complaint or something. First thing I did was I went outside and checked if the window was open. I could not tell. Next, I did the tried and true ""sniff under the doors"" test, purposely smelling the room I suspected last so I won't have to lie if they claim ""you went to our room first because we are a specific race"" card that people like to pull (and which people have pulled in the past with me).

When I got to their room, I looked under the door and before I can smell, I saw something white. After shining my phone flashlight to confirm, it was indeed the room's towels shoved against the door crack. A smoking (pun not intended) gun for smoking in the room. I knocked and a different person came to the door. I said there was a strong weed smell in the hallway with a slight haze and I need to investigate before I invited myself in. I looked around for a few seconds and noted the window wide open with two people sitting by it and confirmed by my site there was a thick barrier of towels that were indeed in front of the door. Because the window was open, I could smell mostly the wet outside at this point and enough smell to indicate that someone smoked weed (but not enough to state for a fact it was here and then), but there was a slight haze in the room still to indicate something was lit.

I asked if they were smoking in here. The person who let me in denied it of course. I asked him why there were towels in front of the door crack. I did take a picture of the door crack before I knocked as evidence that the towels were indeed blocking the door crack in case someone says they were used towels they just threw there. He says ""I dunno. \[other person\] put them there."" ""Is he here?"" ""No"" ""Where's Sally Smith (name on the reservation, not her real name)"" ""She's not here. She's at work."" Well, this was a bit of an issue. Usually, we want the person on the reservation to sign the smoking claim since it is her card being charged, but at the same time, if someone else in the room signs it, if something were to happen, it is easy to prove knowledge of the person/the person was in the room with all the cameras we have (not to mention, signing the form is just acknowledging it. We still charge the card regardless. Signing it just means we won't necessary kick you out, but not signing it gives us the right to kick you out right there and then). He does sign it without protest and I post the charge. I should've just kicked them all out, especially since they did have the noise complaint, but after collecting myself for a second, I decide to just change their reservation from two days to checking out in the morning. After five minutes of making sure I posted the smoking fee and the correct unregistered guest fees (yes, my hotel does that), I went back up to let them know they will be checking out in the morning. After a few different attempts of knocking with no answer, I proclaimed that I was coming in, used the master key, and nobody was in there. I left a note on the dresser and never seen any of them the rest of my shift.

This all took place before audit. After audit, I tried charging the card for the remaining money owed from all the additional fees (well over $150 of the $300+ fees after using up the money from their original second night & our incidental charge), and surprise surprise, it declined. I put a push charge on it, which meant that the $150+ would get sent to us automatically whenever there were funds on the card (debit).

Come to find from the morning shift the next day that everyone who was in the room was no older than 16 and the person who checked in (who was barely 21) was never in the room! Another thing that they thought they can try to sneak past us.

I know some hotels straight up do not accept locals into their hotels, but what we do is require a large incidental in cash, which the person who checked them in didn't get.

This story ended up getting longer than I wanted, but the premise is, I don't get why guests act like us FDAs etc. are stupid and easily persuaded. Playing dumb won't make us believe you",6,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF53D640>
9,Coworker keeps making up stories about guest,"Coworker exaggerates negative guest interactions in order to get them removed and Dnr'd . Every single negative interaction he has is reported as the guest making threats or making racial slurs . I've witnessed him have normal disagreements with guest then he spins it saying they where aggressive and he had to threaten to call the police.he then types this into a report . Management is aware of his behavior but doesn't care enough to do anything.  Management just jokes about how one day a guest will actually threaten him and no one will believe him .




Very annoying plenty of nice people are banned from staying here because he made up a story to get em kicked out .",13,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF53D6A0>
10,"Your job isn't to make decisions, MY job is to make decisions."," This is the story of my non Reddit using sister's Malicious Compliance when a new General Manager took over her hotel. Some folks over at the r/MaliciousCompliance subReddit suggested that I post this here.

My  sister (Fedral's Sister) has been in the hospitality field since she  got out of high school. She started at the front desk, but worked just  about every job having to do with the hotel business (Housekeeping,  night audit, reservations, etc)

At  the time of this story she had been the assistant hotel manager for  quite a while, and had a fantastic working relationship with her General  Manager (Competent GM). She would handle all the day to day minutiae,  guest issues, employee problems, leaving 'Competent GM' to handle the  bigger issues and increase the business. This well known hotel brand was  located outside the major airport, and was the layover hotel for a lot  of aircrew, and weary travelers, and was always at or near capacity.

Fast  forward a couple of years and her 'Competent GM' is promoted up the  chain, and a new GM (Micromanaging GM) takes over. He decides to lay  down the law that he doesn't care how things were done under the  'Competent GM', he was in charge now, and his word was law. All the  staff were taken aback, as they had great customer feedback, and their  occupancy numbers were always spectacular, and someone who was looking  to disturb that was concerning. What was worse, 'Micromanaging GM' had  just moved to the area, and had yet to find an apartment, and was  staying at the hotel, ensuring that he was always lurking about,  aggravating the staff in their daily tasks.

My  sister did everything she could to shield her people from  'Micromanaging GM's' antics, all the while handling the day to day of  the hotel front desk. My sister, was used to handling guest complaints,  and would regularly do whatever it took to keep angry guests happy, be  it giving 'comps', moving rooms, whatever it too to keep people content.  Once, after upgrading an irritated guest to a better room,  'Micromanaging GM' pulled her aside to chew her out for doing that  without permission. My sister said that the had been instructed by  'Competent GM' to do whatever it took to keep the hotel running  smoothly. He said "" Your job isn't to make decisions, My job is to make  decisions. You don't do anything in the future without permission.""

My sister, being my sister engaged Nuclear Malicious Compliance.

""Yes sir? You have a complaint about your room. Let me transfer your call to 'Micromanaging GM'.

""You need more towels. Please hold while I transfer you to 'Micromanaging GM'.""

""We overbooked, and we need to find you another hotel room. Let me connect you to 'Micromanaging GM'.""

After  watching her do this for a few days, the rest of the staff started  doing this across all shifts. The man would be woken up at 2am to  connect to an angry guest so he was getting almost no sleep with  fielding so many calls. He lasted about six weeks before he resigned.  The hotel's previous GM had to be temporarily transferred back to hold  things together until a new GM could be found. My sister was told by  'Competent GM', that 'Micromanaging GM' had a nervous breakdown, and  'Competent GM' was trying to figure out how it happened in a hotel that  was running like a Swiss watch when she left.

When  'New GM' was finally sent to take over, one of the things 'Competent  GM' said to her was. ""Your success or failure here is going to hinge on  how well you get along with 'Fedral's Sister'.

Edit  1: For those asking why my sister wasn't considered for the GM  position, she was putting herself through college at the time, and to be  a GM in that particular hotel chain required a college degree.",12,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF53D700>
11,Christmas Eve Nightmare,"I worked at a smallish family owned motel right next to a major highway during college.  Holidays were notoriously slow and they usually paid some single staff member (me) double-time plus a steak from the restaurant (attached) to cover those shifts.   
  
So I'm sitting there at about 10 pm in an empty hotel on a Christmas Eve, and it starts to snow.  I mean SNOW.  Quickly the cars start pulling off the highway and pulling in for the night.  I start booking rooms, and more rooms, and more rooms, until suddenly I look up and and I've literally booked the entire hotel in a couple/three hours.  240 rooms by myself.  On paper.  (pre computers).     
  
My boss called a bit after Midnight and asked why there was a line in the parking lot and was I okay.  He had driven by on his way home from a Christmas party.  
  
No problems, boss.  We're all booked up.     
  
I got a bit more than double time that day.  He was a decent boss.",6,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF53D760>
12,Drunks are idiots and dangerous,"I worked at a Well Known Hotel on North Padre Island, like 10 years ago, we had a real fun night. To start off some info on the area it was off season so we had like 5 guests in the rooms, but we did have an outside bar that had a live music, and drink specials so we would get many locals in the bar area. Well this particular night, it was a Thursday so we weren't expecting a to large of crowd but for some reason a local chapter of the Bandidos, a motorcycle gang In Texas, came out to the bar so like 40 bikers and some other locals were out drinking at the bar.

So as people are to do when they drink in excess, some guy started getting mouthy to one bikers and and a fight almost broke out and the local was asked to leave since he was the instigator and im sure the bikers were spending a lot more than the other guy. Well this guy being the drunk he was, went out to his truck, it was like a full cab f-150 style truck so a pretty big truck, he gets in and precedes to drive into this large grouping a parked bikes, pushing some into the building proper right next to where im sitting behind the front desk. So with. large boom and the building shaking and the sound of ringing glass I about jumped out of my skin and run outside just in time to see all these bikers just about having a breakdown because these were their babies that just been destroyed and seeing the truck speed out the parking lot. Than following the truck a couple of the bikers start trying to get their bikes up to chase the guy.

So here I am having to call the police because we have a destroyed Vestibule and building damage. There's these bikes that have been damaged and can't be move like some of the bikes had there wheel braces pushed in and just ruined . So these bikers are pissed off making calls to there buddies to try and catch this guy that just ruined these guys bikes. So we have police come out and we have interviews with them and basically hear these bikers trying to find this guy to and basically put a hit out on him and than like an hour later the police picked up in a tiny town called Odem, Tx. about 40 miles from the beach, and probably saved his life.",15,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF53D7C0>
13,Tales from the Bellman: Election 2012 (Repost with Edit - original removed for names mentioned),"*Apparently, even naming presidential candidates for historical accuracy is still naming names, so I’ve switched to initials.

One of the perks of where I spent the longest stretch of my hospitality career was at the beginning stages of this particular hotel employment, we got to be very friendly with the executive staff. I’m actually still friendly with a few about a decade later, and it was really nice until corporate overlords made changes to property managers, etc., like they always do.

It’s October 2012, and our General Manager (who was the only woman I could recognize approaching just from the sound of her heels) had pulled three of the bellmen aside, myself included.

She asked if we would be interesting in working a shift on a particular day towards the end of the month at our sister location, roughly an hour away, helping the press and staff of a presidential candidate with the initials of M R get checked in, as this was the Presidential race of that year.

If we said yes or no, we had to sign an NDA (very cautionary) and there were background checks that needed to be done and all of that. Gratuity we receive in cash is ours, additional would be added to our checks, with us being there to just oversee the movement of the press and staff into the hotel. I said yes, and then waited for further instructions.

*Before I go too far into it, this is NOT a politics post. Despite anyone’s political cadences, MR was a nice guy and took his time for the press to say hello, but came across as genuine.*

The day of, we’re told M’s arrival time, and to be there five hours prior for security check and to assist the press as needed. We went through pat-downs, metal detectors, all of the things prior to being able to clock-in for the day, but Secret Service was cool and light-hearted, so it put us at ease.

A little bit into the shift is when the buses started to arrive for the press, and if I’m being transparent here, the only crews that were willing to accept our help that weren’t total assholes were WSJ and USA Today. Everyone else had a very stout “Don’t touch my stuff” attitude. But again, we were still getting gratuity for just being there, so no complaints.

Side Note: All of the press, as in every organization, travels together on buses, doesn’t matter what company they’re affiliated with.

After a little while, bomb squad is going through and making a sweep of the lobby. One of the guys comes over to our bell desk, asks if he could poke around, which we of course let him do.

After about two minutes, he picks his head up and asks “You guys don’t have any weapons of mass destruction hiding in here, do you?” which my smart-ass replied “No sir, the scissors are on top.”

He didn’t laugh.

He stared. Uncomfortably. For a while. Through the rest of his search.

Then after he was done, he continued to stare, walked across the lobby to another secret service agent, starts talking to him, and now they’re BOTH staring.

So I think I might be on a list.

Some time passes, and I haven’t actually explored this hotel before. I had passed through the lobby a few times, but hadn’t actually looked around, so since we weren’t doing anything, I decided to explore a bit, check out the ballrooms and whatnot.

Now, not to be crude, but at the time, I had bad gas, so I was essentially walking around in uncrowded areas and crop dusting. 

After my first floor sweep, I move up to the second where the ballrooms are, and agents are posted appropriately (snipers were on distant rooftops, it was pretty unbelievable). I’m still farting away, but honestly just looking around. One agent I think caught whiff, and started to follow me…followed by a second…and finally a third approached me and said “You have to go back to the lobby. We know what you’re doing.”

That stung in a multitude of ways, but I also get it, and I did visit a toilet after.

So after another two hours, MR finally comes in, does the song and dance routine for the cameras, and then checks out our pumpkin carving contest, shakes a few hands, and goes upstairs.

NOT A FULL MINUTE PASSES before I am approached by the same bomb squad guy from earlier in the evening, and he just says “I recommend Imodium for next time. You have a good night.”

A bit anti-climactic, but that’s my Election Week story.",20,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF53D820>
14,"You're going to help me, NOW!","I was working NA and went into an adjacent room to get coffee to switch out. From the desk I hear an (older) man shouting ""EXCUSE ME"" and I reply ""just a second I'm grabbing more coffee I'll be right out!"" Most people are fine with that, takes about 5 seconds. Not this guy, he shouts ""NO. YOU WILL GET OUT HERE AND HELP ME RIGHT NOW!"" I come out and say I'll help you but you need to stop shouting at me. Security overhears and comes over immediately. We are both smaller women, so of course this guy is comfortable yelling at me. He then yells about how someone at the pool stole his shit and we needed to do something about it RIGHT NOW! Security tried to explain that people mistakenly take robes from the pool but almost always bring them to us when they realize it wasn't theirs, and the best we could do for now is document what is missing and hope it is turned in. This is not good enough for him and he continues shouting things about how we better help him right now, fix the problem, etc etc. 

I have told him multiple times at this point that we want to help him but he needs to stop shouting. He has this angry dad-voice like he's scolding children. I keep telling him he needs to stop it because we can ask him to leave.

Security has this twinkle in her eye and says, ""sir, did you see who took your things so we can get a description?""

The light bulb goes off and he says ""well, no...""

Then he opens up his backpack and everything he claimed stolen was right there, on him the entire time.

He puts his head down and covers his face and doesn't apologize so much as he keeps saying he embarrassed himself. That he's going to post about it on Facebook so he can tell everyone what an ass he is. I told him he doesn't need to do that. 

Of course, we basically start ignoring him as he wants to immediately shift his tone to be buddies. Trying to tell us he has a ""funny story"" and we are NOT on the mood. 

He finally walked off defeated, and security told me she's seen this before and we don't have problems with theft, most of the time people just mix up their robes at the pool or they lose it themselves. 

Shes freaking fantastic; I was there shaking and trying to hold my ground since I have my own issues with being screamed at by older men, but she has the strongest and shiniest spine. I could never thank her enough for standing by me for this and making this grown man look like a dumbass.",12,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF53D880>
15,The quickest way to get fired and arrested on the job.,"I went to college in a resort town. My junior year I got a job working at a beach resort hotel, specifically as a bartender.  It was a fairly upscale resort, and rooms went for around 700-1000 USD per night in the summer. In the winter months our rates were pretty cheap and it wasn’t uncommon to see college students and people my age staying at the hotel on a random weekend in January. It was a small hotel and a pretty small staff too, there were as many employees that worked in the restaurant as the actual hotel.  The front desk staff was usually pretty chill as a whole and they would come in after their shifts and drink in the bar.  Looking back, there was tons of drinking on the job and plenty of the kitchen staff was on hard drugs. I have so many stories about this place, but this is the absolute worst.  


It wasn’t  uncommon for the front seat staff and housekeepers to come to the bar and drink for a while after their shifts.  The hotel owner was a legit alcoholic and free drinks in the bar was one of the perks that came with the job.  As an employee, you could drink for several hours and walk out with a bar tab of 20 bucks. 


One night in the winter, a large group of women (bachelorette party probably) was staying in the hotel and they occupied the bar for most of the night.  Our bar staff had a habit of over serving guests that were staying at the hotel. The logic was of course that they weren’t driving, so it wasn’t uncommon for guests to get absolutely shitfaced

One of the front desk staff, a newly hired guy had finished his shift and made his way to the bar around 10pm.  On the weekends we served booze until 2 am so over the course of 4 hours he got a pretty good buzz going. He had spent the better part of the night hitting on one particular women, who against better judgment had reciprocated Interest at one point in the night.  As 2am rolls around, some of the girls had sobered up and were trying to get everyone back to their rooms. One of the ladies had made an effort to separate the front desk employee and the women, realizing that she was very intoxicated and this employee was being creepy.  

We close up the bar and are finishing up closing work. The front desk employee didn’t take very kindly to being separated from this chick and decided to look up her reservation in the computer. Why he was allowed to go behind the front desk was beyond me.  He found out her room number and made a duplicate key to the room and let himself in to HER ROOM. luckily, one of the sober girls was in the room with the drunk lady, because apparently she was projectile vomiting all over the room.  This drunk guy stumbles into her room, only to get pepper sprayed repeatedly. Delirious and drunk, he slips and falls on the puke in the foyer of the room and knocks himself unconscious. Hotel management was alerted and the police were called. All I know is he went to jail that night and was fired.  Never seen him again after that.",65,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF53D8E0>

17,Lady's car gets damaged and has me call the cops only to get arrested herself,"I come in for audit and it is already hectic. There was an ongoing issue with 3 out of hand rooms that luckily I didn't have to deal with personally. It began about 2 hours before I got on and it was dumb enough that my GM was called and was on property when I got there. When I arrived they were wrapping everything up with the police and my GM said ""Since I'm here I might as well sleep here.""

Around 2AM I'm bored and watching the cameras and see a car in our back lot with the rear window smashed. As I attempt to rewind the tapes I hear the lobby doors open and its the guest who owns the car. I tell her I just noticed it and i'll try to found out more. I ask her if she would like to call the police and she said ""no, you do it after you find out more."" She seemed a bit apprehensive and also said she ""probably"" knows who did it. I tell her I'll review the tapes, call the police, and give her a heads up when I do.

I call my GM and he said he'd be down in a few minutes. We watch the tapes and cant determine what room the assailants are in--in fact we don't think they're in a room at all. We had one angle that showed a guy and 2 females walk onto the property directly to the guests car and slash the tires and bust the rear window with a bat. They immediately left the property the same way that they came.

The lady walks back in and says she knows who did it-it's her daughter. We had already called PD and they arrived a few minutes later. The officers request footage and my boss approves that so we're going over the time stamps while the police head to the guests room and begin their investigation.

Later the cops and the lady walk into the lobby and as we're showing them the tapes one of the officers steps aside and has a conversation with dispatch. The mom is going on and on about this and that speculating on whose on the tapes and I hear ""felony"" and the moms voice breaks. I assumed she was crying that her daughter would be charged with a felony and was struggling with pressing charges.

Turns out she was under arrest for distribution, intent, failure to appear/comply, possession, and dui. The officers were trying to be nice as she broke down in our office as they read her the charges several times. She eventually accused the cops of planting evidence ""I know it was you"" and one of the officers said ""I never met you before"" and she said ""yes you did I remember you"".

As she was being cuffed she screamed for a manager and she was going to sue our property for violating her civil rights. My GM said ""Hello Ma'am I'm the manager however there isn't much I can do for you right now."" She said ""you're not the manager I know the manager. My car better be here when I get back otherwise I'll sue."" My manager said ""Is there a tow company you prefer?"" lol.

The cars still back there are the cops do their thing but that shit if definitely getting towed.",10,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF53D9A0>
18,Welcome to Spring Break where the rules don't apply and everyone thinks the front desk is dumber than a bag of rocks.,"Earlier tonight I was helping my PM agent put out some minor fires as I came onto shift. We had a lady get mad because she called the corporate call center and requested adjoining rooms where they told her all our rooms adjoin when they actually don't. When we explained to her that not all rooms adjoin and the ones that do don't fit her room types anyway, so she would have to downgrade to get connecting rooms. She of course thinks we are lying and calls the call center back and explains to them that we are telling her something different than what they told only for them to backtrack and claim they never told her all our rooms connect. She gets pissed takes her two rooms which are still side by side but demands that she move to adjoining rooms tomorrow when availability opens up. As shes leaving the desk she asked if she had checked in sooner would we have been able to get her adjoining rooms, I tell if she had just called us directly and not corporate she would have.

The hotel next door was overbooked and walked a guest to us, they told our PM shift who is still new that they have a direct bill set up with us, they don't. I ask where the walk letter from the other hotel was, they didn't send one. I called them to get an MOP to cover the charges, their manager has it but has left for the night. \*insert eyeroll\*

A man checked in, claiming he booked through 3rd Party USA. We have no record of his reservation at all. He calls them and they refund him, ok great but what about our payment, he can't stay for free because of your screw up, get told sorry and they can't help me. Like really, wtf? Found the fax with the info on it and charge the card they supplied so it eventually worked out.

My favorite one so far was this. A guest used her kid's discount form but clearly altered the form, and when I checked the validation website for the form sure enough it's not even the same names. I call the room to explain this, no answer. So I changed the rate from the employee rate to the rack rate with is literally 3x more, reauthorize their card and carry on. About 10 minutes later I get an angry phone call about why someone's card is being charged, I check the system and sure enough it was the altered form lady. I tell her the form has been clearly altered and the info doesn't match the verification system so I have to change the rate to the rack rate until she can provide a new form and when I changed the rate I did a new authorization amount but did not actually charge her. Admits that her kid no longer works for the company and the form was given to her to use until the expiration date because apparently her kid told her that other hotels don't check the info only if the form is valid or not. She learned we do actually check the info. Now she's pissed off because I won't change the rate back unless she can provide a new employee discount form which she cant.",9,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF53DA00>
19,"UPDATE: I Warned You, Not My Problem!","Update from [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheFrontDesk/comments/t8dmd6/i_warned_you_not_my_problem/) that I forgot to post here.

For anyone who read my last post, you would know that as the guy stormed off, he left his parking ticket. He never actually came back for it, and we tried calling him, but his voice mail box was not set up on the phone number on his reservation or something. After a few days of trying, we stopped calling him.

Anyway, I got a call from one of my co-workers yesterday during my off day. She asked me if there was a parking ticket somewhere behind the front desk as there is an angry man on the line saying that he left a ticket and that I said the hotel will pay for a parking ticket, and now he got two late fee tickets mailed to him since. I tell her someone came in about two or three weeks ago demanding we pay it, but I never said that we would do it, and told her that he did leave his ticket, and the manager has been trying to get ahold of him to no avail. She thanks me and hangs up.

After looking up the town's late fees for a parking ticket, it looks like he got hit with the 7 day late fee and the 30 day late fee.

He better figure out how to get that ticket paid for soon, because after 90 days, he could face some serious troubles in addition to another hefty fine.

Well, I actually drove my co-worker home after her shift since her car was in the shop, so we got to talking about the person. I told her the story again, and she started laughing. The man was straight up screaming at her after we hung up, calling me a liar and what not. She asked him if he is going to be coming back to the area anytime soon or if there was a good place for us to mail it to him. He was at least a couple thousand miles away from us (maybe more, not saying how much so people don't deduce where my hotel is, but y'all get the idea) and won't be back near us for at least a quarter of a year. And apparently, in terms of forwarding addresses, he wouldn't be near his home for a while and has no clue where he'd be staying while on the road. She just gave him the police station's number, which can connect to the parking division and ended the call.

I'll update y'all if/when he returns or another development occurs",7,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF53DA60>
20,Bad Hip My Ass,"So I just had this interaction:  A woman walks in and gives me the name of the reservation to check in.

It's a man's name...her husband's.  I ask if her husband is with her and she indicates that he's in the car.  I inform her that I need him at  the desk with his ID to check in since his name is the only one appearing on the reservation.  She doesn't like this, but turns to leave to go get him...or so I thought.

In the meantime, another couple comes in and I'm checking them in when she returns sans husband.  Once I make it back to her, she hands over his ID.  It goes a little something like this:

Me: Is your husband not going to come in?

Wife:  Er, uh...he's out in the car.  I don't want to make him come in because he has a bad hip and has been walking around the airport all day.

Me:  But he has to come in and come past the desk to get to the room.

Wife:  Well, look...I just want to check in and take him up to the room so that he can rest.  You have the drop-off roped off, so we aren't able to pull in there to take out our luggage.  (What this had to do with him coming in with his ID and checking in, IDK.)

Me: (Internally thinking: It's nearly 1 am, the reservation is under points...this is *not* the hill do die on, so I go ahead and reluctantly check them in.)

Wife:  Where can we park?

Me: Well if you need handicap parking, it's straight ahead.  If not, then you can park anywhere there's a space (duh!).

Wife:  (exasperated) So just anywhere! (Throws up hands and walks out.  I'm not sure what exactly she wanted from me lol.  We don't have valet, and there's nothing indicating that we do....soooooo. WTH?)

I walk to the back office and watch her unload the luggage from our spy cams.  The husband or at least the man who looks like the picture on the ID she showed me, is driving, unloading luggage, and walking around the car just fine.  I watch to see if he takes one of the ADA parking spots.

Nope.

In fact, he takes a parking spot WAY in the back of the lot which requires a lot more walking.  But what about his bad hip, you ask?  I was pondering about the same thing.  Especially when he finally did walk in, perfectly fine, and ask me for brochures on things to do while here in our city.  Yeah...bad hip wants to do some sightseeing while here for one night.  Check out is at 11 am.  What are you going to do between 1 am and 11 am besides pack?  With your bad hip.

These are the same people who vote.

Edit:  Hey y'all.  Not really looking for answers as to why she did this, per se.  I just really wanted to share the frustration that we all face as FDAs/NAs at the front desk, and to let all the non-hoteliers and lurkers who enjoy reading our escapades to *not be these people*.  Just show your ID and have your card ready.  No fuss, no muss.  Park where availability permits, and don't cause any unnecessary waves.  Be safe.",8,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF53DAC0>
21,In All Caps,"Full disclosure I worked front desk security at a hospital, not a hotel, but the mods said it was okay to post here. Also, I do not give permission for this story to be posted or recorded anywhere.

My job was to essentially sit behind plexiglass while wearing full PPE to ask patients and visitors if they had any COVID symptoms or had been out of the country, etcetera, etcetera. For twelve hour shifts. Because it was, you know, a hospital we were trying to keep the body count down because we didn't want to spread COVID (I have so many stories from this job).

Visitors had to be approved and they would be on a list. This list was on an excel sheet that had several categories, name of patient, name of visitor, name of doctor, name of charge nurse, room number, type of visit (single or recurring), date, and comments. This story involves the comment box. See, it was rarely used, usually blank, and if there was a comment it usually wasn't for us. Something the doctor put in there by accident regarding medical stuff we weren't supposed to know, if the visitor was supposed to bring something important to the patient like medical files, and in this rare occasion that a woman was not allowed entry under any circumstances.

Now we begin. It was in the afternoon and this woman, who we will now call EG for entitled grandma, entered the hospital without a mask in to start.

Me: hello, how can I help you today?

EG: I'm here to visit my granddaughter. She's in the NICU.

(Quick note, the actual number of visitors allowed to patients was ONE except for psychiatry, NICU, and palliative care, NICU was only allowed two, while psych and palliative were allowed to approve as many as they deemed necessary but it was rare for psych to approve anyone)

Me: okay, here's a mask, just put that on and tell me your name.

EG: (takes the mask but doesn't put it on) my name is EG Smith (fake name for obvious reasons).

I searched up her name but nothing came up, but names are misspelled constantly so I searched up just her last name and two visitors (neither of whom were her, her son and her DIL) came up. This struck me as odd, because the NICU only allows two visitors and those visitors are always the parents unless there's extenuating circumstances. I scroll over to the comments box because I noticed that Mr. Smith's excel row was bigger than all the others, meaning there was something big typed in somewhere. I get to the comments section and it says, in all caps:

DO NOT ALLOW MR SMITH'S MOTHER EG TO ENTER THE HOSPITAL SHE IS AN ANTIVAXXER, ANTIMASKER, AND HAS REFUSED TO GET HER DTAP AND THE SMITH'S ARE NO CONTACT WITH HER, DO NOT ALLOW ENTRY UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES

I glanced up at her and realized she still hadn't put her mask on. 

*Sigh* 

I already know that I can't bring up the vaccine or mask stuff cause that would just result in a rant I just didn't feel like dealing with, plus she needed to leave anyway so I figured I'd just get her out.

Me: ma'am, I'm sorry but you are not allowed to enter the hospital at this time, please leave the premises and have a nice day.

EG: excuse me? Did you not hear me? I'm here to see my granddaughter!

Me: ma'am, your granddaughter already has two approved visitors and is not allowed any more. I'm sorry but you need to leave.

EG: I will not!

Me: ma'am if you don't leave, I will have to call security and they will physically escort you off of hospital property.

Thankfully a security guard was doing his rounds, heard me say that, and came over to ask if there was a problem. She left (while calling me a c*nt) and I had to send out an email to all desk security her description and that she was not to be allowed in and the guard radioed the details to the hospital dispatch/switchboard. 

She tried to get in through three different entrances and eventually had to be escorted off property by security.

22,Taking away our cordless phone is gonna bite them on the ass.,We have a cordless phone that we use for when we aren't at the front desk and corporate took it away cause one of the managers didn't have the cordless phone on them and when corporate called and couldn't get through cause the front desk phone doesn't ring when it's on cordless mode. Well there are a lot of times When we are not at the desk so I feel like it's cutting off your nose to spite your face. It's just a stupid move too instead of telling us to make sure we keep the phone with us to not miss a call they take away the phone making sure we miss ALL the calls when we have to be away from the desk yes good call corporate.,24,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF53DB80>
23,What's a Blink?,"I work daytimes in a remote independent boutique motel less than 20 rooms, we get a lot of tourists from our nearby historical site, but today was a new one for me. Random non-guest tourist walks up to the front desk asking if there are any electric vehicle chargers nearby for her Tesla. Obviously she's suffering from range anxiety, but doesn't have any idea how her car works. There's nothing that sophisticated here, but we're at 4000ft altitude, and there's really nothing higher that's reachable by Tesla within 50 miles. So I tell her that if she has enough charge to get the 1/4 mile to the descent she'll probably have more range than when she left and should be able to make it to a Blink charging station behind the tourist welcome center. She then tells me that it still uses electricity when moving, and I point out that regenerative charging the descent will pump energy into the batteries she didn't believe that, but then she asked ""What's a blink?"" 

All I could say was it's probably a brand name. I printed her the Google directions that had the address on it for the charging station. ""Good luck!""",15,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF53DBE0>
24,A Series of Unfortunate and Hilarious Events,"First the usual ""excuse formatting etc... This happened last summer and I still get a chuckle when I think about it so I figured I'd tell you guys and gals a story. Also, I'm not a hotel employee but do travel quite a bit and love the stories you guys post here.

&#x200B;

I had a 4 day stay with my 5yrold at one of the schmoliday schminns express near the airport at a medium size city. I checked in later in the evening so I was focused on putting the child to bed which is why I didn't know the in room AC unit wasn't quite functional until the next day. So child and I wake up, get breakfast, then come back to the room to eat then get our day started. I set her at the table with her food and go to turn the AC on and a very loud rattling noise comes out of the unit. I immediately turn it off and call front desk to let them know. Front desk apologizes for the inconvenience and says they will send someone up to fix it, Great! 

&#x200B;

Child and I leave to get done what we came to that city to get done and get back to the room just a few hours later. It's starting to get stuffy in the room because it's the middle of August and it's already mid to high 80's outside. I go to turn on the AC thinking they probably fixed it while we were out and the very loud rattling and now a high pitched whine as well is coming out of the unit, nope... not fixed yet. No problem, they should be by shortly to fix it. So I set the child at the table to eat her lunch and that's when I get the knock at the door, Awesome!

&#x200B;

I let the mechanic/facilities guy in and he sets to fixing the AC. While he wheels his cart of tools in I ask him if he would prefer we leave the room so he has space to work, he says ""you don't need to leave, this will take me less then 5 mins to fix"". Ok then, we'll just continue eating our lunch while you work. So he does his thing and is turning the unit on every now and then to no avail. At this point I look over to see what he's doing and it looks like he's starting to take the unit out of the wall. Now, I will mention this guy looked to be about 80yrs old which honestly wouldn't have mattered at all except he seemed a little frail (looks can be deceiving, I know) and he was trying to take a heavy ass and awkward to carry unit out of the wall by himself and it looked like he was struggling so I asked him if I could help him or call someone to help him and he says ""no need, I'm just pulling it out to look at the back of it"". Ok, cool. I go back to eating lunch.

&#x200B;

The next thing I know there's a huge gust of wind and dust flying ALL OVER the room for about 5 seconds and when the shock wears off I realized what happened. He turned the AC on while it was out of the wall so ALL the exposed drywall and dust that was in the unit and hose part of the AC went directly into the room and all over EVERYTHING including our food. The child starts coughing (yeah, she's quite dramatic sometimes) and I start laughing because we all are covered in drywall and god know what else and it's actually quite a sight to see and this poor guy is just mortified. I tell him ""it's ok, no need to be upset, shit happens"". I throw the rest of our lunch in the garbage and inform the child ""now would be a good time to head to the pool. 

&#x200B;

As I'm getting ready to head out I ask him again if he's sure he doesn't want me to call someone to come help him with the unit and he says ""no need, I'm a very good electrician"". I will note at this point he has the unit opened with guts exposed and I notice he hasn't unplugged it yet. I think to myself ""this could be bad but what do I know, I'm not an electrician"" and at that exact moment I see bright flash and hear a high pitched squeal only to realize a half millisecond later that it was guy getting electrocuted. I see he's still alive and ask him if he's ok and should I call 911 or the front desk. He says ""no need, this happens all the time"". At this point I'm literally questioning how my guy has made it to the ripe old age of however old he is and hasn't accidentally killed himself by now. He informs me he doesn't have a tool he needs and will need to come back later to finish the job. I say ""no worries, we're just gonna be hanging out at the pool and will be back in a couple of hours.

&#x200B;

Child and I go to the pool for a couple hours and when we get back to the room, the AC unit is still sitting on the floor, guy's tool cart is still in the room and dust/crap is still EVERYWHERE. I call front desk to ask ""firstly, is guy gonna be ok?, and secondly, when do we expect the AC unit to be fixed?"" Front desk is confused as to what is going on and says they will send someone up to my room to finish the job. I say ""Ok, cool. I'm gonna head back to the pool but when the AC is done being fixed can you please send housekeeping to the room because, well, they'll see it when they get here"". Front desk says ""absolutely, and again we apologize for the inconvenience"". I say ""No worries, I know shit happens and it hasn't been inconvenient for us, it's just given us an excuse to hang out at the pool a little longer"".

&#x200B;

So as child and I are leaving the room to head back to the pool, we see another facilities guy rolling his tool cart heading to our room. I have a short chat with him as he's also confused as to what's going on, I catch him up and he gets to work, we leave for the pool. By this time it's now early evening and the child is hungry so we stop by the hotel restaurant to grab a bite to eat, (we are still in our wet bathing suits and towels) and I ask the waitress who seats us if it's ok we come in as we are, she has no problem with it so in we go. As she's taking our order the child decides to tell the waitress that she likes her food with no dust please. Waitress gives me a look and I apologize to her and tell her child can be overly dramatic and we're working on manners and how to have appropriate conversations with people. Thankfully waitress is understanding and chuckles (I'm really hoping she didn't go in the back and have a moment because of that comment). We eat, we go to the pool again, we head back to the room.

&#x200B;

I walk in the room and notice there's a brand new AC unit in the wall and it's running, the room is finally nice and cold and then I immediately notice housekeeping definitely came. They made the beds and emptied the trash cans. Yay! we can finally relax...Nope, there's still a half inch layer of crap still settled on EVERYTHING. I slap the bed and sure enough, a puff of dust. At this point it's a little after 8pm and I'm TIRED. I just want to go to bed and while I've been patient and kind to everyone I've talked to all day, I don't have any left. By now I'm sure shifts have changed and I don't even know if housekeeping is on the premises but honestly I don't even care because I don't want to wait for them to change the bedding and wipe down EVERYTHING to be able to sleep in that room. I'm so tired that I even consider for half a millisecond that the tub is the only thing is this room that isn't dusty then snap myself to and walk my very unhappy ass down to the front desk with a cranky child in tow. I muster up as much patience as I can and remind myself (this person has nothing to do with how your day went so be kind). I ask her if I could just be moved to a different room if there's one available, she asks me if something was wrong with my current room and I tell her the story of the day. As I start to tell her, my frustrations just disappeared because we're both realizing how incredibly ridiculous and hilarious it all is and we're both laughing at this point. She gladly moves me to another room and profusely apologizes for the inconvenience  and I tell her ""no worries, shit happens. I know you didn't cause it. I'm honestly worried about my dude who got electrocuted so could you please check to see what happened to him? I'll be here for 3 more days and I would like to know he's ok"". She agrees and we say goodnight.

&#x200B;

Next day I had to do laundry because my suitcase was open when shit went down. I was definitely mostly pissed at that. Rest of the stay went well and everyone was super nice. When I got home and told my partner the story he was mostly amused and definitely worried about my dude that got electrocuted (I never did find out what happened to him and didn't see him for the rest of the trip) and he asked me if we should call the manager to complain. I told him definitely not, (younger me might have because I was an uncultured bitch) the staff did what they could to fix it and it got fixed so nothing to complain about. He agreed and we all moved on with life.",22,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF53DC40>
25,Cops get called and a fight starts in the parking lot.,"So this story happened roughly 10-11 years ago. But I thought you would all enjoy it.

I personally did not experience what happened since I didn't get to work until about an hour after it happened, but I watched the security camera video.

At the time, I was a Front Desk Supervisor at a high end Boutique hotel. One of our main attractions was our SPA.

Early Sunday morning, a couple show up to go to the SPA. Where the clerk there refuses them service because they're clearly still intoxicated from the night before. And apparently the male is high on cocaine (likely).

The players in this story are:

\-Coke Head male (CHM): A particularly large man.

\-Entitled Girlfriend (EG)

\-Duty Manager (DM): Usually the Hotel's acquisitions manager. But every manager took turns to work over the weekend when the rest of management usually was away.

\-Clint: A thing Bellboy and probably one of the funniest guys I've ever met.

\-Guillermo: Another bellboy who was also  either a purple or blue belt in Brazilian Jujutsu.

\-Security Guard 1 (SG1): A bigger guy who usually tried to avoid confrontation and had already proven himself kind of useless before.

\-Security Guard 2 (SG2): A smaller guy, but dependable.

\-Cop 1

\-Cop 2

&#x200B;

With that out of the way. CHM and EG go up to the Front Desk and start bitching at the Front desk clerk. She immediately calls over the Duty Manager to deal with it.

DM shows up to see what's up, and EG starts complaining to him that they were kicked out of the SPA. She then started demanding service because ""Don't you know who my father is!?"", and then telling DM that her dad was Councilman so and so. CHM also chimed in that he was a very famous and important surgeon.

SG1 and SG2 show up and are just observing at this point.

DM stated that he didn't care, they were causing a disturbance and they needed to leave. An argument ensued which I don't remember the details of because this was long ago, and also I'm watching this later without sound and am going from what I was told. But it was basically ""Let us in"" and ""No, you have to leave"".

So eventually as they got more abrasive and refused to leave, the DM tells the front Desk ""If they're not out the door in 30 seconds please call the police"".

EG then pulls out her ID ""See! Look at my last name! I told you Councilman X is my father!"" and then straight up shoved the ID into DM's eyes.

DM tells front desk ""Forget the 30 seconds. Call the police""

Now, this part is pretty crazy, because I've never seen cops show up so fast. We were in a small town and had the number of the local precinct on hand. But these guys arrived within like 1 minute. So maybe the Front desk clerk had called in advance. I don't know.

So before CHM and EG had even reached the edge of the parking lot, a police car shows up and two cops get out. These police cars in this country have a large area in the back for detainees.Pic for reference: [https://c8.alamy.com/zooms/9/be42ce34f3c34343847ad4d4cb0ec98c/e18bc3.jpg](https://c8.alamy.com/zooms/9/be42ce34f3c34343847ad4d4cb0ec98c/e18bc3.jpg)

As you can see from the picture, this happened in Chile. Where we have a huge issue with social classes where the rich and ""high end"" think laws don't apply to them.

So after a very quick back and forth between CHM and Cop 1, where he was informed he was detained. The guy just kind of smacks the cop's hat off his head and starts walking away because he basically thinks ""nah, I'm not under arrest"".

Cop 1, who's much smaller than this towering man, grabs him from behind and tries to put the cuffs on. The entitled girlfriend then goes feral and jumps onto the cop's back and starts scratching the living crap out of him, so cop 2 grabs her and subdues her.

Now CHM is way bigger and stronger than the cop and also supposedly on cocaine. The cop has managed to get him onto the floor on his back, but is struggling and calls for help. This is where everyone gets involved.

The Duty Manager starts struggling to grab the guys feet.

SG2 is grabbing his left arm.

Clint just kind comically starts stomping on the guy's right hand.

Cop 2 is busy holding on to the screeching woman.

SG1 picks up the cop's hat and passively watches the situation unfold.

Guillermo just stands to the side and watches.

&#x200B;

The struggle goes on for what seems to be somewhere between 30 seconds to a minute. And CHM is struggling so hard the cop eventually stands up and tells everyone to back off and let him go.

CHM stands up and looks furiously around like ready to fight or beat up anyone that comes near him.

Guillermo then approaches, looks at the cop and lifts a finger as in ""may I?"".

Now, Guillermo is not big. Maybe like 5'6"", but pretty stocky.

He approaches CHM, the guy reacts and grabs Guillermo by the shirt. And it what seems like a flash, they are both on the floor and Guillermo has him in an arm bar, unable to move.

&#x200B;

He holds him there until they've secured the woman with handcuffs and put her in the back of the van. And then they handcuff the the big guy. And I believe they also secure his feet together. Because they all carry him over like a heavy bag.

At this moment, Clint heads to the van, holds the back door and waves in elegantly for them to literally toss CHM in.",26,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF53DCA0>
26,"""What Reservation?""","It's been a little while, hasn't it? I figured I'd better post something before everyone goes into unicorn withdrawal and have to start snorting glitter or something to get a fix. Buttercup is in the usual spot by the coffee, for those who need some sparkle in their lives right now. 

Tonight we shall speak of the hotel reservation. That ironclad promise that no matter what happens, you shall have a warm and comfy bed to sleep in. You can be totally assured that the hotel will have your room ready and waiting for you when you arrive.

Sorry, couldn't keep a straight face.

Any Deskie worthy of their name tag knows that there are some horrible things that can happen with reservations. Overbookings, wrong dates, wrong location... all manner of foul-ups can occur between the time a guest makes that reservation and getting the keys. 

But it's rare for them to completely *vanish*.

So there I was, relaxing with the knowledge that all my expected arrivals (all two of them) were in, and that after midnight the odds were very low that anyone else would walk in. So of course someone walks in. No worries, perfectly normal, walk-ins happen all the time and - oh, they have a reservation? 

I groan inwardly, realizing I'm probably dealing with the dreaded post-midnight (but pre-audit) reservation. This usually goes one of two ways - either the guest is trying to get two nights for the price of one ""I'm checking in Wednesday, it's Wednesday now."", or they have fallen victim to the quirk of online booking where they can only book for *next* night, since it's after midnight. Sure enough, there's no reservation for 'tonight', so I pull up the reservations for 'tomorrow' night...

... Huh. 

No reservation. Odd... check the cancelled reservations? Nothing. Check by name? Nope. Check the checked-out reservations? (don't laugh, we've had it happen) Nada. There is no reservation. 

I go through the usual checks. Let's see that confirmation email... no, right night, right hotel, right everything. It appears that her reservation has vanished mysteriously into the aether, like a popped soap bubble. I check the OTA extranet and find her reservation on their end, but it somehow never squeezed out to our system. Well, easily fixed, we have the rooms available, just make a new reservation.

Oh, of *course* she prepaid, and doesn't want to be charged twice. Because my life was *easy* before. I check the extranet listing, and ut says it's *not* prepaid, but she swears up and down that she did. After a bit of muffled screaming into a unicorn mane, I convince her to call the OTA, because they have her money, and we do not. Meanwhile, I try to hunt down the elusive reservation, but to no avail. It has vanished mysteriously.

After some time with her arguing on the phone and me scratching my head, the phone rings. It's the OTA, calling about our mutual guest. I explain the situation, and the OTA agent reassures me that the reservation is *not* prepaid. It seems the guest had assumed that giving her card meant it would be. Since I now know that she won't be charged twice, I go ahead and make a shiny new walk-in reservation, get her checked in and up to bed.

Still no idea what happened to the reservation. In the past I've seen where they get the reservation status '[NULL]', and therefore don't show up as 'Pending', 'Cancelled' or 'Checked Out'. But those show up when you search the guest's name. Not this case. 

Anyways, take some time to pet the unicorn and take care of yourselves.

27,"Call another room and demand that I switch with them, on the busiest night of the year when every hotel in the area is sold out.","TL;DR at the end

Being so close to one of the most prestigious and easily the most recognized universities in my state is nice and all, but it has its downsides. Not only is it that every Football weekend and most of the basketball game days are sold out more than a month out, but the university is usually the center for high school state tournaments across a multitude of different sports. This weekend was wrestling, and let me just say, wrestling parents are stereotypically the worst guests.

I came into my 3-11pm shift on the first day of the tournament already mentally and physically prepared for a full eight hours on my feet with no expectation for breaks: four bottles of water ready, three bananas in tow to combat any potential cramps, an easy to eat dinner ordered for 8pm and expectations to eat it at 11pm after my shift, etc. The thing about my hotel is the front desk agent  is usually the only staff member on location after the housekeepers leave, so we are in charge of maintenance, accommodations, custodial work, taking phone calls (internally and externally), emergency housekeeping, etc. If we need managerial approval or assistance for anything and they left for the day, we can call them directly on their personal number if it's an emergency, or leave a note if it can be dealt with in the morning

Because of the state wrestling tournament that was going on, every single room was sold, including our suites (without offering discounted rates, if I may add), so management put in place a rule that we are not to switch anyone’s rooms after they leave the desk initially and not to upgrade any guests' rooms. If it is an absolute emergency or a legitimist reason to switch them, then that’s a bridge we would’ve all crossed if it comes down to it (basically major things like the shower not working, AC unit won't turn on/off, etc., but unless there was a major development like a snake in the room (sidebar: there was one time at our location) where housekeeping/maintenance could not notice it at the time, all rooms were heavily inspected after cleaned and had zero issues).

The last check-in happened at 8pm after the tournament concluded for the day, so for my last three hours, basically all I had to do was deal with internal issues/requests and tell any walk-ins or potential phone reservations we were sold out. I had no major issues for the next two and a half hours, just a lot of mini-mart purchases, taking towels to rooms that needed extra, and tackling the remaining laundry folding. I even got to eat my burger I ordered in one sitting while it was still warm, which was a blessing since usually these events cause me to eat my dinner cold after my shift.

Fast forward to a little before 10:30pm. I'm starting to get my shift pre-wrapped up, seeing how much money I need to drop, making sure I completed all requests and tasks, and making sure I left all the notes I needed to leave for Night Audit when a woman comes down to the desk. I recognized her as someone I checked in at around 4 or 5pm (for sake of context, many hours ago). 

Me: ""How may I help you?""

Her: ""There's a problem with my room. I need a new one.""

Me: ""I'm sorry there's an issue. What seems to be the problem?""

Her: ""Well, I was looking at the chair, and there seems to be a tear on the side of it, my kid spilled shredded cheese on the carpet. Also the lamp is dim and I can hear the neighbor's bathroom fan when I'm in the bathroom."" She starts listing off very petty and easily fixable issues that I can solve in ten minutes top. Nothing that warrants a room change.

I tell her that I can change the light bulb, replace the chair with one that we keep in our back room in case of issues like this, even offer to personally vacuum the cheese (at the cost of another potential complaint for running our very loud vacuum during sleeping hours). The bathroom fan would be an issue no matter what room she is in, and unfortunately something she would need to deal with, especially with a full house like this night.

Her: ""No, I want a new room. One on the second floor."" Ah, so that's possibly the endgame. While it might not be true, requesting something specific like that on our busiest night, especially for petty and easily fixable stuff like she mentioned, usually means there is something else in play. While I cannot prove anything, it seemed she was not happy that she was chosen on the first floor of our two floor hotel (which could’ve been easily changed since a lot of people didn’t check in yet when she came)

Me: ""I'm sorry ma'am. We are sold out for the night and everyone has already checked in. We cannot change your room, but like I said, I'm happy to fix-""

Her: ""Even the expensive suites?""

Me: ""Yes""

Her: ""What about that special room that you employees stay in if the roads close?""

Me: ""I usually sleep on the floor in the storage room if I cannot get home after my shift. We cannot legally put you there.""

At this point she is getting pretty furious.

Her: ""Well, call down to another room and tell them to switch rooms."" The audacity of this woman

Me: ""I am not doing that.""

Her: ""I am not paying $$$ to stay in a room that has that many issues""

Me: ""Again, I'm sorry for the issues. I can come down and fix them. Shouldn't take longer than a few minutes."" 

Pause for breath.

Me: ""I can even talk with a manager and see if we can get you a free upgrade tomorrow night (she was here for two nights and some suites were leaving the next day) for the inconvenience."" In hindsight, I probably shouldn't have offered this to her because it was for petty issues that really didn't warrant a free upgrade, but it was late, I was exhausted, and I wanted to resolve this so I can finish my daunting list of tasks in the remaining fifteen minutes of my shift.

She started screaming, which caught the attention of the other wrestling families that were still in our lobby

""NO! GET ME A NEW ROOM TONIGHT OR I WILL LEAVE AND GIVE THIS HOTEL THE WORST RATING ON EVERY REVIEW SITE!""

I changed my tone from my friendly, accommodating tone to a more stern tone.

Me: ""Ma'am, you are not switching rooms. We do not have any rooms to switch you to tonight, and I offered to fix all the problems in your room, even offering to clean a mess that your child created.""

Her: ""Fine, if you are not going to switch my room, then I am getting a refund and going somewhere else.""

Me: ""If that's what you want, I can check you out tonight. Since you have been checked in for many hours and admitted that you were using the room and spilled food on the floor, we cannot refund you tonight, but you will be refunded for tomorrow night.""

I might as well had insulted her mother with her next reaction, because she went absolutely ape-shit.

Her: ""THIS IS ABSOLUTELY BULLSHIT! I WANT TO SPEAK TO A MANAGER RIGHT NOW! I KNOW YOU AREN'T A MANAGER!""

Me: ""Seeing as it is nearly 11pm and well past business hours, the manager has gone home for the evening. Best I can do is send her a note for her to take care of in the morning.""

Her: ""CALL HER RIGHT F\*\*\*ING NOW AND GIVE ME THE PHONE!""

Me: ""That is not going to happen. You are not getting a refund for the night. You have ten minutes to gather your things from your room and leave, otherwise I will call the police.”

Her: ""HOW DARE YOU! I'M NOT LEAVING UNTIL I GET A REFUND""

I grab my cell phone from the desk and say ""Hey Siri, call [Location] Non-Emergency"" which thankfully caused her to have a realization that I wasn't bluffing about calling the police as she ran back to her room. Thank God it's over.

The lobby actually started clapping after she left, which caused me to smile. One of the guests also approached the desk and handed me a can of cold Coors Light, saying ""You did the right thing. You're going to need this when you are done with your shift."" (which I thanked him for and happily downed when I got home). The problem guest did in fact leave with her kids after ten minutes, but not before happily flipping me the bird and proclaiming that she will go to one of the other five hotels in what I call ""Hotel Row"" as she walked out.

Now, that's not the end of the story.

Because of this incident, I didn't want to leave Night Audit the mountain of sheets to fold, so I stayed back an entire unpaid hour to help them not be overwhelmed when the unthinkable happened: the lady and her kids came back! I was in the laundry room while Night Audit was at the desk, but I saw her on the CCTV we have back there. She looked totally defeated. I stood by the open laundry room door, out of sight from her, but was able to hear everything she said. She tells Night Audit that she checked out of her room earlier, but made a mistake and needs it back. Clearly, she couldn't get a room at any of the other hotels in the area. Shocker.

It wouldn't have been a big deal, even when sold out for the night, since we could just put her back in her old, uncleaned room, but after the spectacle she created earlier, there was no way she was staying here again (when I talked to management the next day, they agreed and added her to our DNR). And especially what she says next, there was no way she was staying here tonight. 

As Night Audit looks for her old reservation to reinstate it, She then kind of bad mouths me saying she left because I wasn’t coming up to her room to fix a few minor issues. Before NA can respond, I walk out of the laundry room to the front desk like I was grabbing something, and her face just went white when she saw me. I tell her that she is not welcome at our property anymore and she is welcome to find another hotel, but kind of warned her that the nearest hotel that I know has vacancies is a half hour away before wishing her ""the best of luck"" and leaving.


Now I do feel bad for the kids as they got roped into the situation and might not get any sleep before they compete (which would give them a disadvantage at state), but at the same time, I tried to be as accommodating as possible. Not my fault their mother is a terrible human being.


TL;DR - Wrestling mother demands a room switch on a sold out night because of minor room issues that I could've easily fixed for her in minutes, caused a huge scene and left the hotel, only to return and get denied her old room when she realized that all the other hotels in the area were sold out as well.


Edit: Fixed some wordings and language as I ironically wrote this while at the front desk, so I was a little distracted. 


Edit 2: I’m going to clarify some things that were questioned and brought up about the second encounter with her at the end:

I think I made it sound more dramatic than it was since it was the end of the story. I apologize if it gave some wrong impressions and reduced some flare from it. All I said to her was because of her unwarranted outburst and unwillingness for me to let me fix the issues, she was not welcome back. I removed the word “sarcastically” from the story when saying there wasn’t a hotel in the area. It really wasn’t sarcastic, I was just exhausted at the time and kind of more of a genuine warning. 

Also, I did tell NA about the lady when they got in, so they were aware of the situation. I came out of the laundry room before NA could see on the computer that the lady in front of her was the lady that was added to our DNR list. 

And the final piece of clarification, she really was not remorseful. She was actually bad mouthing me before she realized I was still there (somehow, I forgot to add that detail to the sorry. Whoops. That’s fixed now)


Edit 3: Since a lot of people are saying I shouldn’t have clocked out for that extra hour, I was on salary at that time and it was near the end of the month. If I stayed clocked in or not, I wasn’t going to be technically paid since I was already going to (and did) meet my minimum required hours without it.",82,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF53DD60>
28,Satan sends one of his own,"I want to start this story by admitting that I made a mistake. Of all the mistakes I've made, this by far ranks among the smallest, but for the seismic fallout unleashed by the guest, one of the ones I have come to regret most. I've decided to share this story because I've just accepted a job at a new hotel.

I arrive to start my shift at 7am as usual. My colleague hands over to me and there's nothing out of the ordinary. One guest has been ordering ridiculous amounts of glasses of water on room service, someone got kicked out for being drunk and disorderly, and lastly there's guest from hell - checking out tomorrow - who doesn't want their room serviced.

As I've always done, I emailed housekeeping to let them know.

""Subject: Room 123, DND

Hi housekeeping!

Room 123 didn't have a DND sign so I thought I'd let you know via email just for good measure""

I'm sure you can see my mistake already, but seeing as it was a pretty big checkout - 120 departures or so - I thought nothing of it. It's a medium-small property with around 150 rooms, so almost the entire property checking out. 

It turns 11am and we're down to around 20 checkouts. Everything had been remarkably smooth, until I see room 123 is ringing.

""Good morning room 123! Reception""

""No it's not a good morning"" booms the answer. ""I SPECIFICALLY ASKED not to be disturbed before 11 and a housekeeper has just come waltzing in. I am absolutely FURIOUS about this"".

Rightly so, I thought. I went to speak to HK and asked them if they had seen my email. ""Of course!"" they said. ""We went and brought up a DND sign just as you asked"". And it was then I realised I had fucked up. We established that it was a miscommunication and my email had been unclear.

Duty manager advised me to own the situation and make as clear as possible to the guest that we recognise the mistake and we would like to fix it.

Phonecall 2: I ring the guest and explain the error that I made. Guest goes into a huge tirade about how her mother has terminal cancer, she's the sole carer, has spent hundreds on this trip away, will never be able to get back the sleep [40 minutes] that she has lost, we owe her money for caring for her mother, for the train, for meals etc etc etc. She came for a relaxing trip away and we've taken it away from her. She may as well check out because she hasn't got the rest that she has paid for, she won't be able to get back to sleep..... 

It was unreal. She ranted at me for nearly 20 minutes at reception. As an apology I offered her an upgrade from a single room to a deluxe double, complimentary breakfast in the morning and a complimentary late checkout at 1pm.

 ""WELL HOW DOES THAT HELP ME?!"" came the reply. I was a bit staggered, because I thought this was more than generous, but I explained once again that we sincerely apologise for the mistake but I was offering her all that I could but she was not satisfied. At this point I asked her what she would like us to do and she said she'd think about it and slammed the phone down.

Phonecall 3, around an hour later:

""I've thought about what I want. Since I didn't get the rest I wanted last night, I'd like an extra night for free. It's going to cost me another £x to pay for a carer to look after my mother for another day, £x to rebook my train ticket and £x in taxis and meals""

""I'm going to speak to the duty manager and ask him if there's anything more that we can do for you, however, realistically, I can almost guarantee that he won't agree to an additional night complimentary. We do take mistakes like this seriously, but I also have to control expectations"". 

""This is appalling, this is disgusting, this is disgraceful. I am going to give you a 1⭐ review on Facebook, on the booking site, on Google, and ALL OVER MY SOCIAL MEDIA. I have been taking minutes on EVERY conversation I've had with you so you had better sort this out or I'm taking it higher. You have a chance to sort this out so you BETTER do what I want or you'll be shooting yourself in the foot"".

""Once again, I'm more than happy to speak to the duty manager about this but I'm simply trying to manage expectations here. You almost certainly won't be getting an extra night free""

At this point I'm seriously considering just asking to kick her out, because she has occupied more of my time than the 120 people checking out combined.

Phonecall 4:

""Hi there, I've spoken with the duty manager and as I expected he's not going to allow you to have an extra night for free. We've made a generous offer of an expensive upgrade, free breakfast and a free late checkout. We think this is more than reasonable compensation""

""Well in that case, if you aren't going to offer me an extra night, then the least you can do is offer me a free meal in the restaurant. I can clearly see on your menu that it's £x, and compared to the distress you have caused me while I'm having my FIRST BREAK IN THREE YEARS FROM CARING FOR MY TERMINALLY ILL MOTHER, that's not a lot of money at all"".

""Ok as I've said, I'm more than happy to speak to the duty manager but he isn't going to offer you that either""

This time I spoke to the duty manager and I said right she's getting on my fucking nerves, you talk to her.

I really had had enough of her by this point, so I decided to be spiteful and make her wait before giving her the upgraded room. I got all the paper work out and decided I was gonna use the time organising it to cool off, otherwise I was going to spit in her face.

She comes down to reception, flings her coat on the chair, flings her room cards at me and says ""I'm here for my new room""

I said ""I've got you a room just a couple of doors down so it's not too far to move your things. Would you like us to come up and help you move or would you like me to just give you the key?"".

""Well if I had known one of you was going to help me then I wouldn't have brought all my stuff down would I?!?!"" *Gestures to her bags*

So I gave her the key to the new room. She storms back to the lift in the manner of a toddler who has just been denied sweeties in the supermarket. Scarcely had I had the chance to go cuss her in the back office before she rings (phonecall 5) from the new room to complain the coffee machine isn't working. I explained how to use it, but she was too dim so I sent a housekeeping supervisor up to show her. 

This was my last interaction with her, so I finished up my shift and left. I was absolutely seething after dealing with this demon guest all day. I went shopping to take my mind off it, but I finally understood the expression ""seeing red"". I was looking at stuff in the shops but it was like I couldn't see anything through the rage I was feeling. 

I came back in the following morning and heard all of my colleagues' stories about her behaviour after I left. She sent back her main twice in the restaurant, got a free dessert which she also sent back, Whispered threateningly in one of the waiter's ear, stolen a load of jam jars/chocolate spread/pastries at breakfast.......to top it all off she went and ranted at the morning FD team for not giving her - yes really - a 7am wake-up call 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 luckily they knew she was taking the piss because they knew full well that this all started from her losing out on 40 minutes of sleep and that she had accepted a late checkout as compensation.

At this point, I did something that is probably *highly* unprofessional. I decided to go look for her on social media and she had left all of her posts public. And it was VERY enlightening. Very very very enlightening. Included were the following:

- A picture of the chef (we have an open kitchen) handling the food with a caption along the lines of ""naughty boy touching my food, I love a freebie 😉""

-A picture of the hospitality tray before and after she had asked every receptionist and housekeeper for extra teabags, milk, coffee and sugar all piled up high. 

-A post just after she had gotten off the phone with me saying something like ""he's just offered me a deluxe upgrade, I wonder what else I can get""

-A racist comment about one of our housekeepers

-A post showing how she stole a pair of shoes from a budget high street retailer ☠️

I sent all of the screenshots of her posts to the GM. Of course she leaves us a terrible review but I'm sure she wasn't prepared for GM's response. I nearly threw my phone across the room in shock when I saw that he called her out for being a racist, screaming at staff to get free stuff and stealing shoes ☠️

It was the ultimate microphone drop moment when he proceeded to thank for providing a real life example of some of the most diabolical behaviour any of us had ever witnessed from a guest, before apologising to the team on her behalf 😂

I don't know if it was clear but this is singlehandedly the worst person I have ever dealt with in all my years in customer service. And I think what angered me most was using a terminally ill relative to try and get free stuff. 

Thank you for your time if you made it all the way to the end.

29,“Unionized hotels” not giving lunch breaks?,"Hello everyone, 

I currently work at a chain hotel on the weekends and normally all managers are out per usual but I don’t get a lunch break at all. I stay behind that desk for 8 straight hours with some bathroom breaks but for the most part I HAVE to stay behind there until the end of my shift. This caused me to get burned out during a shift because I can’t find the 5 minutes in my shift to shove food down my mouth so I can survive. I applied to a different hotel chain and they told me that they’re a unionized hotel which essentially means that their lunch breaks are paid for. In California at least, I know that all employees MUST take a break before their 5th hour regardless of the working environment. From the way the HR coordinator described it, if someone works 8-5 they don’t have to stay the extra 30 minutes to make up their lunch break. This is a very odd predicament for me as I’ve ALWAYS had a lunch break if I work more than 6 hours (5 is the law but companies can get around that). Anyone else experience this at least in California?? I used to work Friday-Sunday but with the lack of breaks I get burned out before Saturday shift even starts.",40,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF53DE20>
30,Where is the food?,"Not sure if this is sad or comical but last night one of those meal delivery drivers came in around 8 and dropped an order outside a guest room door. The thing is that it was on a section that was closed for a couple of days due to work being done to upgrade the tv system. Our security found it and from the ticket deduced it was the right room but the wrong hotel. She called the property it was supposed to go to but their desk could not have been any more rude. I heard it myself. She left at 10 and took the dinner home with her. It was from a rather upscale Greek restaurant. About half an hour after she left this guy comes in. He went to where he dropped the food off. I was getting ready to leave and he comes to the desk asking if anyone ""found"" any food. I didn't want to deal with this and asked what he meant. He said never mind and left. I know that order was $63. Our security and her husband had a nice dinner.

32,Looking for advice,"
**edit- thank you all for your advice! turns out the new hire is very close friends with our AGM- another reason I got knocked off the board. your comments have opened another eye for me, & now i will be searching for other option. Take care now, all of you :)


Obligatory on mobile, delete if not allowed, any names/places have been changed to remain anonymous.


Roughly 4 months ago I applied to be Front Office Supervisor at my hotel. Upon applying, I was informed that the person in HR that reviews the applications, was out on personal leave for an extended period of time. I told them that’s no problem, I understand life happens. My GM assured me though that he thought I’d be an excellent fit for the position, I would be fairly interviewed, & they would not hire someone from under me. The franchisee I work for also BOASTS about “promoting from within” rather than bringing in new people. 

Fast forward to 2 months later, our regional director comes in for a meeting. I bring up my application. He told me he thinks I’d be great for the position & would like to move forward with it & somebody will be reaching out to me to schedule an interview. 

3 weeks ago, my GM sat me down, told me he no longer thought I was fit for the position & wouldn’t offer an explanation as to why. I asked my AGM, if there was a situation that came to light that kinda booted me from that position, but she told me no- someone else was hired for supervisor, and she technically was not supposed to be telling me. She did mention that something was “in the works for me”, but it’s a social media manager position & I am not interested in the slightest bit. 

I feel like I should also mention that even though I am not qualified for supervisor, they have me training her for the next week. 

Do I pack my shit & go elsewhere? I put everything I have into making sure my guests are happy & comfortable here. I know practically everyone that comes in & out of this facility, & most of all I know it like the back of my hand. 

I feel incredibly discouraged, any advice is appreciated.",33,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF53DF40>
33,Naked dude amok,"One morning after my audit shift was extended an hour by my relief running late I get a report of a naked dude on the second floor.  I immediately run to the elevator and the doors open up to a fully naked dude.  He gets off the elevator and immediately punches out the glass on the fire extinguisher case.

He runs down the hall to the lobby making strange sounds the whole way.  (Hut hut hut). While in the lobby he starts throwing pillows around and then tears a sign off the door and runs outside.

In the parking lot he tears something off a truck and starts opening car doors at random (I later find my car door open and a bunch of flowers on the seat). He runs over to the bank at the front of our lot and tries to get inside.

At this point myself and the dude who owns the car rental place in our lobby are outside watching him.  I return inside to take care of guests.  I later learn he ran out into traffic and is laying down in the road and jumping on cars.  He is finally picked up by cops.

34,The Art of Pantomime… Or Adventures in Teaching Guests on How to Read a Fucking Sign.,"So, I work night audit at a hotel and from the hours of midnight to 6 am, our front doors automatically lock. More or less because there are crazy assholes who have robbed Night Audit clerks at machete-point. Being one of those people who doesn’t like to be at machete-point, I support this rare policy management has put in place to limit those occurrences. The only way to get back into the building is to use a hotel key card (or, alternatively, have someone else open the door for you - but I’m sure as shit not going to do that unless I have a good reason to).

We have a sign on the door. It has a picture and it describes what you should do. But, it has a fatal flaw. In order to work, a sign must be read. And the problem with guests is that [they won’t read](https://youtu.be/qslcnw-9KbI). So, they invariably ring the doorbell and choose to stand outside in -10 or -20 degree weather instead of, y’know, reading a fucking sign. 

I’ve taken to pantomime. I start acting out the actions they need to do to let themselves into the building. When I hear the doorbell, I grab a blank key card from the pile and a picture of the keycard reader and then, I start tapping my key card to the part of the picture that reflects where they should tap their keycards. Then, they start looking for the reader, as it’s not directly right next to the door but it’s close. And while I try to point at it, they never get the point because usually, they’re standing in the way of the reader.

I could paint a neon-green arrow to the keycard reader from the sign and I swear, I doubt anyone would read the damned thing. Having knowledge of UI/UX design and the depths of human stupidity can be depressing sometimes. This happens every night.",29,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF53E040>
35,It's free,"Did you know that you can just walk into any hotel and help yourself to the continental breakfast?  You don't even have to book a room, just dig right in!  


I'm getting ahead of myself.  Last night I was working the night audit at a Duper 9.  Things are pretty quiet until about 2am, when I notice a guy walk down the hall from the direction of the rooms, and over to the little table near our front desk where guests can help themselves to coffee and tea.  Given that he didn't come through the main doors to my left, I think nothing of it, dude's obviously a guest.  


But then I notice that he's wearing a pretty roughed up looking backpack.  I realize that I don't recognize this guy (we're mostly oil industry workers atm) and that backpack makes me think he might be a homeless guy that I just missed somehow.  I'm not really about to make a big stink over a cup of coffee though, so I don't confront him yet.  I do watch him on the cameras though.  


So, picture a long hallway.  Just beyond the front desk is a big area for our pool, and directly adjacent is the breakfast room.  It used to be our dining room for our in-house restaurant, so it's a decent size with a second level with additional tables and chairs. The breakfast room is walled off and kept locked (outside of breakfast hours), but the walls only extend to the second level of the dining room.  Said second level has no wall, and looks freely out over the hallway towards the pool.  I hope that's a good enough description.  


Anyways, I'm watching the cameras and I see this guy go around past our vending machines into a little blind spot next to the wall of the breakfast room.  I sigh, and head over there to gently shoo him out.  When I get there, I don't see a guy trying to sleep in a dark corner of the hotel.  Oh no.  Instead, I see him literally climbing up a wooden log support to the second floor of the dining room, thereby bypassing the locked door!  


This is a first, even for me.  When I (pretty brusquely) confront him and ask him just what in the hell he thinks he's doing, he tells me that he wanted to go look for some creamers.  Instead of y'know, asking me for some, this dude decides to scale a fucking wall into a locked area and just take some.  When I tell him to get down, he decides that means he can go down into the breakfast room and help himself to our food.  


He just starts grabbing shit, and when I confront him about it, his tone is what sticks with me the most.  He never sounded angry or upset, he just spoke like this was an ordinary thing he was allowed to do.  He was hungry, so he got some food.  The door was locked, so he climbed over the wall.    


I do manage to get him out of the breakfast room and out of the hotel, and do a security check to make sure all my doors are locked.  Unfortunately, it seems like out of our outside side doors doesn't latch.  You should need a keycard to get in, but this door doesn't latch so you can just enter whenever you want sans keycard.  That explains why I never saw him come in.  Awesome.    


Things are quiet for a while, until around 6:30am when I'm refilling some breakfast items, when low and behold, it's this fucker again fixing himself a bowl of cereal.  At first I don't believe my goddamn eyes, and I almost respect the sheer balls on this guy.  I ask him just what the hell he think he's doing back here, he's blacklisted from the property (it was my first time seeing him, but I got a hold of the other Night Auditor and she knew exactly who I was talking about), and so on.  He just tells me in the same matter of fact monotone, that he's getting some more food.  I repeat, what makes you think you can just come in here off the street and take it?  


""It's free.""  


Fucking what?  I honestly don't know if its mental illness or sheer bravado at this point, but his defense is that hotels just lay out free food for everyone to come take.    


I kinda start to lose my cool at bit at this guy, some harsh words are exchanged, and so on.  Eventually he leaves, and literally sits right outside the side door eating his cereal and looking in.  I think he's already been served a trespassing notice, and while I called the cops before he left I'm not sure if they managed to find him or not.  I hope so, I'll be damned if I'm going to spend all of my next shift trying to play security for a bunch of bagels and yogurt cups.",18,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF53E0A0>
36,"""Eviction"" by cop","The story about the mother slapping a police officer reminded me of something. So here it is.

I love it when unruly guests remove themselves through ""eviction by cop"". It is always very very entertaining.

A few years ago, I had a 25 person bachelor party at the FD checking in when my NA shift began. They were VERY drunk, the groom itself had already passed out on a couch. They were rowdy and tried to be flirty with the girl who was checking them in and she was having none of it. But she waited until they paid there 1800€ for the weekend (we were not a top tier property, hotel/hostel combination and the had booked a few dormitories). Then she told them:

""Ok, you are checked in, here are your keys, just FYI, we have a strict one warning policy in regards to misbehaving guests and he (points to me) is the guy who will kick you out when (she actually used ""when"") you act up, disturb other guests or are rude to the personel. Have a nice stay.""

That gave them a little pause and they grabbed their luggage and made it to their rooms via the stairs. The door to the stairwell had not closed fully yet when I heard one of the brainiacs YELL so loudly you would have been able to hear it on every floor: 

""I can't believe the stupid bitch talked to us that way""
(way ruder in German)

So I sighed, printed out their room list, grabbed the master key and proceeded to evict them room by room. Took me about 30 minutes and by then end of it they had somehow reorganized, imbibed some more liquid courage and thought it was a good idea to challenge me and to threaten everything from physical violence to legal action.

So I called the police, told them I had an angry mob here threatening me (easily recognizable through the phone). The first car arrived 2 minutes later, followed by a whole contingent of our ""Bereitschaftspolizei"" (the guys in riot gear).

It was quite the sight, let me tell you. And the face of the GM the next morning was priceless. She saw my face when she came in and immediately asked: 

""What have you done? You look too pleased with yourself""",85,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF53E100>
37,How the hell are you a parent???!!!,"just a note to add: obviously looking back i should have just gone for it and called them, but mind you this was the first time ive ever dealt with this, and it happened 4-5 months ago-so i guess i was unsure of myself at the time to make the call. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Old Story, but a classic none the less...if you wanna call it that. So couple of months ago this mother and her two daughters checked in (once again ventura county CA for refrence). kids seemed a little bratty and mom was pretty white trash, but didnt think much of it...

&#x200B;

after they got checked in, about an hour later one of her ""freinds"" showed up to hang out with her (her freind had drug dealer vibes) so they go up to the room for a little, and maybe about 45 minutes later i see her and her freind leave on the camera. based on this im assuming the kids are asleep or the older kid is keeping an eye on the younger one while they wait. (mind you younger one was literally still in diapers) so i see them leave the room, dont think anything of it.

&#x200B;

about 15 minutes later, something catches my eye on the camera. i literally see this infant toddler runnning up and down the 3rd floor, trying to open every single room door yelling ""mama! mama!"" so i go up there and i go ""hey buddy are you ok???"" (of course this terrified him) and i was like ""your momma just went to say bye to her freind she will be right back ok, lets just go wait in the room buddy ok?"" so i got him to go into the room but as i was closing the door he started SCREAMING, and rightfully so. so i was like fuck it, i RAN downstairs and i saw the mom leaving her freinds car and i was like ""hey you seriously need to come get your kid, hes running up and down the 3rd floor screaming for you"" and she goes ""ohh....ok im on my way"" (proceeds to go into her car to grab/ put back who knows what than just takes her sweet time walking back into the lobby. LIKE WTF IS WRONG WITH YOU??? SERIOUSLY?? I TELL YOU YOUR CHILD IS POTENTIALLY IN DANGER AND YOU TAKE YOUR SWEET TIME????

it just astounds me the ammount of people that have children that should NOT. and i get that every parent needs a break....but come on man, what kind of mother are you??-straight up was ready to call CPS as cruel as the whole process is, but man....the front desk are not your babysitters.

38,Jinxing myself on a sold out night,"Just a rant from Saturday night. 

I walked in we were sold out and all the rooms were checked in. I told 2nd shift it should be an quiet, easy night.  That was the jinx.

2nd shifts pass on was that in 2 rooms the heaters weren't working,  the maintenance man couldn't do anything with them, the units were dead and needed to be replaced. 

2 other rooms had issues with tvs, the maintenance man couldn't fix those issues either.  

Then sheets needed to be washed and folded, but there were none pulled to wash. Housekeeping said they needed queen fitted but it was all mixed in the laundry bags. (I washed 2 bags and called it a night, if the correct items weren't pulled, they get whatever is washed.)

Then 2nd shift leaves.

1st room with the heater issue comes and asks for a discount. I give her $40 off the rate which was really high for some reason.  It put the rate down to our normal rack rate. She was happy and left.

2nd heater room came with an extremely grumpy old man.  He begins yelling at me about how the maintenance man said he was coming with a space heater and why hadn't he gotten it yet. I told him I just started working and was catching up on everything.  That I had been there for 20 minutes and apologized.  He said he had loud neighbors for hours and showed me a video of them talking loudly. Nothing had been said to 2nd shift.  I went and talked to the neighbors,  they said they were going to bed. I hunted down the space heater and gave it to the guest.  I didn't hear from him again. 

I called my boss to find out how she wanted me to handle the other guests and how much to discount their stay.  As I'm talking to her, one of our contracted guests, who are truck drivers, come in. They have rooms every night, but for some reason they had no reservations for Saturday.  I had to tell him we did not have a room for him or the 2 other drivers that were supposed to come in.  I found the logbook,  1st shift called the company at 1149 am and they told her we had no guests. So she released the rooms reserved for them for Saturday.  My boss is freaking out asking me why there weren't reservations for the drivers, all I could tell her was what I read in the logbook.  She looks at our email and find that they they had 3 guests requested at 8 am, but 1st shift wasn't able to get into the email to see this. And when 1st shift called the company they said there were no drivers/guests.  

I give the driver a list of local hotels to call to look for rooms, their dispatch is looking for rooms. I'm calling sister properties looking for rooms. I find three rooms after asking the clerk to verify how many rooms he had by using my boss's name because he kept saying he thought he had 2 rooms, he wasn't willing to get up to look, after using my boss's name he looked and found out he had 3. I ask him to please hold them for me.  I talk to the driver, dispatch had just found them rooms an hour away.  He leaves. I call the sister property to release the rooms.

Then beyond washing and folding for several hours, it was a long night of answering the phone and telling people we were sold out and had no rooms.  Several came in and said they had just spoken to me and I said we had rooms. The number found online goes to central reservations and half the time they don't double check to see if we have rooms available for immediate check in, they just look at what is available the next day for check in, so they tell the guest we have rooms available. I had a lot of pissed off people walk out the door after telling them they didn't talk to me and we had no rooms.

Luckily by the time I ended my shift I didn't hear from the TV rooms, they were 3rd party reservations and we couldn't offer a discount.  I also didn't hear from either of the heater rooms again.  Nothing was passed on from 1st  shift on Sunday morning, so I don't know if she had any issues from those 4 rooms.

I'm never saying it is going to be a quiet night.  That is just asking for trouble.  I know better,  but it slipped out and I totally jinxed myself.",11,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF53E1C0>
39,Why do the brats always come on my night???,"So where I work, we see few children. Generally a good thing. (I think a child fee is needed way more than a pet one.)


Moving on, Spring Break is here. And honestly I have never been more happy to not have to go in for a few days. I am NA. Love my job and have been so at different hotels for over 20 years. Though last night kinda takes it for me. 


Sitting in my car, before I am due to go in had grabbed a pizza, so munching on it. When I see not 1, not 2 but 5 teenagers using a grocery cart to ride down hill in. This would not be so bad if there were not near every car in the back lot, and about to fall over. 

I am not on duty yet, so I wait. Straightaway after walking in, I ask my coworker if there have been any complaints, etc. He says other than a few car alarms going off, nope. 

He leaves, after I go back down to check on the back lot. The teens in question have just ran into what was a nice undented f150. I ask the teenagers to stop. Was told that their mom and dad said they could do whatever they wanted as they were paying for 3 rooms.  Asked what 3 rooms. They did not answer. Asked where the parents were. No answer. By now I needed to get back to the front desk.  Also sick of playing games. 

Once back at FD, I call the local PD. They arrive, I explain where to find the teenagers, and that I need the room numbers due to witnessing them damaging another guests vehicle. 

Officer brings 4 back. The 5th has went to the restraunt/bar next door to get their parents. 


Wonderful. We get the parents stumbling up the stairs and down the stairs searching for their sperm throphies. As they are rather drunk, this is an entertaining sight. 

Finally they make it to the FD. To see the officer telling the teenagers to sit down and not move. 


Loudest scream I have heard ever, come from the mom. 
""How dare you have my babies here, out of bed! What is the meaning of this?""

By now they have been in my lobby for about 30 minutes. Her babies have been nothing short of hood rats. The manner they spoke to both me and the officer could make a salor blush. 

Me: Your children have been causing problems related to damaging another guests property.

Mom: My babies did no such thing. They need to get their sleep. 

At this point she tries to get them to go with her. 

Officer: They can go back to the rooms, and not come back out, unless you all want to be removed. 

Mom: Slaps officer. 

Nope no warning just does it. Even her Hubby looks shocked. 


Needless to say, they were removed from the hotel. Mom was arrested. Dad took kids to another hotel. From what I understood they only had one room left, and for each person beyond 4 there is a $20 charge. Added to Rack rate, because well, the other hotel is full? That means with bail his wife cost him well over $1000 more. 

Wonder what stories the other hotel will have? Because here all the desk clerks talk to each other.


UPDATE:

The FDM called me last night at home. He said that it took him over an hour to stop shaking his head and going WTF? To himself. 
So far the moms charges are:
Contributing to the delinquency of a juvenile (appears one ""baby"" had gotten into the stash of booze),
Assault of an officer,
Battery of an officer,
Resisting arrest,
Destruction of property ( 2 of the 3 hotel room were damaged, one was missing a door to the bathroom)

The owner of the F150 has decided he wants his $, from the mom. So he will be bringing her to court, if she and hubby do not pay for the repairs.  As there were more than one car damaged, poor 1st shift spent the day helping with reports. 
That we have video feed all over the hotel, and caught them on it, does help. 


I am sure there will be more. Her hubby is currently at another hotel in town. He was told he can not leave until CPS interviews all the ""babies"" to see if this is ongoing or a one time thing. (the underage drinking)

And as a bonus, I had blacklisted them from our hotel, but my FDM sent a memo to all the others around us in detail about what had happen. Wonder how the one hubby and sperm trophies are in now is going to handle them? 

I will update again after I return to work later this week.",48,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF53E220>
40,"Update: Entitlement, neglect, and property damage","I promised an update, so here it is!

The man from 206 came down today and went off on my husband because they had to leave by 11 am. Kept asking us where he was supposed to house his kids. That is obviously not our problem. We have them so many resources! Churches, missions, shelters, relief aid. They claimed no one could help, which is bs. 206 goes back upstairs and H decides to walk our dog. Our big, scary pit bull named Hades. So I'm alone with just the cats and my 4 year old, who is autistic. 206 comes back and wants garbage bags. So while I'm getting them, he's bitching about how people pretended to help them when they really weren't and how it was two faced. Meanwhile I'm trying not to punch him out.

H comes back and then 206 comes back. They start screaming at each other in the parking lot. So I call the cops and apparently so does 206. In the 3 minutes it takes them to get there, 206 and the rest of them are walking away and ISG is downstairs with H. They went to go talk to them, 4 cars deep. Then came back, didn't say shit, and left. It was weird. But we got the go ahead to go into the room and y'all, I WISH I could show you what it looks like. It is BAD. If I can figure out a way, I'll put them on my profile.

41,Best day ever!!!!!,"Ok, this might be one of the most satisfying moments of my hospitality career.  We had a piece of human garbage stay with us for multiple one night reservations over the last month.  Let’s establish he was a super shiny ( heavy emphasis on was)Every time he stayed with us he would yell, threaten and stare down the male agents and try to goad us into fights.  The female agents would be yelled at and told how incompetent they were.  Well he decided to threaten and start something with me, due to the fact I could not issue him a key without him having proper ID ( it was in his room ).  I offered to have security let him in and verify his ID.  He proceeded to threaten me by saying he would email corporate ( oh please sir, don’t do that…..lol ).  He then tried mad dogging me as he was walking away ( hilarious, could have destroyed him without trying, not worth losing my job).  After the piece of trash left, I looked at all his reservations and talked to my managers about not allowing him to come back due to his history of harassment.  They agreed and were already taking the steps to make this happen.  Well guess who won the pony, this piece of shit booked another reservation and tried to check in with me yesterday.  I immediately called him over and informed him I would be right back.  My amazing manager proceeded to inform him that he no longer can stay at our hotel and that his super shiny status was revoked as of a week ago.  He was escorted out by security.  Best day of my career, having to deal with super shiny pieces of human filth and to finally be able to help get one permanently banned from our property and their precious status revoked……FUCKING AMAZING.  Extra points as I got to look him in the eye and smile the entire time.",37,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF53E2E0>
42,Oh no you’re not getting your way,"So a story about my last day working in a hotel. So for context the hotel I used to work at doesn’t take in walk-in guests. Some company bought us out and we only take those guest and they have to be on the list. To stop walk ins from getting in we built a gate and have someone who works for that company that has a list. Most guest come in through the buses from the airport, meaning people not on the list gets in that way. Usually they’re understanding. I can write stories on when they’re not, like this one. Onto the story.

A male walks at 10:55pm. My night audit has also just walked in ready to start his shift. For the most part my day has been simple, a few of the people complained bc of things literally outside of my control. For the most part I was just tired and ready to go the fuck home. As I being nice I worked from 7am to 11pm.

The guy shall be named K and I’m me.

K rude as hell: give me a room.

Me being nice: I would love to help you with that sir, do you have a reservation with us?

K: no.

He said those magical words. With a fake sad voice. Me: unfortunately sir we are fully booked.

I say this to them because I hate having to explain how a company bought us out. They like to know who the company is and asks sooo many questions. So I just say we’re fully booked, which isn’t really a lie. The rooms maybe empty, like this particular day, but my computer says otherwise.

He walks away and I think oh good I can leave, but nope it was false hope. He comes back.

K: how the fuck are y’all full, the parking lot is empty.

Before the contract happened I’ve always hated when ppl pulled this statement thinking they caught us. Not only that but I was done with him when he cussed at me. I shut down and my nice customer service voices goes away but my I’ll talk to you like a child because you’re acting like one voices comes on.

Me with my I’m about to go off on you smile. I also kept my voice very professional: sir do you really think that ppl drove into this hotel? I noticed how you didn’t drive to get here. Have you actually considered that since we’re next to the airport that they couldn’t, I don’t know, take the shuttle to get in here. And why would I lie to you about us being full? I get paid if we’re empty or full. Now since you’ve used a bad word I’m going to ask you kindly to leave.

K looking as if he deserves the world handled to him: I am a blank member.

Me: that’s wonderful and will work at our sister property. I really don’t like repeating myself. Please leave.

Because entitlement runs in his veins he starts going on about it being late and he just gotten in and just needs a place to stay, very rudely with bad words into the mix. I actually stopped listening as I picked up the phone and dialed the cops. I haven’t had to do this at this job before, but hell. He’s now trespassing. He’s not happy that I’m not listening and starts screaming at me to listen and things while also adding bad words. The cop on the other end hears this and informs me they’re on their way.

My night audit is trying to calm him down asking him to leave while I’m talking to the cops and telling the guy that I have in fact called the cops on him.

I should mention that me and my night audit are black people and K is white. Night audit is a guy and I’m a chick. I bring this up because for some reason this is important to him. This would be the second time working at this job that I’ve been accused of being racist, but this time by the opposite race.

He’s realizing that none of this is working in his favor and tries a new tactic. He tries to explain his life story in a nice way. It’s after my shift and like I mentioned it was my last day.

Me in a very condescending voice: that sounds like a you problem and if you don’t leave the cops will arrest you for trespassing 

The look of shock he gave me was well worth it. K: I will leave a negative review.” 

Me because I stopped giving a shit very sarcastically: oh no a person threatens me with a good time.

My night audit couldn’t hold in the laughter. He still refuses to leave and decides to have a protest of this in the lobby. I stay to make sure my night audit is safe and I want to know how the story ends. The cops show up, he isn’t arrested. Not surprised, they very rarely are. He’s told to leave or he will be arrested and that’s when he decides to leave reminding us that he’s going to leave a bad review.

He did leave a negative review and my manager called me about it and I told him how rude he was being and how I refuse to take negativity from people. Hearing from night audit manager isn’t mad about it. The video also showed him cussing and apparently threatening us, so my manager got rid of the bad review bc ya know, you can’t always get what you want.",13,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF53E340>
43,I got to witness 3rd party Karma,"Anyone who's worked front desk in a hotel for more than a few days will quickly come to despise the 3rd party booking platforms. 

Last night, I had a gentleman come to check in shortly before midnight. He booked through a 3rd party (sorry, can't hint at it because it would give away too much info). Apparently he and a colleague had booked at the same time as he showed me the email he had received confirming the 2 rooms .

Well, the colleague's reservation came through, and that person was already checked in, but this gentleman's had not. He called the booking partner and tried for several minutes to get the agent to give him the hotel confirmation # so we could try looking it up. Finally after putting this person on hold for a few minutes, the agent gets back on the line and says  ""for some unknown reason, your room was cancelled by the 3rd party booking agency.""

The Karma? - The gentleman is a VP with this 3rd party company. Seriously, after he quickly re-booked through his companies website (literally got it done at 11:59pm, right before the midnight online rollover) I got him checked in then checked out his LinkedIn profile. He is a VP with the 3rd party booker that can't explain to him why they up and cancelled his reservation.

Right before he told me he worked for them I was about to say ""You know, this doesn't happen when you book directly through the hotel's website.""",90,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF53E3A0>
44,No I do not have any rooms available,"To preface, I've been told we do not have rooms to sell after midnight. We can make reservations up until midnight but my GM does not want us to make anymore after. That being said, all of our clean rooms are reserved for tonight, I genuinely do not have any rooms to sell, even though the house isn't full. ANYTIME I get a call to ask if I have rooms available I tell them no.

Well American Airlines didn't call, had a cancelled flight and placed everyone in hotels, right? Wrong. They placed everyone but ONE person at another hotel under our umbrella, and of course they send me the abroad living, international travelling, American born Karen, and she immediately comes in bitching to me about her day like its my fault.

Of course she doesn't have a reservation and I don't have a clean room to sell her.

For all intents and purposes I'll be me, obviously, and she will be FAK. To clarify, FAK stands for Foreign but American Karen.

Me: ""I'm really sorry, but I don't have any rooms available tonight.""

FAK: ""Of course you don't, why would you? Are you sure?""

Me: ""I am sure, I'm really sorry. I wish they had called to confirm so you could have just been placed at a hotel with rooms to begin with.""

FAK: ""So you don't have anything?""

Me: ""No, I do not have any rooms to sell.""

FAK: ""Even if I was paying?""

Me: ""Unfortunately not.""

FAK: *raising her voice* ""I am a Shmilton's member!""

Me: ""I'm really sorry, but I do not have a room.""

FAK: *raising voice further* ""I have been waiting in line for **TWO** hours, this is where they sent me, this is ridiculous, why can't you just do your job.""

Me: *raising my voice just a little higher, finally snapping after two solid minutes going in the same circles and being yelled at my whole career* ""Ma'am, I do ***NOT*** have a room tonight! It doesn't change if you were paying, It doesn't change if you personally slide me $1,000 under the table, I ***DO. NOT. HAVE. A. ROOM. FOR. YOU!***  If they had called me, like they were supposed to, I would have told them as such!""

FAK: *normal tone -le gasp-* ""Well! You don't have to yell, I'm a customer!""

Me: *actually bitch, you don't have a reservation so you're not* ""Well unfortunately I do not have a room.""

She proceeds to bitch about how since she doesn't live in this country anymore, she doesn't have a phone, so even though I'm ***DONE*** she hasn't done anything to warrant a trespass, I just want her to be gone, so I called one of the other hotels in our umbrella they were being sent to, begged for a room, was told this one is the ONLY one (totally get it), ordered a taxi and sent her miserable ass on her way. Funny how she had a phone she could make calls on as soon as I started desperately calling taxis.

She stared at me the whole time, glared as I checked in a room that was reserved, then huffed when I said her ride was here

45,Volatile Guest,"A new night a new incident report. Except this time I get to cry and shake in the locked back with a taser. 

""A guest tried to break into the back room then went behind the FD before I could get to the door to tell him to back up. He charged at me with his alarm clock and I held up my hands to keep him back. Apparently a previous guest set an alarm up and it woke him. I could not get his name or room number. He asked for a refund. Do not refund. DO add him to DNR when you find out who he was. He scared me. I ended up shaking and crying in the back writing this. I did grab the taser after. Please, we need security. I thought he was going to hit me. I had to tell him to stop coming at me. ""

I watched him storm out of the stairwell on the cameras. He went straight for the backroom. Did not go to the FD. I thought he was going to damage our systems or wreck things. I made the mistake of not grabbing the taser as soon as I clocked on.

We really need security here. We get a lot of unstable people wandering around in the lot and a lot of dangerous and unstable people staying here. We're also the nicest hotel in the immediate area.

46,Fun Times,"Due to new circumstances my place of work has lost a lot of heads of departments - don’t worry, they are fine, just found better opportunities - one such head just so happens to be the Executive Chef. His timing could not have been more hilarious and had it not been for the pure panic that set in.

On the other front, since certain restrictions are no longer being applicable - we had a nice swarm of people come in to our restaurant. Naturally, it was understaffed for the amount of people who turned up, so I had the pleasure of playing host whilst keeping up with my usual duties. 

However, I’m not complaining. Playing ‘host’ by all accounts is something I enjoy; I guess it has something to do with yours truly being a ‘people pleaser’ or perhaps the fact that interaction between people sometimes gives you memorable moments that can be shared on a subreddit. Or maybe it’s both. 

Now, the aforementioned Chef, had decided to not change the menu - which I suppose is fair, since he is leaving. But, people have finally gotten a chance to get some sort of normalcy back - or whatever the new normal is - so it did sadden me a bit when they asked if there’s anything special and all I could do was apologize. 

I was on the 6th pair of seating people when a twosome, an old couple, asked if there was anything special. Now, I didn’t want to be greeted by disappointment. So, I took a chance. I told him he was, he was the special. His eyes lit up, like child’s in candy store and he laughed. Apologized when I told him it was the same old menu, but he didn’t care at the point, he was still beaming at being “the special”. I excused myself and went to the next pair. I could still hear the old pair giggling in the back. 

As the night progressed, a group of 6 walked in. 3 out of the 6 were definitely having the time of their lives. The other 3, well, they didn’t seem the type you should joke with. No biggie. 

Whilst I was at the opposite end of the table assisting one of the sullen folks, the cheerful gentleman across from me asked me the same old dreaded question “anything special?”. Remembering the last reaction, I perked up and without giving it a second thought told him “he was”. 

Our sullen person, looked at me dead in the eyes with the utmost confusion and told me “oh no, he meant on the menu”. 

I swear, the table went silent and the gentleman who asked, burst out laughing and told me he sees what I did there and he loves it.

I quietly and quickly backed off the table and told through heaps of laughter relayed the whole interaction to one of by fellow workers. 

I feel lucky to be able to post again in such a short period of time and more than that I feel grateful that the interactions I have had so far have been nothing less than wholesome, hilarious and positive. Fun times.",6,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF53E4C0>
47,ooooo now THIS WAS FUN!!,"work at a inn in southern california, ventura county. story isnt too crazy as ive dealt with worse being that our clientel is either super rich or sketchy homeless/near homeless people trying to pull fast ones. Yet this still pissed me off and rightfully so.

&#x200B;

I Get a Call from a number and do my usual ""thank you for calling the ------- beach this is ------ how can i help you today?""

""hi do you have any rooms available?""

&#x200B;

""sure do, let me see what specifically is available..ok we have 4 rooms left, queen rooms, meaning 2 queen beds in each room and it is going for 164.18 after tax""

&#x200B;

""oh ok, what floor is it on?""

&#x200B;

""at the moment it doesnt give me an indication as to which floor and room number specifically, i would have to make the reservation first, then i can see which are available""

&#x200B;

\*proceeds to ask me 3 more times the same question and i keep giving the same reply while they eventually try to talk over me (because  thats what immature people do when they arent getting their way, right?)

&#x200B;

after going back and forth one more time the boyfreind or husband/whoever tf takes the phone and says ""fuck you in your ass for not telling us which floor"" i proceed to get upset and say ""EXCUSE ME?!"" and of course the big strong tough guy just hangs up. Like man if your gonna talk like that you better prepare to back that up and not act like a lil bitch when you dont get your way. Although, his threat was PRETTY sus, so maybe he has some confusing feelings he needs to work out:) end rant",25,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF53E520>
48,"Entitlement, neglect, and property damage","Okay, so this is a doozy. In case you didn't read my last post:

My name is Allie. I am the GM of a small mom and pop style motel in a shitty county in Florida. My husband and I officially took over 3/1/22. And it's been hell ever since.

We had our first official new guests on 3/2. I had 2 rooms ready, and 1 room that needed cleaning. I'm gonna use room numbers to make this simple. So here's the cast:

Me- obv me
H- my husband
ISG- impromptu security guard, the one who does the yelling for me, cuz I'm less than 3 weeks from birthing
106- chill, kinda alcoholic dude
109- geriatric lady that became completely reliant on H and constantly soiled herself
206- young couple with 2 children under 3

So to set the stage, it's between 8 and 9 at night. It's fucking COLD. Like, 40s or 50s cold. I close my office at 8, but sometimes I'm nice and let people come in later. I need to stop, cuz that's what gets me in trouble. I get 3 phone calls. First, H calls me. He wants to put a person in 109, because she was here when we lived here and needed a place to go. She had been sleeping in her car for a month, because the housing I found for her ended up falling through. 109 is the room she always stayed in, so that was fine. Second call comes from a young dude. He says he's on his way, and is waiting on the bus. My motel is first come first serve, and I tell him that. Third call comes and it's another guy. He's right up the road and wants a room. I tell him FCFS and he says he's coming. So now I got 3 people, 2 rooms. The old lady is already here, and her spot was already secured from the get go.

My bell rings. It's a guy that just got off work. I do my registration/check-in process. Take his money, hand him his key, and that is that. He's 106. I get ready to close. Doorbell rings. It's a young man with his gf and 2 small kids. ISG is there and turns them away, because we're full. I didn't know dude had kids until they turn to leave. I scramble to figure out what to do. H is picking up a Walmart order for me and is busy. I send ISG out to stop the couple before they get too far away. H pulls in and starts helping 109 get into her room. I'm freaking out, ISG is freaking out. I tell H to go clean our last room super quick. It needed a deep clean, which usually takes 2-3 hours. Plus the last person in the room was a prostitute who flushed used condoms down the toilet, so it broke.

H cleans this room in maybe 10 minutes and fixes the toilet to be usable. It's now like 10 pm. He's ready to kill me. The couple goes through registration/check-in and are ready to go. One of my tenants, 108, came in while they were doing the paperwork and told them that they had mashed potatoes, meatloaf, milk, and soda waiting for them in their room. So they go up and that's that. And yes, H forgave me cuz he knows I couldn't see children sleeping on the streets.

So a few days later, my bell rings and one of our long term residents tells me her ceiling is leaking again, which happened when the prostitute was there. We get a bucket and some towels and it's taken care of. Few more days and it happens again, but this time it's a steady flow. Both times, H told 206 not to get water on the floor. They say okay, and then don't listen. This is also coupled with the daily complaints from everyone next to and below them. Kids screaming and banging all hours of the night. It was literal hell. Half of the motel wanted to kill them.

So, fast-forward to 2 days ago. H walkies me on the phone and says I need to come to 105 right away. I was laying down cuz I had had a doctor's appointment that morning for a NST and blood work and crap. Needless to say I was pissed at having to get up. So I walk out to 105 and look in the doorway. There is a huge chunk of ceiling missing and water EVERYWHERE. 206 flooded their bathroom again and it was enough that the ceiling gave way. Luckily H had just finished cleaning 108, who had moved out and was actually 105s mom. So we move 105, who is 2 girls that work as CNAs and a little boy, to 108. We close off 105 for the night cuz we don't have the supplies to fix it yet. Next day comes and we try to get supplies. It's slow-going as we have to depend on my step mom for a ride to Home Depot. I can't leave the office alone and H is legally blind and can't drive. By the time we get some supplies, it's late. But H still goes in and does what he can. He cuts out the rotted drywall and gets everything cleaned out and puts up a sheet of drywall to close it up for the night.

H goes in today and the sheet of drywall is on the floor. 206 is so heavy footed that the tacked in piece was knocked loose. H cleans it up and starts getting ready to get it properly installed. All while he is trying to fix it, 206 is running around above him. He comes in to vent to me and he is COVERED in drywall dust, water, sweat, and gunk. They were so bad upstairs that it knocked all this shit down on his head. So I walkied ISG and she went to tell them to go to the park or something for awhile, so H could work. They get downstairs and somehow words are exchanged between 206 and ISG. H rings my bell and I come out to 206 and ISG screaming at each other on the sidewalk. Theyre paid up until tomorrow and I am NOT renewing. They wanted to stay here for months.

The guy from 206 has been constantly bothering me. Today he rang my bell while I was on ""lunch break"" (I was trying to nap cuz everything is swollen). He wanted to buy a cigarette. I don't smoke! There were literally 5 people outside smoking and he thought it was a good idea to come to the office while it was CLOSED to buy a cigarette. 0 brains. His girl also slandered us on fb the other day because we're ""too expensive"" and we're kicking them out because if her ""autistic"" children. Which, if you read everything above, is obviously not the case. She's been begging for food and money on fb for like a week. That leads to the 2 other parts of the title.

The most notable instances are 3/14 and 3/18. It was in the 50s/60s here on 3/14, with a wind chill that made it feel in the 40s. My son came home from Grandma's wearing a wool sweatshirt and sweatpants, with a fuzzy lined jacket on. That's how cold it was. The 206 woman takes these 2 small kids outside to walk god knows where. All they have on is flip flops/sandals and a diaper. I almost froze looking at them. 3/18 the little girl, who's maybe 1 or 1.5, runs out of their room and down the stairs while her parents are nowhere to be seen. All she's wearing is a diaper.

You can hear 206 screaming at their screaming kids all the time. The mom admitted to giving them melatonin and Benadryl to make them sleep. They cant feed them, or clothe them. Even though she bathes them constantly, somehow they're still covered in dirt. Neither of the kids can talk whatsoever. They think that because they're homeless and have kids that they're entitled to a room here. And they're not. They've made enemies of people that have lived here for a decade or more. Which is another issue. We can no longer have guests for more than 28 days in a 60 day period. I get to keep my few long termers, which is nice cuz they're great. One of them is ISG and her husband, while another one just installed a new security system for us. I have 1 that's already moved out and another leaving at the end of the month. So I have 2 spots for long term. I'm not filling them with 206.

So basically my almost month long headache will be gone tomorrow. Hopefully I won't have to call the cops. Maybe things will be quieter. I'll update tomorrow 😂",22,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF53E580>
49,I'm Straight Up Going to Have to Quit.,"I don't really know where to begin, y'all. This hotel is going to absolute shit. I commented on someone else's post about this situation not too long back, but I think it's officially reached a cacophonous crescendo... at least I pray this is as bad as it gets.

A few months back, our washing machine went out. Obviously, it isn't like we could magically make a new one appear in a day, so the situation required a band-aid solution. The thing about a temporary solution is that it is meant to be used for a short time before a more permanent solution is found. You wouldn't drive on a spare tire for months, and expect for everything to go well, right?

My boss doesn't think like that though. Luckily, my boss also owns the hotel next door. So the temporary fix was easy enough, we were just taking the laundry next door, and doing it there. Some mysterious part was ordered... but it just never seemed to come, and when it did... suddenly we needed another new part.

Our maintenance guy confided in me... well, me and anyone who would listen, that over the years, he's spent more on spare parts for the washing machine than the thing is even worth. He'd apparently begged our boss to just bite the bullet, and get a new one. I imagine he got pretty much the same response I got, ""Oh, you have $17,000 laying around?""

I wanted so badly to say, ""No, but according to the PPP website, you got a forgivable $93,000 loan just last year. Did all of that go to your son's mustang, or was it more evenly split with the cost of the renovations to your house?"" 

So, cut to today... months into our ""temporary"" fix. Who wants to guess what happens when you more than double the burden on an even older washing machine for 4-6 months?

Yep, after my two days off, I come in to piles upon piles of dirty laundry in the back. I was so hopeful, and just assumed our laundry guy just pulled yet another no call no show. 

That was not the case. My coworker came in the back, absolutely frazzled, trying to hide from our housekeeper, who is shouting his name from the other end of the hallway. I looked at him, and pointed to the piles of unwashed laundry, and he nodded. ""So... what happened today?""

""Well, yesterday the laundry machine stopped working,"" and at this point I'm working under the assumption that he's talking about our laundry machine.

""Oh, so it started working again?""

""Oh, no, I'm talking about the one next door.""

Fuck me.

""I had to pull all of the sheets, and towels from the 3rd floor rooms. I'm not kidding you when I say it's all going to smell like mold. Everything is stained. I put a pillow case in a room that looked like it had a mustard stain on it,"" for context the 3rd floor has been almost entirely shut down since the start of the pandemic. My boss apparently was kind enough to stop by, and tell them to ""make it work"" to clean two floors with only the linens from the 3rd floor. Apparently some of the linens weren't even changed if they ""looked okay"".

Y'all... this is supposed to be a nice hotel. 

Maintenance was apparently just now able to ""fix"" the washing machine next door. That said, we were also warned that the machine may catch on fire, because of the way he had to go about fixing it. So, our boss called in one of our housekeepers to get the bulk of the laundry done before tomorrow. 

Usually Sunday nights are chill, and relaxing, but I'm preparing myself to be cussed out... a lot.

I can't work like this. This situation is in no way fucking tenable. Even if we ignore the inevitable guest complaints, there's the problem of worker morale. My front desk coworker was visibly shaken, and I'm pretty sure that one of our housekeepers was about to break down in tears. The HK supervisor is just about done with this shit too.

And the situation is still developing! The housekeeper sent to get a head start on the laundry just came back to let us know that the laundry machine was not in fact fixed. So, she might have to somehow pile the linens in her car, and take them to a laundromat. I'm sorry, but that's just janky as hell for a hotel to have to do.

Still developing. I called my boss to let her know that we were told it was still not working, and got into a back and forth with her, but I guess HK is going to attempt to get started.

All this said... If nothing else, I have a college degree, and maybe this is the push I need to find literally anything else to do.

Hearsay UPDATE:

This place is a hopeless rumor mill, so I'm taking this with a grain of salt. The HK, here after her shift to go use the fire hazard laundry machine next door just told me that my boss actually has a new commercial laundry machine... at her house. This seems a bit far fetched even for her. The only reason I'm giving it any credibility is that she's kind of known for doing stuff like that. Her mansion is partially built using spare parts from the hotel construction, and when our refrigerator gave out, she bought a new one, put that one in her house, and gave her old refrigerator to the hotel. This housekeeper has actually been to her house, so who knows.

UPDATE II:

Well, hotel comrades... The end of my shift is nigh upon us. So, far, it's safe to say that a miracle has occurred... given there are three more minutes, and then however many minutes late my relief decides to show up, left. That said, and I'll once again knock on wood, somehow there have been no major complaints about the rooms. All I've had to do was fix an AC, and switch a TV to the correct HDMI setting (and the guy gave me a $4 tip... just to correct something that shouldn't have been a problem, which is always a bit wild). There were a couple of guests disappointed that they couldn't get extra towels. 

I was fully prepared for tonight to be a complete disaster. That said, not so far! The housekeeper who came by was able to wash to bins full of laundry... though she didn't put them in the dryer... I don't know what the full logic behind that was.

Anyway, last thing for now... a super shiny (nice one though) just pointed out that our elevator inspection certificate is expired.",66,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF53E5E0>
50,I was absolutely LOVING all our guests this weekend UNTIL....,"Cast of Characters: Me! (Me), Irresponsible Spring Break Mother (ISBM) who was staying in the next room.

(Why are high-schoolers going ANYWHERE for spring break? Is this a new thing? Am I just old and crochety??? Anyhooo...)

ISBM: Can you come to room 17? The floor is all wet! My daughter's stuff is all wet!

Me: Oh my gosh! I'm so sorry!

*I run back to the room and there certainly is a puddle of water all over the floor. YIKES! I start searching. Where did it come from? As I approach the mini-fridge--*

ISBM: I used all the towels from both our rooms and I wiped it up as best I could but it got all over my daughter's bags and clothes!

Me: I really apologize. I'm not sure what would have caused it to defrost like this--

ISBM: Well my daughter unplugged it two days ago so she could charge her devices!

*Hhhhmmmm...maybe that was it! The unplugging!!!!*

Me: Well, ma'am, she should have used the charging station on the bedside table with **four USB ports and two plugs**, or at least chosen to unplug the microwave or the coffee maker before she UNPLUGGED THE REFRIGERATOR. So sorry her stuff got wet. I'll bring you some fresh towels!

I'm gonna go do a shot of Jameson and a load of towels! LOL",30,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF53E640>
51,Do you guys get hit on more as FDAs than other jobs?,"I’ve noticed that in this specific industry I seem to get hit on more than any of my other jobs. I’ve worked other jobs all in customer service but have never experienced it to this degree. I’m a pretty average looking guy but still get flirted with semi-often- while my female coworkers are borderline harassed. 

I’m in a relationship so I always ignore them and if that doesn’t work I just tell them I have a GF which definitely stops them. I’m sure the experience is different for women.

For the most part it’s pretty tame - I’ve had a couple guys and girls try to get my number. 

I’ve also had an 80 year old woman tell my coworker that she didn’t want to check-in with her cause she wanted to try her shot with a young guy like me which I thought was hilarious. 

However tonight was my most aggressive experience as this drunk lady tried to start dancing with me in the lobby. I just walked by and ignored her. But later she forgot her key and the front door was locked. The control is at the other desk so I just walk up to the door to open it instead- as I’m walking she looks directly at me and starts shaking her boobs. I just open it and walk away but I was pretty shocked and realized in other industries I’ve never had people be so direct with me lol.

Was curious if other peoples experience was similar? Also I do night audit at a property near bars which I think probably make things worse lmao.",29,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF53E6A0>
52,Auditors are not housekeepers.,"Hey y'all. I'm back a couple years later (left the hospitality industry but came back to get through school). To the vent.

I work for a decent 3-star hotel and with it being spring break, it's understandably busy. I struggle with not being frustrated when everyone is so needy though, never saying please or thank you for towels/washcloths/other amenities, coming in without reservations expecting rooms to just be available and then getting mad at me when they're not, repeatedly ringing the phone for one thing at a time instead of asking all at once, not watching their kids who call the police and hang up (which automatically triggers a response from the local PD).

Tonight sucked because the lukewarm (and this is putting it nicely) PM shift decided he wasn't going to check the features of an accessible room before switching someone into it. Issue is, to make the room more maneuverable for someone who's in a chair or has a walker, the pull-out couch comes out and a smaller chair is placed inside instead. Double rooms still have 2 queens. However, normal doubles also come with the couch so you can sleep 6, not 4. Two people booked standard doubles and rather than saying anything between 3 and 11, shift before me just slaps them in accessible rooms and calls it a night. 

The one lady comes in with 5 other people from a long car ride and was excited to get to bed, but she came back downstairs in complete panic that she wasn't in the right room (thankfully she didn't let anyone unpack or get in the beds). I had just walked into the place and gotten logged in so I didn't really get the issue until I looked. I had to scramble and find a dirty room to clean so they could get some sleep, but thankfully there was one standard double left so I switched them into that one. However, the other person was still an issue- he came with 4 people (so 5 total), and he said the same thing upon checking in, that he was ""missing"" a sofa (in a room type that was never going to have one). 

Now I really was out of options at this point and night audit was over halfway through, and I still haven't done any auditing whatsoever. Internally I was panicking and simultaneously pissed that it's always me having to fix everyone else's mistakes while they get to sleep at night. I don't have any housekeeping help at 4:00 am. I shouldn't be stripping down queen beds, scrubbing toilets, clearing shower drains of hair and dumping trash when I'm supposed to be here to check people in and out. I get paid no extra for this and no one asks housekeeping to do front desk work. They run a skeleton crew of housekeepers, get surprised when they quit because they're exhausted, then look at FD to pick up the slack (and there's only 4 of us for this 24/7 position. It fucking sucks. They won't hire any more help, claiming they're not getting applications. Right.). I'm the youngest on staff and yet I end up doing the most. 

These people didn't get to go to bed until 5:00 am despite checking in at 3:20 after a long flight delay so I told them they could use a late checkout even though they weren't members, to recoup some sleep. They were some of the nicest guests even though they had every right to be annoyed at an inconvenience of this magnitude. Hoping some good karma comes their way.",23,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF53E700>
53,One of our best long term stays did something stupid and got evicted (arrested).,"A mom and her two kids have been staying with us for about almost a month now and so far she’s been respectable, no noise complaints or anything like that. She’s always helpful with her linens and cleaning and has been overall a great guest. Sometimes she’ll bring us food at the desk which we appreciate especially if it’s busy and we hardly have a chance to sit down. 

I arrive for audit and my coworker said “Omg, guess what Nice Guest did?” I thought maybe she made us a nice pot roast or something. Apparently she got into it with another guest over what we don’t know. Right around shift change at 3pm one of the clerks said “wtf isn’t that?” And it was nice guest crouched down behind her car with a wine bottle that didn’t contain wine. She darted from behind her car in stealth mode to the guests car that she got into it with earlier.

My coworkers ran outside and the maintenance man arrived first and saw her dart out from behind that car into a waiting get-away car laughing. They noticed the guests gas tank door was open and an unknown liquid seeping out onto the pavement. 

The guest who owned the car heard the commotion and came out understandably upset. My FOM rewound the tape and it clearly showed the Nice Guest emptying what turned out to be sugar water into the other guests gas tank. It showed the get-away car drive around the property and nice guest jumping out literally right in front of the office crouching down as if someone no one would see her. She fist pumped and waved her arms in triumph before bounding into the get away car.

The police were called and staked out the property until nice guest returned and tried to chat with the desk as if nothing happened and she was apprehended there. Luckily her kids were already with relatives by that time. Apparently she has relatives in town but she isn’t staying with them makes you wondering how people really are even if they seem nice.",62,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF53E760>
54,"This may not mean much to anyone else, but... Personal Best!","I posted this earlier, but it got auto-nuked for being too short, so I guess I'll have to ramble a bit. I've been at my current 197-rm. property for almost 8 years, and my standing record for Most Check-Ins In A Single Day was 95. Until about 20 minutes ago - fuckin' shattered it with an even 100! Goddamn, it's been a long day. I still have, like, 3 reservations due to arrive before I call in and trigger the roll-over.

I'd like to thank the night auditor who called out sick, thus virtually requiring me to cover since (A) I'm the FD Supervisor, (B) I was here all day doing B-shift anyway, and (C) I loves me that sweet, sweet overtime pay

UPDATE: Okay, I wasn't even able to post this before I got called away and added two more walk-ins to the tally, LOL. Almost made it 3, but after a long trial & error, we couldn't get this woman's Google Pay to work because, as it turns out, her phone doesn't even have NFC capability. Womp womp.

55,Fired for not being “transparent enough”.,"Last month I had just started working as a medical office assistant/front desk. It was a very small office with just 3 MOA’s (including myself) and two doctors but only one doctor would work at a time. 

I already didn’t like the person who was training me. She would get very upset and embarrass me in front of patients. For example, I would make a small mistake such as not pressing the check in button and she would say “you can’t be doing these mistakes anymore” in a very threatening way. It was my second day. Or another time, she was helping me check out a patient and she told me “I’m not your secretary” I laughed it off because I thought she was joking but she was serious and was mad at me for being “too slow.”  I hadn’t asked for her help. She had just decided to help me. She was very rude and demeaning.

Before I got hired they made me sign a form where it stated I couldn’t write any reviews about them anywhere while working there or after, so I will not be disclosing where this is even though I want to tell everyone not to go there because it is truly awful there. 

While working there I was applying for other part time work because they were only giving me 4 hours shifts and I only had 3-4 shifts a week. I also did want to quit as soon as I could. The optometrist found out that I had been applying to other clinics because the clinic I had applied to told him. I guess they were friends? He brought me into his office and told me I had to be transparent towards him and I tried to explain to him that I wasn’t making enough money and that I needed more hours. He told me he would revisit the hours and wage in 3 months time. 

The problem was I couldn’t wait 3 months for him to increase my hours. I kept looking for work and didn’t apply to anymore optometrist clinics. Two weeks after he had that conversation with me he pulled me and my other coworker into the room and fired me because I was not “transparent enough”. I almost laughed because how dumb that reason is. I was still in the probation period, so he could fire me without any excuse. That is the dumbest reason to fire someone over. It is none of his business if I’m looking for work elsewhere. I’m also not sure why he pulled my coworker in with us, I found that strange.",20,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF53E820>
56,Worst. Chessmaster. Ever.,"Had a guy come to the desk just now and ask for a key to a room. No preamble and the room was actually one of ours - none of that hyper-suspicious ""I'm in room 996!"" shit, you know? I ask for his ID to verify the name, he goes out and gets it, and it's not a match. There's only one name on the room, so I call the phone number on file. Guest sounds like he was asleep and, sure enough, he has no idea who the hell this dude is. I hang up, hand the dude back his ID, and tell him he needs to vacate the property immediately.

Now, the weird part is that he actually did. Zero fuss whatsoever, LOL... just took his ID and left. And it's got me wondering, ""What the fuck was even that dude's endgame?"" I could tell from the jump that he likely didn't actually know anyone here, but what if the guest in the room had vouched for him and I gave him the key? Jesus, I hope I never get so desperate for a room that I'm that nonchalant about rolling those dice.

UPDATE: Well, fuck me sideways...just had a guest call down from a room that's one floor off from the number the man in question gave. Guest told me, ""Yeah, that's my kennel partner **(they're here for a dog show)**. I fell asleep and he's been blowing my phone up for an hour.""

57,It’s the hotel fault that I didn’t lock my “tesla” and got my bags stolen.,"It happened just an hour ago. A guest checked in and wanted to valet with the hotel. Sure no problem. Told her to park in front of the hotel and hand us the keys and we will have the valet come over from the garage to park it for her.

When the valet guy came to pick up the car, he saw a man closed the car’s door and take 2 bags away. He wasn’t sure if that was the car he was supposed to pick up, so he didn’t stop the man from walking away. When my agent confirmed with the valet that is the car he supposed to pick up, he told us that somebody walked away with 2 bags. 

We immediately called her room to make sure there wasn’t any left behind luggage or bags in the car and asked if the door was locked. She said she didn’t lock the door and thought the front desk / valet should be the one taking care of it. I mean its common sense to lock your door if you have expensive bags in the car. It was confirmed that those 2 bags the man walked away, was indeed hers. 

She was furious and asked what will the hotel gonna do anything about it. There’s nothing that we can do beside looking at the camera to see what really happened. Why yell at the front desk if its your fault for not locking your door? We cant baby sit everything.

P.S: we do not have a garage that is connected to the hotel, so we’re using 3rd party garage which is couple buildings away. How it works is the guest park in front of our hotel lock it up and hand us the key. The valet will come over from the garage to pick up the keys then bring the car to the garage.",36,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF53E8E0>
58,UPDATE: I dare you to commit fraud!,"Original post is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheFrontDesk/comments/thttty/i_dare_you_to_commit_fraud/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

Alright guys… time to spill the tea! Sorry u/Poldaran, no tasers were involved. 

So… I just happened to be at the desk when my dear friend Sally arrived, alone and without the mom this time. I go through all of the steps, welcome her back and have a polite chat with her while I also go over the details of her stay. All is going well and she was being quite pleasant. 

Now it’s time for her to provide a card for incidentals. As she is placing her card into the reader I take the opportunity to let her know that I know on a round about way by saying 

“Ms. Fraudulent, I’m not sure if you recall but, I gave you a call a few months ago in regards to the gift certificates that you purchased during your last stay. The charge was reported to us as fraudulent and we never received funds for those. Unfortunately (for you) that means they are not valid. I never heard back from you so I’m guessing you were able to sort it out with your bank?”

She froze. Didn’t say anything for a few seconds and then just looked up and me with a puzzled look and says “oh I don’t remember that. How strange. I suppose it was handled then.”

This is where I hand her ID back and her hand is straight up shaking. I’ve clearly rattled her and caught her off guard. She checks in and gets settled in her room. I leave the desk to the agents and think to myself “damn… Reddit is not going to be happy”

About an hour later the FOM comes to talk to me in the back office. She tells me that not too long after I left the desk, Sally returned asking for a manager OTHER THAN ME. She then demands to be told exactly what we know and the FOM gave it to her straight and called her a fraud in the nicest way possible. She did not appreciate our honesty. She starts to go on about how she’s lived here for Yadda yadda years and is important within the community how dare we etc etc. (she’s a middle school administrator). Then she went on to say the FOM was just as worthless as the husband she is divorcing and is here to get away from. The FOM asked her to calm down or return to her room and that would not tolerate her unnecessary outburst here in the lobby. She protested a bit more bit when we told her that if she did not calm down and keep a polite tone we would call the authorities. She went back to her room. 

At this point I’m thinking the tasers just might happen. But perhaps it’s over. I packed up and went home to throw back a few whiskeys.  

A little bit later, I’m told she goes to have dinner at the lobby bar. The FOM sees her and makes a point to just quickly inform the bartender to not accept any GCs from her and to send her to the FD. Sally behaves herself and is enjoying the company of the random stranger next to her for a bit then decides to call it a night. When she pays her bill, she does it. She tries to pay with a GC! 

This bitch… 

She argued a bit because of the inconvenience but eventually goes back to her room. That’s when I get all caught up. 

We did not ever get to see the GC ourselves as she held on to it when the bartender refused it. However I will follow up with her tomorrow to let her know she’s not welcome back. 

I’m sorry it wasn’t more thrilling but at least this will be the last of her.

UPDATE 2: I had the pleasure of going to her room with security this morning to ask her to vacate the room and not come back. She got nasty quick however when I told her it was over for her when she tried to pay with a GC after our discussion. We were willing to let it be after the chargeback but she just had to push the boundary and we can no longer put up with it. She called me every name in the book as she packed her shit. I just stood there and smiled. It felt great.",104,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF53E940>
59,update on the ealry check in,"So i did dnr him. He comes to me this morning saying he has a new reservation for today. I say ok but its not gone throught yet. He leaves for a couple of hours tries again still nothing. 

He says its right here emailed confirmed. 

I take a look and its for a differnt location. One way across town. 

To avert any issues i tell him we are sold out and cant book him in a new one. 

I got to look at the one on his phone and it said check in for 3/18 co 3/20. So hes gonna be suprised to find theres no more reservation for him at that location. 

He goes upstairs not even 5 min later calls donw to the desk asking for a manager luckly shes next to me. He claims he paid for a delux suite for two night. Ummm no yiu did not. She had to explain what he had. 

I mentioned yesterday that he wanted to extend but i told him he needed to make a new reservation. So at this point dudes not making much sense. 

Im betting he thought hed get away with trying to make 2 separate ones and use at the same location. No it dont work that way. 

Amd now because of him we are no longer taking prepaid cards. Only debit or credit cards. 

We had to get housekeeping to knock it was way past check out time. I really thought we was going to have to get the owner to kick him out. 

Thankfully he left in peace. 

I am nice and helpful as i can be but when someone accuses me of stealing their card number and then films me it rubs me the wrong way. 🙃",2,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF53E9A0>
60,Hockey parents should sleep outside. Change my mind.,"I originally started working at my hotel as a laundry attendant, but after about 10 months I decided to start doing Night Audit. Front desk was understaffed and I felt like falling under the umbrella of housekeeping was miserable. The entire department is horribly toxic and unforgiving, I would actually cry after work because I was so stressed out. So when Night Audit opened up I decided to try something new. So now I’ve been doing 3rd shift for a few weeks. Well obviously we’re in hockey season right now and there are children everywhere. I’ve worked through hockey season before but I was just hiding back in the laundry room. 

WELL ITS A WHOLE NEW GAME NOW. 

I knew that the kids could be bad and I knew the parents can be rude, but last night was a first hand experience. My first hockey weekend as front desk. 

I come in at 11 and there are like 30 people in the lobby. They’re loud AF and quiet time was an hour ago. You can smell the alcohol the further into the building you get. 2nd shift dude is like hiding in the back office. 

Me: You look like you’re not having a very good time.
*2nd: I am so over it, like I am so fed up with these people.*
Me: Okay well it’s quiet time and you know you’ve got to put your foot down.
*2nd: Yeah but like I was just out there and I’ve told them. It was worse earlier, like they quieted down a little. But I’ve already had a complaint from this old lady on first floor.*
Me: Yeah because they are loud and obnoxious, of course people are going to complain. It’s the middle of the night. 

Then he informs me that all the kids are in their rooms playing video games and stuff and that it really is just the parents that are out in the lobby. Just a bunch of full grown adults being super loud, yelling over each other, acting like they’re at a party or something. 

So we switch shifts and he leaves for the day. Now I’m at the computer trying to start my paper work and these people are like actually screaming laughing and this one woman is yelling over everyone telling a story to someone on the other end of the table. Some bitch is doing a drumroll on the table, 2 more are now literally racing to the public restroom, and then I’ve got this woman like tripping over herself trying to get out of a chair. They’ve got 2 TVs going on high volume, one TV is being yelled at because someone isn’t passing a ball, the other TV is being laughed at intermittently between loud stories about past hockey games and someone’s kid getting taken off the ice by “THIS LITTLE KID, HE’S NOT EVEN A MAN WHY IS HE TELLING MY SON THAT THEY’RE PULLING HIM OFF THE ICE I MEAN WHO DOES THIS KID THINK HE IS?!?!!” 

So I’ve got some time sensitive shit to do and then 11:40 rolls around, they are like going through waves of normal and high volume. I start getting a headache and all I can think about is my early birds that are gonna come down for coffee at 5am. So I go over to their tables and I insert myself into their drunken circle. 

Me: Hey guys? HEY! It is almost midnight now and it is WELL past quiet time. I understand that someone has already asked you to quite down, and a guest has already complained about the noise. I need to you to quiet down. 
*Mom#1: ooOOhhh I’m sorryyy yes we understand I’m sorry we’ll be more quiet.*
*Mom#2: Hmmm yeah okay sorry.*
Me: You are welcome to stay in the lobby if you would like, but I need you to tone it down for the sake of our other guests. You can stay down here as long as you can talk quietly. 
*Mom#1: Nooooooo no it’s okay it’s okay it’s okay yeah* (She starts pushing her chair into an imaginary table only to look over and then see that the table is on the other side of her, then she looks back at me and is still saying “nooo we understand it’s okay” and then lifts up the chair and puts it next to the actual table.)
Me: Thank you for understanding… 
*Dad#2: Okayyyyy but so is there a place we CAN talk loudly then? Like where do we go to talk loud?*
Me: Outside. 
*Dad#2 and Dad#3 both look at me like I’ve just offended their ancestors.*
Me: Quiet time is 10pm, it is now 11:45. I have guests here who work construction, I have guests here who are working up at the hospital. All of them wake up around 4:30 to 5:00 in the morning. There are rooms above us and there are rooms just down the hall, they can all hear how loud you are. They are trying to sleep and you are going to keep them up. 
*(Dad#3 looked at me really weird like super wide eyed when I said that people wake up at 4:30-5:00?? Like yeah man we are mostly business and these people have jobs to do, they aren’t here to throw a party in the lobby and stumble over each other. This isn’t a bar like wtf, where do you think you are?)*

After that they seemed to take me as seriously as drunk people actually can. Serious but not serious enough to be more self aware. Like sorry to break it to you but the world doesn’t revolve around you. I can absolutely kick you out of the lobby and if you don’t cooperate then I can just kick you out of the hotel. Surprisingly, rules do apply to hockey parents, even the cOoL ones who leave 30 small children unattended on the 4th floor so they can go chug beers in the lobby. Also surprisingly the children stayed in their rooms. I didn’t see a single one on the hall cameras. I also didn’t get a single noise complaint about any children. I didn’t even so much as HEAR a child all night. It’s just the damn parents living it up in the lobby not giving a shit about anyone but themselves. 

And no they didn’t even go to the game yet, it wasn’t a celebration, they haven’t won anything, they have done nothing besides drive here and then get drunk. Or possibly got drunk and then drove here. Around 2am I still had a small group of parents in the lobby talking about stupid shit. 

Yeah okay Karen, they cop is totally an asshole for making you do a sobriety test when you’ve just confessed to swerving and speeding, drunk as fuck in the middle of the night. He shouldn’t have put you in the drunk tank, no he definitely should’ve just let you keep driving until you kill someone. Then maybe a warning would be appropriate. Like what a bunch of idiots. 

“Oh my god and I like drank 3 hours before I had to go into work so I just said screw it and went to work drunk hahahahaha” 

“He was just such an asshole, he just wanted to feel good about himself. I wasn’t even going that fast, like I went over the line maybe twice and he pulled me over. It was such bullshit, and I was wearing perfume but he still said he smelled it and made me WALK THE FUCKING LINE.”

“Guy made me walk the line one time and I just like really focused and I made it almost the whole way but then he said something to me and I lost focus and I stumbled. Then he totally knew I was drunk. But like! If he wouldn’t have said anything! Like just shut up and let me focus!”

“Yeah she pulled me over because I went through a stop but I can’t even remember. But she came up to the window and asked me to step out. I don’t even know why because honestly I don’t think you could’ve been able to tell that I was unsteady like. AT. ALL. I thought I was doing just fine but she was obviously bored. She asked me a bunch of stupid questions and when I got confused she said that I was totally drunk and like I don’t even get it. What kind of trick is that???”

“Oh my god I have that picture of J.D. on the hood of your car HAHAHAHA! I didn’t even see him until you got out of the driveway. I cannot believe he climbed up there oh my god I must’ve been so drunk I just laughed my ass off.”

“See I don’t even think it’s that big of a deal like I corrected myself and he gave me shit for it anyway. THERE WAS NO ONE ELSE ON THE ROAD!”

So yeah I just really wish they would’ve gone outside. I have to deal with them again tonight. I hope they don’t win the game, the fact that the first thing they did after arriving was immediately get drunk and ignore their children just means that if they have a reason to celebrate then it’s going to be even worse. I’m gonna go insane listening to their “reasonable” explanations as to why it’s okay to drink and drive. 

These kids are doomed and hockey parents are a plague. Sorry but I want to throw them all in the dumpster.",51,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF53EA00>
61,I dare you to commit fraud!,"Update is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheFrontDesk/comments/ti9syr/update_i_dare_you_to_commit_fraud/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)!

Hello my fellow hospitality heathens! It’s been a while since I’ve posted here but, I wanted to share with you the story of this guest I have checking in later today. 

I work at 200ish room Boutique Hotel in a small, very wealthy town. We do not have a “no locals” policy. However, our DNR list is made up of mainly entitled locals who just don’t know when to stop. I have a feeling this local coming in today might just be the newest addition to that list. 

The last time this guest was in (we will call her Sally), she brought her mother and had a pretty good time. This was just before New Years. She did pull the Karen card a bit but nothing too bad. She has a history of making complaints to get things for free. As she was checking out she inquired about purchasing gift certificates so that her and her mother could partake in a little self care throughout the year and use the GCs to pay for everything. A total of $2400 in GCs were purchased. In her mind, buying the GC right then was her way of holding her self to her New Years resolution (of being a giant PITA). 

Fast forward a couple of days and Accounting  is emailing asking about the charge because the bank called and said the owner of the card is claiming fraud. We provided signed receipts however, Sally managed to still get her money back. She had also used the same card to sign up for a fitness membership to our gym. All is not lost for the hotel since is was just the certificates and membership that she used the card for. So I decided to give her a call. When she didn’t answer, I left her a message stating the GCs came back as fraudulent and were no longer valid. I also mentioned that the membership was also void however, if she wanted to come in and provide a different card, we would be happy to honor it. At that point I figured we would never see her again. She never returned my phone call, most likely out of embarrassment, so we just moved on. 

Now, just after a full moon, she’s coming in and my gut is telling me she is going to try and use those certificates. Maybe she thinks it’s been long enough that we have forgotten? Sorry Sally… I don’t forget a $2400 chargeback. My plan is to confront her at check in and play a little dumb. I might say something along the lines of “someone tried to purchase fraudulent GCs in your name! I hope all of that got sorted out for you. What card would you like to use for incidentals?”

Hopefully something like that will keep her from trying but a part of me wishes she would try. I’d LOVE to have that convo with her!

Wish me luck! Any suggestions on what to say at check in are welcomed.",131,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF53EA60>
62,Just frustrated NA who needs to vent,"I’m not even an hour into my NA shift and I’m already ~heated~. Let me preface this by saying I absolutely hate the lazy POS we have working second shift. Because literally this is his fault 

I work at a small Shmampton property (less than 70 rooms and they’re all standard). We have a college sports team staying with us this weekend, oh boy. When I arrived tonight, there was only two arrivals and we were sold out!! Score, easy night for me!

At least… it was easy for the first 15 minutes. I get one of the two remaining arrivals to check in. One tier under super sparkly pants, give them the valued member spiel and send them on their way.

Well… lucky me! The room they were set to check into was already occupied! I’m scrambling and apologize since the system showed the room vacant and it had been preassigned to them all day today. I only have one other room left and it’s already spoken for. But they’re almost-super-shiny! So I inform them I’ll get them moved (since they’re here) but it’s the last room and it has two queens, not a single king like they booked. 

“Well, we booked this months in advance! We want what we booked!” 

Internal eye roll. “Yes ma’am, I do see that and I apologize. We’re sold out tonight and I’m actually going to have to cancel a different reservation to get you guys moved. Or I can cancel your reservation if you’d like to stay at a different property.” No, they take the room. I get the room moved, they’re ok now. 

Now it’s the matter of calling the poor sap with no tier who got booted in favor of the high tier member and trying to figure out what happened with the college. 

Calling this guy should be quick right? Well, he doesn’t answer. Call again. No answer. Leave a voicemail. Cancel the room anyway and send an email. Not like he’d be able to check in anyways. I’d have to cancel anyway  when he got here and help him find a room.  

On to the college. Only way this would’ve happened is for second shift to have given an additional set of premade keys to the group. At this point, I’m assuming all of their rooms plus this additional one are occupied. Call all the rooms, yep all occupied. So now I have to book an additional room for this college group. Cool, I guess. I finally get them all settled.

And for a moment, I had peace. Enough time to get a drink. Now, literally as I’m writing this, the member who’s room got cancelled shows up. I haven’t even had time to look for options for him before he showed up. I’m trying my best to be kind and explain what happened and he’s just going off on me. Because he booked and ”paid” (no you didn’t) and so I’m basically saying “don’t book at [brand] because even if you’re a member you don’t matter?!” and just carrying on yelling and throwing a fit. That’s it. You’ve worn my patience. I’m done. I tell him his room got cancelled due to an issue with a higher tier member’s room and we are sold out and there is absolutely nothing open. “Well, just a refund isn’t going to cut it.” Sir again you haven’t even paid the room. You’re not being charged. I was ~going~ to help you call around and find something but you’ve just dicked that option away. Tell him that his info will be forwarded to the manager when she gets back Monday. Apologize again and just left the desk. Dude is still, even while writing this, loitering in the lobby. After how he spoke to me, I still have no desire to help him. 

By this point. My patience is gone. I’m losing my sanity. I want so badly to just walk out and leave. It’s not worth it. It’s not worth it. Tell me not to do it. It’s been an hour and a half now. I just want to do my work in peace and enjoy warm soup.",52,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF53EAC0>

64,EALRY CHECK IN IS NOT GUARANTEED,"Normally, on slower days, we can check people in early. But when we were sold out the night before theres no way to check them in early. The managers do their best in checking rooms you have ready, but if hsk is slow, it backs everything up. 

I get about 6 or 7 differnt guest trying to check in early, but I have to turn them and tell them to come back at 3. 

There is no guarantee we can do early; sometimes, we can't even guarantee it for our members. 

Most were like, ""ok, I'll be back at 3."" But not this one guy. 

This cunt of a so called man comes in at 2 pm. I say Sir rooms are not ready yet it won't be till 3 before I can check you in. He comes back at me, saying they let him check in early last time. I wanted to get in and rest before work. First his reservation had not even came through yet. It takes about 5 min after hitting send for it to get to us. 

I say yes, sir. I understand that, but that's only if we have the rooms available; there is no guarantee. They are checking rooms, but its gonna be closer to 3 before I'm able to get you into a room. 

Him... Well, can you at least let me pay now? 

Fd.. No, sir, I have to wait till rooms are ready to process anything. 
One it really wouldn't make a difference, I still can't put you in a room until they check them. And 2 check-in is at 3. 

Him... So you're saying I can't check in. 

Fd.. No, I can't 

Him.... This is stupid. (Rant Rant Rant Rant) 

Just on and on about it. 

I hear him bitching about it to someone hes talkign to asking them because they work at a hotel. 

I'm just thinking... ok, and they don't work at this one. I cant fucking give you something indont fucking have. 

I felt with this guy last week. He had a janky ass card all taped up and broken that really didn't go into my card reader and really wouldn't read. He then basically accused me of trying to steal his card number. 

Well flash to this week.... he says he's going to wait in the lobby (which is fine, whatever). He says, ""Can he buy a drink ? "" Yes, that's fine. He comments on how I was giving a hard time. I, sir, I'm not im just going by company policies. Do you want a receipt? Yeah, you didn't give me one last time.. Yes, sir, I did.(I distantly remember because he was being very rude last time. ) I give it to him. he says, ""Why am I giving him such a hard time?"" I, of course, said I'm not. He goes to sit down. 

Around 215 rolls around. I got a walk-in. They needed a double just for tonight. Luckily, I had one available to go ahead and check them in.  No problem, I get them checked in. This cunt of  a man rushes to the desk, saying, ""Why can't he check in because I just checked in those people?"" I tell him I had that room available; it was a double yours is a king and isn't ready. I know this guy is gonna call me a racist cause they were white and he was black and thats the reason i didnt check him in first. Noooo thats not it at all his fucking room isnt ready. I know how that looked but it was not the case 

Then he wants to argue with me about it. Hes already been belligerent and rude. Then, ask for the managers number. I said all I have is the contact info on the hotels card. He asked if I had a different number for him. I say no; that's the only one. 

I have the owners personal number, but I'm not giving it out to a guest. 

He then goes off, saying he's going to write a complaint. ( ok, do it. Agian, I can't give you something I don't FUCKING HAVE READY). 😤

He goes back to his table for like a minute and comes back to the desk with his phone in hand. I know this ass hole was filming me. 

My boss called about putting a room out for the night. So, I informed her about the whole thing. 

I tell her they need to flag this guy cause hes being rude and belligerent with me and also filming me. I do not feel comfortable with him staying here. 😕 she said she's on her way back down. She also informs the other owners about it. 

I finally got some rooms open around 245. I get him checked in, and he asks if that was the boss next to me. It was. He goes on his way. He asks if hes able to extend. Its not extendable he has to make a new one tomorrow. 

The boss man said one that if they don't have a chip on the card, we no longer will be taking it. And if someone acts like that to me again to just cancel their reservation, and tell them to leave. Thank god the owner will always have my back in situations like this. Plus that guy always books on line and never puts a valid card on file. So its not like they are losing money. 

Its just so infuriating on how people can be so disrespectful. I cannot give you something i dont have. Im not being petty or rude im going by what company policy is. And if you want to record me for doing my job then do it. I wasnt trying to be rude or have an attitude but you being that vile to someone just doing thier job is unacceptable.",45,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF53EB80>
65,It’s the small things that people do that make me love my job.,"Just helped a guest bring up their luggage since they’re physically disabled and we don’t have people to bring up luggage at my location. I’m glad my coworker was there so I was able to do it for them because if he wasn’t I wouldn’t have been able to. Their stuff was super heavy but I didn’t want the lady to have to try pushing it up herself or have to wait on her person she was there with to help her. She was super nice to me and even tipped me in the end and she didn’t even have to do that. My job is really stressful and I have to deal with a lot of rude and demanding people, but it’s small things like this that really make me love my job.

66,Banned list gets longer?,"Okay, so I'm the GM of a small mom and pop type motel in FL. Most of the people who stay here are homeless, drunks, druggies, or prostitutes. I lived in the motel with my hubby from August until February. I'm also having a baby in 3 weeks, which is relevant. We took over management March 1st.

I have a policy handout that each guest gets before they pay/register. It literally says if you break the rules, you'll be kicked out with no refund, no matter how long the stay is. I even highlighted and made it capitals and bold print.

So enter our wonderful Karen. Karen comes in and wants a room for a week. She says it's for her, her SO, and their 3 month old son. Cool. So I go over policy, get her registered, and all is good. I tell her to have her SO come in later to scan in his ID, so he can be registered. Unregistered guests are $50 and can get you kicked out after 9 pm.

Cue about 1 am. My husband, who does maintenance/grounds keeping, is doing a final round before bed. I'm already in bed, waiting to watch a movie with him.  He walkies me to tell me that Karen has a guest. Since I am hugely pregnant and on bed rest (I'm on bed rest for GD and preeclampsia, so I can't do anything but light office work) I send him and our impromptu security guard to their room. They tell Karen to come to the office in the morning to pay the fine. She agrees, they leave. Mind you, they told me where they rented before they came to us. An inn that we're friends with. So I call and get the info on them.

Cue about noonish. No one shows up. So H and ISG knock on the door and a random dude answers. He comes to the office. I tell him the sitch and he leaves. Super respectful dude. Turns out he paid over half of the amount for the week stay. They were renting out the room to someone else, which is hella illegal. There was also drug paraphernalia and used condoms found in the room. It adds up, cuz they got banned from the other place for illegal subletting, prostitution, and drug trafficking. So ISG calls Karen and says she has until 1:30 to come get all her shit and get out.

Her SO comes, gets their shit, and leaves. Ends up leaving dozens of drinks in the fridge, and some Narcan. I've been getting threatening phone calls, dragged through the mud on Facebook, and have horrible reviews because of these people. It's been great. What's even better is Karen will call and talk to me to bitch about the owner and his fat wife. When in reality she's bitching about my husband and ISG. No wonder my blood pressure is so high 😂😂",37,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF53EC40>
67,"Felt really good after work, thanks to a Karen","Gods, I had a good ending to my day at work.

30 minutes before I was supposed to leave, this girl comes up to the desk wearing nothing but a star-wars onesie. Says she's here to check-in. I ask her for the name, her ID, card, phone number, get everything set up, blah de blah to blah... aaaand her card declines.

""What do you mean it declined? Wasn't this paid for already?""
""No. We don't charge or authorize anything until you arrive. Then we authorize the card for the stay.""
""Well, can I pay at the end of the stay?""
""Not without a cash deposit.""
""I only have $20 on this card! I don't get paid till Sunday!""

This goes on and on and on, till she decides to get her mother on the phone to fill out a Credit Card Authorization form. Her mother is equally frustrating to deal with, arguing about why I can't take her card over the phone, why I 'have to make this more complicated than it needs to be', refusing to give me her email or other information, and stuff like that. FINALLY my coworker shows up, half an hour after this whole ordeal began. At this point, I'm just trying to get her to fill out the form and send it back. She doesn't have a printer and she doesn't understand what Microsoft Paint is. I'm like, banging my head against a wall because how the FUCK have you never had to remotely fill out a form in this day and age? All while she continues to bark in my ear about how ""This is pointless"" and ""This is so unsecure, why is this required, why do I have to do this?""

Anyways, after some time of trying to get that done, her daughter wants to talk to her again, so I hand the phone over and begin explaining the situation, since it's the end of my shift. ""Okay, so basically she can't afford the room, and doesn't have a card that can hold the authorization...""

And she snaps back at me with ""I've been at the hospital all day, you should show a little more *respect*!"" (We are located not far from a hospital, we see people all the time from there. It's literally our number one source of income.)

Anyways, I don't know why, maybe because it was the end of my day, and week, and I'm transferring to a different hotel anyways... maybe it's because I was tired and irked, and they'd wasted my time for 40 fucking minutes now, but I just... didn't care to uphold a ""professional"" look. So I responded.

`""Ma'am, you're trying to afford a $130 hotel on a card with only $20 on it. Your mother can't figure out what a pdf is. I've seen three dozen other people with sob stories about their hospital visits, just in this hotel today. They're already in a room, sleeping, because they could pay for it. Quite frankly, I've worked in this industry for 4 years now and am leaving anyways, so... if you can't afford our services, we are under no obligation to give them to you, no matter what your life situation is. Goodbye.""`

And I walked away to clock out. Her screaming about ""how dare you!"". How ""unprofessional"" and ""disrespectful"" I am and my coworker just looking at me walk away, dumfounded and without words. When I came back, she had stormed out of the hotel. At the very least, I solved a problem before my coworker had to deal with it.

Best part? I go on vacation for the next week. I don't have to deal with the consequences of this for at least a week, and I doubt they'll even bother since I'm transferring anyways.",44,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF53ECA0>
68,Karen scathingly informs me that I am the most miserable person she's ever met,"Background: NA at a small extended stay hotel. This happened last September, but I wrote an incident report the night of that I'm referring to as a write this.

It's about 3:30 in the morning and has so far been a quiet night. I'm in the middle of turning day when an older blond woman comes down saying that her children just could not *believe* how incredibly rude I had been to them earlier and couldn't stop talking about it, so she *had* to come down here and let me know that it was unacceptable. I've talked to maybe three people tonight, and none of those interactions were anything noteworthy, so I am extremely confused.

**Me:** I'm...sorry to hear that, ma'am. It's never my intention to come off as rude. I'm not sure what interaction they could be referring to, though-- What did they say happened?  
**K:** They just couldn't believe someone so unpersonable would work in this industry! I don't want to file a complaint or anything but-- \*blah blah blah\*

The fact that she can't even list a *single* specific grievance is all the proof I need to know that she is either making this up wholesale or blowing it wildly out of proportion. While I nod along to her long rambling full of personal insults about me, I try to figure out who her kids may have been. The only people young enough had been a pair who'd bought some chips from the market around midnight-- AKA, *well over three hours ago*. 

I am, admittedly, not the kind of FD agent who easily makes casual chit chat with guests. It's just not my personality and, frankly, generally neither I nor the guest are in the mood for chit chat in the wee hours of the morning. Every now and then someone will take offense to this and it's come up in a couple of performance reviews, but it's not the kind of thing young people will generally complain ""non-stop"" about for *hours*. *Especially* considering that **I was on the fucking phone when they were checking out**! Someone had called while they were in the market and I was still on the line when they came to check out. I apologized when I was able to hang up and wished them a good night, since I'd already gotten payment etc. They left without seeming the least bit scandalized.

Back to Karen, I am honestly mystified by why this woman has taken it upon herself to be so offended by literally nothing. When she's finally done telling me about my poor character I apologize again for coming off as rude and ask her to pass that on to her children.

An awkward beat of silence.

**Me:** Uh...is there anything else that I can help you with?

She stares slack-jawed at me. I stare back, having no Earthly idea what she is expecting from me at this point.

And then a random guy starts fast walking through the lobby with his dog, who is just walking around freely, un-leashed.

**Me:** I'm sorry sir, but your dog can't be outside of your room without a leash.  
**Guy:** Do you want it to crap on your floor?! I'm taking it out!!

He starts walking even faster and is out the door before I can answer. I am obviously annoyed and stand up to follow him. Karen, clearly vindicated that I am now showing my true colors, butts in.

**K:** This is *exactly* what your problem is! He's *fine*!  
**Me:** No, ma'am, he is *not* 'fine'. It is hotel policy that pets be leashed at *all times* outside of rooms.

I then proceeded to completely ignore Karen and sweep outside to continue dealing with dog guy. He does, apparently, *have* a leash-- it's just that his dog needed to go *so urgently* that he didn't have time to grab it (the dog has yet to use the restroom, and is just aimlessly sniffing around), and that he's a super great guy for making sure his dog didn't do its business in our hotel room. I know that this is utter bullshit, but instead of calling him on it I simply tell him that the leash policy is non-negotiable, and that if his dog is out of his room without a leash again for any reason he will be kicked out, and that he must *carry* his dog back to his room (it was a small dog) instead of letting it run around.

**K, directly behind me:** You are just the most *miserable* person that I have ever met. I hope that one day you stop taking it out on everyone around you and get out of this industry.

I hadn't realized that Karen had followed me out here and just rolled my eyes without turning to look at her, since I could already hear her stomping off. Dog Guy had no reaction to this whatsoever-- I'm not actually sure he heard it. Once I make sure that Dog Guy is heading back to his room with pupper in hand I return to the desk and write all this up. I'm not sure what became of Karen after this or if she followed up with management-- I never heard anything else about it if she did.",70,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF53ED00>
69,I don’t care what your check in age is!,This literally happened a few minutes ago and just for context the check in age at my hotel is 21. This guy and his girlfriend come in and I’m going through the normal check in stuff and I ask for the Id and the the guy is 18 and so he calls his mom who says that she talked to someone for about 20 minutes and said that they can check in at 18. The guy hangs up and I went ahead and checked him in since he’s so far from home and I received a call on the hotel phone from his mom ranting about how I’m wrong and that she needs names and that upper management is going to hear about it. Eventually I got her to hang up but I hate people and she was the reason I had to go to my car to get anxiety medicine.,79,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF53ED60>
70,The Plot Thickens,"So.... my guess of why NA no called no showed was right.

He was in jail. 

How did we find this out you may ask...

He got re-arrested by our local PD at the hotel for violating his bond. His original arrest was for terroristic threat of a family. He had a whole ass ankle monitor on that I didn't notice the one day I saw him. 

My time off ""request"" has been denied. GM is covering NA for the rest of the week. She hired someone for part time NA, and they start next week. Hopefully this one lasts longer than a month.

As soon as new part time NA is trained fully, and we find out what is going to happen with currently in jail NA, I'm taking vacation. I've told my boss this isn't optional. I'm working 10+ hour days for the rest of this week and the entirety of next week. And for who knows how long. 

The GM's favorite does come back, so GM will be back in her office full time. Honestly, thank fuck for that, because I've been fixing her mistakes since 2pm today. She's great at just doing GM stuff, but front desk stuff is way outside of her purview for our system. She called me for something that is in the front desk book last night at 1AM. 

To top off a shit day, I injured my back putting up our breakfast order at 5:30pm, because it had been sitting since 1pm, and there was nobody there that could help me. Late Bitch is also a lazy bitch. She didn't even mention that it had come in, and if it weren't for our DOS, I wouldn't have known, because I have no reason to go in the kitchen. 

I also looked up labor laws for my state, and I may be entitled to overtime, so thanks for the people who told me about it!",19,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF53EDC0>
71,Baseball is Back!,"Now that the lockout is over and Spring Training has resumed, our rates are quite high.  This is great for the property, but can be rough on the FDA's.  

The first games were today and our rate, after tax, is about $190.  Tomorrow and Saturday, the rate, after tax, is $300.

Cue the angry and downright stupid phone calls!

One of my favorites:  
""How far away are you from the Dodgers Spring Training camp?""

I give him the answer.

""How much for a room for Friday and Saturday?  Three adults, 1 child.""

I give him the answer, which is well over $600.

""What?  Why is the rate so high?""

Because it's spring training.

""We don't care about baseball.  We aren't coming there for that.""

Then why the flip was your first question how far away we are from their training camp?

I wish people would understand that we don't care WHY you are coming here - if you are here when the rates a high, that is what you are going to be charged.  

For all of you that are working in hospitality near the spring training camps - stay sane!!",14,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF53EE20>
72,Did I handle this correctly? [short],"Long time lurker. Second House Suites FDA here, just gonna paste my logbook entry and edit out any identifying information.

""A lady called asking about our long term stays. I said the best person to talk to is \[REDACTED\], our director of sales and gave her the number when she was ready. I said the best time to call would be tomorrow morning before noon. She said she needed a room tonight, I said great, we’ll check you in under the rack rate and when \[REDACTED\] gets in we’ll negotiate a rate with you and switch it over. She said that she called other hotels where they were willing to do this and then she said “I’m in a situation in which someone’s trying to kill me and I need to hide from them for a month, so thanks for nothing,” “Ma’am we can absolutely do that, I’m just sorry we can’t get you the rate you’re looking for tonight.” She hung up."" Feel like she might've just been fishing to tug at my heartstrings to get what she wanted. The part about her being in hiding spooked me, but we ARE business after all... so?

73,the one where the guest takes a Chargeback all the way to arbitration,"I don't work at a typical hotel, I'm work in the fraud department of a Vacation rental company. Our portfolio contains thousands of properties raging from private homes to luxury resorts and everything in between. Guests end up talking to my team before they are able to check in so we are kind of like a front desk.   


We  went back to our standard cancellation policies a few months ago and are no longer making exceptions for COVID. The insurance company we use to offer guests trip insurance covers COVID cancellations so we stopped being flexible with cancellations. This story is not about COVID though.   


3 months ago a guest calls in to cancel. Her check in is the next day so it's a hard no any kind of refund. she booked a mansion for a week at $40,000 She demands a manager but I refuse. They are going to tell her the same thing. She starts telling me that she didn't even know she had a reservation, and this is where it gets good.   


Me: ma'am I can see that we emailed the confirmation several times, and the form for identity verification which you completed, and the check-in email.   


Guest: well I never got them!   


Me: Ma'am I can see that the emails were delivered and we track them so I know you opened the confirmation email on X date at X time and you had it open for 5 minutes. I can see you completed the identity verification through the link we sent to you in your email, and I can see that you just opened the check in email right before you called me. You got all of our emails, you knew about the reservation, and you knew the cancellation policy. I don't believe you didn't notice $40k leave your account. There is nothing I can do for you.   


Guest: well I'm just going to tell the bank this is fraud! fuck you!   


Me: no problem, my team will handle that and fight the dispute, We have all the evidence we need to do so.   


she hung up.   


I pass all the info along to our disputes team. 3 months later I'm on a zoom call with our finance team, an arbitrator, and the guest. She looks just like the karen she sounded like. platinum blonde bob and a pinched face . She had pushed this dispute to the point of suing us. During the arbitration we played the call and submitted the email log for the arbitrator to review.   


I cannot tell you the satisfaction of watching her face drop as she admits on the call recording to filing a false fraud claim. We were awarded back the full amount and she is blocked from tens of thousands of properties.",46,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF53EEE0>
74,My son can pee wherever he wants to,"I'm working in a quiet, smallish (71 units), hotel, located in one of the busiest holiday-destinations of Europe.

This happened about three years ago, so I'm paraphrasing.

I was sitting behind my reception desk, merrily waiting to interact with some of our guests, when I saw some of them approaching me from our pool area.

Guest one: ""Some boy has just peed in the area of the sun-beds.""

Guest two: ""And his parents were cheering him on.""

Guest three: ""Some of us got wet.""

My eyes went wide and almost popped out.

Me: ""I beg your pardon ?""

I followed them outside and confronted the parents.

They said: ""He needed to pee, it's on the outside, so there's no big deal, and our son can pee wherever he likes to.""

Meanwhile, the boy in question was grinning at me.

I asked for their names and room number, excused myself for a moment, went back to my beloved front-desk, and checked them.

They were due to check-out the following day (the boy was 11, btw.), so I decided to give them a stern warning, apologised to the other guests, and told the family that I would show them the door, if they ever did something like that again. The other guests were ok with my decision, so I didn't take any further action.

The family checked out the following morning without any further incidents.

Note: our manageress had already gone home, and she left me in charge with all managerial duties and powers. 
She usually did this to the employees she trusted whenever she was out. And she later commended me for having handled the situation so well.

She's retiring on the 1st of April, and all of us are going toiss her.",58,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF53EF40>
75,We are Heartless part 2,"For whatever reason, my original story got cut off about half-way through and I didn't notice till now. I could have edited it to include the rest, but some people who have read the first part may not have known to go and visit the thread again. 

Here is the first half.........

https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheFrontDesk/comments/tg435n/we_are_heartless_or_so_im_told/

Anywho, let me continue..........

After the night manager kicked Sally and Sam out of the room, the night manager still honored their request to watch their luggage......even up unto tomorrow. They ""disappeared"" around 6:30pm and the night manager didn't have any more updates. 

I settled in on my NA shift and my security lady(Jessie) started doing her rounds of the property. BTW, we have 4 buildings. She radioed me that Sam and Sally was UNDERNEATH the outdoor stairway of building C. They had a blanket and a bicycle with them. Jessie told them that they couldn't camp out on the property like that. They also told her that they were waiting on a ride. Jessie told them that they could wait in the lobby(which I was fine with). They didn't do it though. 

Later Jessie found them back under the stairway again.....but this time we were getting complaints about the couple smoking under the stairs as well. Keep in mind that they were apparently ""waiting for a ride"" since 5:30pm and it was now almost 12am. Also, keep in mind that while they were waiting for somebody to pick them up, they snuck back into the old room and went to sleep. They knew they weren't allowed in there. 

Sam told Jessie that he could go ""wherever the $$$$ I want"". I called the police. 

The police were very cool and had them grab their luggage from the luggage cart in the lobby and to leave the property. While Sam was in the middle of gathering their belongings he ALSO made comments about us being heartless(like that unrelated guest from #218 in the first post). He made it seem like we were the jerks and said he was going to call corporate to file a formal complaint. 

I asked him what was he going to report us for? ""For not wanting you on property 13 hours longer than normal checkout time?""

He fronted up/postured like he was bracing himself for a fight and spouted off some nonsense like, ""WHAT??"".  Oh, he heard me. He just didn't anything else to say. I must admit it was slightly concerning that he was willing to put on airs like he was about to get physical with 2 cops 20 feet away. 

The funny thing is that the member reservations they had weren't even in his name. It was in Sally's name(who was a lot more cool). 

As of typing this, I'm considering asking my GM to file a complaint against their membership. I've never asked my GM to do this on anybody, even people with worse behavior. However, for them to get so much goodwill, and without being held financially responsible, and then to act like we are being ""heartless""........it grinds my gears.",14,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF53EFA0>
76,Watching 'Inventing Anna' reminds me of a fraud situation I dealt with!,"First off I have been a long time lurker/occasional commenter and I love reading all these stories that I can relate to, so thank yall. 

This happened a few years ago... To begin, the property I supervised had a Direct Bill setup with a local hospital for out of town/state people coming to work or help out at the hospital, they came from everywhere and sometimes stayed one night sometimes months. The hospital HR/AR/Billing had many employees and quiote a few turnovers so it was always a different person setting up reservations with us for their travelers. So needless to say when we got a call to book a room for Dr. Scamster it was business as usual. We booked the room, setup direct bill and even got the appropiate paperwork faxed to us! Dr. Scamster came to check in, super nice guy with doctor vibes, ID and CC for incidentals all matched up. 

This is where it got interesting. He would call from the hospital (called Id) and act as an employee from there saying stuff like Dr. Scamster will be recieving important packages to the hotel, schedule housekeeping, and also let us know he would be travelling out of town on the weekends, normal things that happen with other hospital employees that stayed with us. This is what triggered my suspicion when I would talk to him at the hotel and when I would talk to the hospital employee over the phone... The voices and way of talking were the fucking same!!! 

I inform the GM, he calls the hospital and after a couple days of investigation we find out he is a fraud, never worked at the hospital and has done this to other hotels!!! We got to the room and he is gone! belongings and all!!! Ending to this he ended up getting arrested but we had to reimburse the hospital for his whole stay and he was supposed to pay us and the other hotels restitution after his trial, I left that property soon after so not sure what came about of it all.",18,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF53F040>
77,We Are Heartless (Or So I'm Told),"I clocked in for Night Audit(11pm-7am) and the night manager told me about the guests in #218 who had caused a hour long fuss at check-in because they were required to do a security hold/deposit. They claimed that they didn't have any money, even though they came from California to Florida and had a rental car. How would they get back home? Well, that's a mystery, isn't it? These guests went back and forth with the FDAs and called them ""heartless"". Eventually, they relented and produced a credit card. They seemed to be complain-y about their room, but I left an alert that nobody but management should approve any compensation.

&#x200B;

This second situation is lengthier and involves stuff going on even before I clocked in. There was a couple (Sam&Susie) in #213 who were extending day-by-day and split expenses with another lady(Julie). They had done this for several days. They decided that their final checkout would be on Wednesday.

&#x200B;

When I looked into our system, it looks like they were checked out at 3:20pm. Checkout is normally at 11am. Late check out is normally up to 1pm. There are exceptions once in a blue moon when guests may have certain ""very bad situations"" that we may push it a couple extra hours even later(at no charge).

&#x200B;

Night shift said that around 5:30pm(Wednesday) Sally and Sam informed them that Julie had stolen their money and taken off. Why they were still in the area up till 5:30pm and felt the need to tell us this info? Who knows. They wanted to keep their luggage, on a cart in the lobby, to stay at the hotel and that they would be back to collect it later that night......or tomorrow. The night manager, being a nice guy, allowed it.

&#x200B;

When he went to go inspect #213 to see the condition of the room, he found Sally and Sam sleeping inside it. They had kept a spare key(I know). He kicked them out of the room, but allowed them to continue to keep their luggage in the lobby for a time. They claimed to be waiting for a ride.

78,I have interviews lined up all this week. . .,"For reasons in my (multiple) previous posts I'm actively trying to find a new job. But with the Regional in charge and the AGM officially gone, things are continuously getting worse. As in like. . . y i k e s. 

I went to an interview I felt strongly about (but ultimately didn't take the job due to the commute) and immediately went to the hotel I'm currently employed at to let Regional know. I was going to weasel out a raise for the remainder of my time there. I had an offer for a $1.50 more an hour than what I was currently getting paid. And I also found out that despite my seven years experience, night audit position, and being the last member of the opening staff I was getting paid the same or less as the new hires. Both still on their computer training. 

I go into his office, he has no idea who I am. But I'm all polite smiles, waiting for an opportunity to strike. He begins like HE called the meeting. Saying that I'm not emailing Ursula and her team the stupid shift report. (I am just in a separate email because as the acting GM he gets additional paperwork, so why bog down his email like that?). But that's explained away. And After telling him of the job offer he offers me fifty cent LESS than the offer. But, that's not my fight. I won't be here much longer. He asks about why I looked at other places to work so I went off in the most professional way possible. I told him exactly what he asked, sternly. And he wasn't prepared for that. He thought I would owe him respect, automatically treat him like he was someone special despite him not even getting my name right. 

It's been a few days since then. I've been punished in the only way he can- by fucking with my schedule. He has me working 9 days in a row, including a sold out Thursday -Sunday, despite the other auditor having a completely free schedule. He also changed around breakfast's schedule without asking them or the Breakfast Supervisor- he didn't even bother telling them so nobody showed up to work breakfast yesterday. 

&#x200B;

But then we get to reservations- which we are hounded about to not call 'centeral res' and instead say 'our reservations department'. Since we started using them frequently we've had issues pop up. The reason for insisting we don't make reservations at the property was that it took too much time away from the guests in house or checking in. But they refuse to change rates, adjust dates when the guests asks, or cancel for them. So we end up with calls anyway. They also call for any question the guest asks. So instead of the guest just asking in a quick 'so what time is breakfast' it's 'hello there ma'am this is monica from your reservations department how are you today? \[pause\] good. that is good to here. So I am calling on behalf of our mutual guest \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ and they were just wondering what time your continental breakfast offered to guests by your hotel is? \[Pause\] Ahh, I see, I will contact this guests and let them know that the breakfast hours are six am to ten am. Thank you and have a nice day! ' WAY longer. 

And now the dreaded, evil sales team Ursula, Weasel, and now Pig Pen have decided to ramp up their torment. Ursula being the regional director of sales; Weasel being our sales manager that manages sales at another property an hour away and hasn't been in the office in a month and doesn't list her hours to be contacted; and Pig Pen, the social media coordinator that never washes her stringy hair and dresses like the reject bin at goodwill. (not knocking goodwill at all, but these clothes are dated, worn, and in horrible condition. it's unprofessional.)

The following email is directly copied, just changed the names-

Coworker, Via Email: Hi, Weasel, GUEST has a reservation under GROUP CODE coming in on the 20th and checking out the 21st. His confirmation number is 123456.He wanted to add the 19th to his reservation but rate is locked in for just the 20th and 21st. I was advised by Regional to make a separate reservationjust for the 19th to secure the room for him until we could get in contact you to see if you could add the 19th at the same rate as his group block. Thank you so much. 

Weasel: \[instead of replying just forwards it to Ursula\]

Ursula: What is this? Why would we book a separate reservation instead of calling Weasel so we could decide if we wanted to add rooms at the group rate on a shoulder night? How did we get the call? With gratitude, Ursula. 

Regional: This was not a call, the guest was at the hotel. To make sure he had a reservation for a day earlier another reservation was put in for him. He understood that he may or mat not receive the same rate. The purpose of this email was to reach out to see if the group rate would be honored. Please advise. Thank you. 

Ursula: A quick call to Weasel first would have allowed us to add a room to the block and avoid all these extra steps. At your service, Ursula. 

Regional: Agreed, but this was a quick interaction with moving parts and the guest needed to move on. The question still remains, assuming the answer is yes to honor the rate. We can get him updated in the system. 

Ursula: We need to add the room to the group block first. 

&#x200B;

AND SCENE. 

But like??? She was more focused on trying to degrade the front desk staff for HELPING THE GUEST instead of actually giving us a straight answer. 

And also ""you could have called Weasel"", yet Weasel didn't even bother replying to the email? How does that make sense? 

The reservation doesn't need to be added to the block. The rate just needed to be modified.

79,"Wedding, Church, and a Fugitive","This happened at my property this past weekend.

The lobby was empty, almost could hear an echo. 

All at once, the Church group of 95 people lets out, and everyone floods the desk for snacks, and sodas. About 20 transactions in total. 

During this, our wedding reception starts to begin. The attendees arrive in bulk, fancy dress and all. About 300 people flood our hallways as they head to their ballroom for the party. 

Suddenly two police officers come rushing in, frantically asking the FD about a man with neck tattoos. They start running, and I mean *running* around looking for this guy (who, apparently just escaped their custody).

So, as this church group is out, and around 300 people are pulling into the hotel, we also have a squadron of police pulling in, and running inside, interviewing guests, etc. They show photos, and find nothing. They decide to leave, and leave a photo at the desk so we can figure out who he is, if we see him.

20 minutes pass, the church group is still active in the lobby, but the hallway is thinning out with wedding guests.

The bride and groom arrive. There is applause and cheers of excitement.

Who pull in almost immediately after them? More police.

They come in, restarting their search, stating that they believe this fugitive got mixed into our (mostly Hispanic) church group crowd.

The Sheriff pulls in, leading his battalion. He looks through our security footage, and is directing officers around a property walk.

Again, they find nothing. They decide to leave, and the excitement dies down for a moment.

An hour and a half later, the neck tattoo man strolls up to the desk, asking for directions to a near-by restaurant. He is an exact match to the description and the picture. We send him on his way, and call the police.

In one short span of time, we had a Bride, a Priest, and a Fugitive in the same hallway.",29,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF53F160>
80,I'm going to social media,"Had a guest with his girlfriend walk in and they were obnoxious from the get go. While walking in he smacked her butt and looked at me and asked if ""I like that"" , I just laughed and asked what I could help them with. He comes in with a 3rd party reservation and I can already tell from his snarky remarks he'll be the end of my enjoyment for the night. My hotel works closely with some of the theme parks but only if you book directly through the theme park or our hotel, not 3rd parties.
He mentions he has been guaranteed early admission to the parks and front of the line access. Usually when we have a guest with this they come directly from the theme park and we are given lanyards and passes for those guest. We had none for them. I explained to him that he may need to talk to the theme park since the 3rd party is offering it and I have no passes here for them.

He gets all mad because he has to call around and begins to bad name me on the phone saying I didn't know how to do my job , I look trashy , etc . As a veteran I really don't care I've been called worse so I just let it go on by. I get a chance to speak to the 3rd party and explained to them that the guest will have to contact the theme park as we do not have any passes for them. 

He hangs up the phone before the representative can talk to him and begins recording me. He starts laughing and pointing saying that I lied and I just don't want to do my job . At this point he's holding up the line of other check ins, he even turns around and tells them he's not leaving until he gets his passes.

I explained to him once more that I don't have his passes because , as I just said, they would have been provided directly through the theme park. After I advised him that if he continues to cause a disturbance and holding up the line he would be asked to find accommodation else where . His gf finally grabs and pulls him away toward the elevator and he continues to scream, yell and record the whole way up.",40,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF53F1C0>
81,Sunday Sunday Sunday!!,"Was reading other comments which reminded me of this story.  I can’t remember exactly when this happened.  It was in the Before Times, probably 2017/2018?  Who knows. 

Anywho. 

It was Super Bowl Sunday. Everyone was excited, and folks had been staking out their domain in our lobby for hours.  We had projectors.  We had fancy football food.  Things were going well.  

There’s the singing of the anthem, the kickoff festivities, the back and the forth across the field, the commercials.  All is well, any given Sunday.  My shift comes to an end and I head home (where we recorded the game and started from the beginning with a bunch of friends who also work hospitality for different companies in e resort).  

I found out the next day all did not continue going well.  Just after the halftime show, as the teams start the 3rd quarter and cocktail waitresses are passing out the newest round of drinks, the power goes out.  

Not just our power.  All the power.  For the entire resort.  Basically the whole city.  It was dark AF outside, inside, everywhere. 

Guests get ornery.  They’re screaming at the staff to GET THE DAGGUM POWER ON as if Kellie the cocktail server can control the situation.  They threaten to leave and go to Sports Bar.  Haha, jokes on them! Sports Bar has no power.  Also, it had started to blizzard outside, making work harder for the power company.  

All in all, the power didn’t go back on until something like 2 in the morning.  Our backup generator could keep the essentials running and heat was gas based, so no one froze, but that basically shut down the lobby party.  People were pissed.  

Most eventful Superb Owl in recent memory (even if I can’t remember exactly when it was…) May it never happen again.",12,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF53F220>
82,A Wedding Not A Break,"I'm going to be posting here a lot until I'm done telling all my stories from the last two years, LOL. This one stands up as probably my craziest night, and the only night that I had to call the cops. 

I was working at a very small, boutique hotel, two miles from the docks on an island famous for not having any cars. It was about as far as you could get on the island before reaching an area that was nature preserves and like, four locals; it was definitely the furthest hotel by a long shot. Gorgeous place, loved it to death, and because of COVID, I rarely had to check anyone in, since the last ferry ran at seven. The most interaction I had with people was....wait for it...weddings! We did those. Lots of those. 

An important note here; in the basement of the hotel was an employee apartment where the daytime front desk girls lived. I lived about fifteen minutes walk away, in the name of getting better sleep and having my own bedroom. But they all lived down there so occasionally I'd see one coming back in the middle of the night, usually Coworker Natalie, who was awesome and had a gift for controlling any situation that came her way. 

So the wedding is going well. Really well! Everyone is super friendly and nice, they're having a very fun time but actually keeping the noise down, and in fact two of my coworkers were invited to party with the reception. Basically the best wedding party you could hope for, a bunch of really chill, nice people. Bar one, who we are about to meet. 

I get in at 11, at around 11:15 the giggling bride (an absolute sweetheart) and her husband head upstairs for the evening and the party goes on. I sort my checks. Direct a couple people to the bathrooms. Start reading my book. Their music taste is pretty good and not so loud that anyone will complain, so it's shaping up to be a nice night. 

It is at this point that the bride runs downstairs, sobbing, wearing only a robe. Note that the main staircase of the hotel wraps around the front desk, so we're the first to see anyone coming down that way. There was a secondary staircase, but hardly anyone used it to get to the first floor because the main staircase was much nicer and also really beautiful. I'm pretty sure the second staircase was only added due to fire policy. 

Of course, I'm rather alarmed at this sudden turn from the relaxed and happy lady I saw about fifteen minutes prior, and start urgently asking what's wrong while she tries to tell me through crying. Some members of the wedding party are drifting over, and the party itself starts to stop as everyone realizes something's wrong. The coworker who was still partying runs downstairs to get Natalie and the others, who are up in a few minutes as I figure out from the bride that one of the wedding guests cornered her and her husband in her room, is currently threatening her husband, and the exceptional groom had managed to get the guy to corner him so that she could run out. And she'd just come out of the shower, hence the robe.

The island did have law enforcement, if you could call it that. They had one of four vehicles on the island (a police cruiser, fire truck, ambulance, and one large construction truck, which I think was only there temporarily due to storm damage on the road around the island). There were two of them and I think one's name was Bill. I did not have a security guard, because as far as my hotel was concerned, I was security (it was way too far out to be feasibly robbed, and other than this incident, I never had to flex my muscles as security). I asked if she wanted me to call them, she said yes, so I did. But it would take a few minutes to get up here since the roads weren't really meant for vehicles beyond the horse drawn carriages and bikes. 

Coworker Natalie is talking to the bride now, being her usual awesome self, and offers to give her a tour of the employee only areas of the hotel, namely the boiler rooms and old basement where they live. Excellent distraction from the current situation, and she agrees, so Natalie and the roommates take her downstairs both to get her to calm down a little without so many people around (we had a crowd) and to try to give her something else to focus on (the old basement WAS pretty cool). I, meanwhile, grab an umbrella from the umbrella stand, just in case, and head upstairs, with about half the crowd following me. We gathered further posse members as we head down the hall to the room with the guy. 

Luckily I did not have to flex my security muscles OR use my umbrella, as two of the guests did not take kindly to this turn of events and took it upon themselves to remove the guy from the room. The husband was, thankfully, unharmed, but obviously pretty shaken. The guests manage to corral the guy back outside with promises of beer and pretend sympathy, and I bring the guy back down to where his wife is back up at the desk. The cops showed up about five minutes later, at which point she told them she didn't want to press charges, she just wanted the guy out of the hotel for the night. He wasn't super pleased about that, but I was trying to reassure the rest of the party that everyone was unharmed and I didn't see how they got him in the car. His girlfriend went too.

It is at this point, talking to the guests, that I learn the following:
1. This man was not drunk. At all. He's just Like That.
2. Half the guests don't even know the guy. This is a little weird until I learn that:
3. His girlfriend was the OFFICIANT of the wedding, a friend of a friend, and he's her plus one. Of the half who knew who he was, about half of THEM had actually met him before, and all of those who had;
4. Were very concerned about his girlfriend because they thought he was abusing her. I cannot say that this thought was not also on my mind, but the girlfriend was insistent that she was fine and had to go with him, even as we tried to tell her that it was just him who had to leave and she was welcome to stay.

Evidently the guy heard, or thought he heard, the groom talking shit. The groom allegedly either said that the guy was abusing his girlfriend (if he hadn't said this, many other people at the party were by the time all this went down, so good going, genius) or had insulted his military service. (Note; the groom insists he said nothing of the sort to either, and I am inclined to believe him). The guy decided that apparently they had to be Taught A Lesson, and took the secondary staircase up to their room once they'd gone up for the evening to corner them and threaten to bust kneecaps. If the party guests didn't think he was hitting his girlfriend before, they were dead certain of it now, from what I gathered while talking to people.

Surprisingly, once he was gone, the party actually kept going, slightly more low key. Everyone else was a very cheery drunk. The bride and groom were obviously pretty upset to have had their wedding night interrupted by an asshole who didn't even have the decency to be a drunk, but we had some platters of chocolate covered strawberries for tomorrow's guests so I gave them those and some champagne and texted my own roommate, who worked in the kitchen, to let her know that the morning staff would have to replace the strawberries, sorry for that. Party wound down at about one AM and the next night, Natalie told me that the cops had come back up during the day before the bride checked out to make sure she didn't want to press charges (still a no, she is a more stalwart woman than I.) 

The moral of this story is that if you are invited to the wedding of people you barely know because your girlfriend is an ordained minister, and you think you might've heard someone talking shit, keep it to yourself.",62,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF53F280>
83,"Think that you cool, but you ain't got a crown(NSFW Language)","Be schemin' and thirstin' 'cause I stepped away now

Lookin at the taps, like you want a beer...

WHAT THE FUCK?!

Alternate Title:  ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Audacity of this Bitch.""

This is like to be a fairly short tale, as it just happened and I'm still a bit stunned, to be honest.

Our tale begins, like most others do, at a hotel.  A hotel where the daywalkers are daywalkers, and are complete morons at times.  (That line is what we in the story telling game call ""foreshadowing"".)  A hotel where we sell alcohol.

The first sign that this was going to be a pain in the ass of a night came when there was a run on beer just before midnight.  But no one seemed too inebriated.  Certainly not enough that I had to deny any sales.  Just a group of coworkers engaging in the time honored tradition of having a couple beers before bed while on a road trip.  No harm, ultimately.  But I hate having to interact with people, so it was annoying.  Like, it's midnight.  Go to bed.  The show's over.  What are you still doing here?

A couple of them came back in a bit later trying to convince me to sell them more beer, which I declined, offering to sell them anything from our fine collection of horrifically overpriced sodas and waters.

Well, perhaps an hour or so later, I get a call from up on our highest floor.  Someone's being loud in a room.  Okay fine.  I don't have security tonight, so I guess I need to secure the front desk and head up to see what I can hear, and confront the noisy party should it be loud enough that I deem it an issue.

I go up and stand in the hall for 3-4 minutes.  Hear people talking, but it's soft enough that I can't even make out what they're saying.  Certainly not enough to confront anyone about.  So I head back downstairs.  Total time gone was no more than 5, maybe 6 minutes.

As I enter the lobby, what do I see but a man reaching over the bar and serving himself a fucking beer from the tap?

I heard a record scratch in my mind.  I smelled burnt hair.  And I'm pretty sure tiny lightning bolts arced across my eyes.  Then my mouth spoke, unbidden by my brain, which was still rebooting.

*Auditor.exe has crashed.  Running operations using backup system AngerIssues.bat*

""What the actual FUCK do you think you're doing?"" I exclaimed.

""I, uh, just wanted a beer..."" he mumbled.

""You just wanted a fucking beer?  I told you over an hour ago that we were no longer serving those.""  I snatched the glass from his hand and poured it out.  ""Now we're going to go over to my computer and you're going to pay for that, and you're going to thank whatever God you pray to that I'm not calling the cops on you right now.  Because I fucking should.  And if I EVER see you pull that shit again, I will do it in a heartbeat.  They will arrive to find you twitching on the floor, covered in your own pee after I tase your ass.  What the fuck is wrong with you?  Just thinking you can walk up and serve yourself a fucking beer.  For fuck's sake.""  I continued muttering like that the whole way to the front desk.

So, you might be asking at this moment, ""Hey, Pold, why didn't you call the cops?""

And that's a damn good question.  Well, the reason for that is thus:  Auditor.exe had finished rebooting, and had loaded the supplemental WhatConsequencesDoIFace.dll.  Because I wasn't sure just how much trouble we could be in for the fact that he was even able to do that.  You see, those taps are supposed to be locked.  And they would be, if my coworkers weren't window licking morons.

So, you know, I didn't want to be the idiot who got our million plus dollar liquor license revoked.  I similarly didn't kick him out because I didn't want to call the cops to remove him if he argued, because that whole thing might have come up.

But you bet your ass I marked down his name for my boss to add him to the DNR.  It's not impossible that his whole company may be contacted and added to the list.

Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to go do a download in hopes that AngerIssues.bat will stop running in the background once I've dropped the kids off at the pool.  And don't worry, I located the tap locks(well, most of them, one was missing) and did what my restaurant people should have done hours ago.",13,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF53F2E0>
84,My first inappropriate guest,"I’ve been hit on/made inappropriate comments towards by guests since I started this job, I’m used to it, I’m good at deferring, not my first rodeo… but we have a long term guest that is above and beyond for me I wanted to share.

He’s a worker, he’s been staying with us for a couple weeks and will here for another month.  He would frequently sit in the lobby so I became familiar with him.  One day he sat and talked to me during my night shift for 2 hours.  He kept asking for my social media so he could talk to me when he was lonely, to which I responded I don’t give out my personal information.  

That night, before I could even get home, this man somehow found me on Instagram and started sending me messages.  I just ignored them thinking it was a one time thing… this man messages me multiple times a day how sad he is he can’t talk to me.  This has been going for 5 days without a response.

When I am not there, he asks my coworkers where I am.  When I am there, he asks me why I won’t talk to him on Instagram, and gets offended when I have to actually work.  He once sat and waited for me to finish one task and appear to become actually upset when I have to do something else or talk to another guest. 

This is a type of behavior that I never thought I’d have to deal with at a job, but I guess this is my lesson to appear like I’m busy even during the quiet hours of the night… I even started bringing a book with me now.",24,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF53F340>

\-Not having any cocaine or knowing where to get cocaine

\-Suggesting a guest buy beer at a gas station about 150 feet away from the hotel because we don't sell alcohol

\-Not having a microwave in the breakfast area

\-Not having a TV Guide.  Like, the old magazine.

\-A wet floor sign being where the floor was wet (yes, seriously)

\-Getting a cup of coffee as they walked up to the desk.

\-Not accepting a bag of weed as a method of payment.",311,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF53F3A0>
86,The Only Uber Driver,"Oh my god I’m so glad this exists. I have FUN STORIES FROM THE NIGHT AUDIT, y’all, but this one had a fun twist, so.....

Over the summer I was working the night audit at a very remote hotel in a very rural and low density state. We were 20 minutes out from the nearest town, which was in turn an hour from the only city of any real note, which on most of the east coast would be like, a very small city or one of those suburbs that grew up. We hosted a lot of weddings, usually doing both ceremony and reception, but sometimes we’d wind up booked up and any late planning guests would have to book a place in town. 

One night I get a call at 3 am from a Very drunk woman. At first I think she’s asking me about hotels in town (and explain that I don’t know anything about them), then whether we have any rooms (no we do not, I’m very sorry), and finally manage to piece this together; she went with some friends, other wedding guests, back to their bed and breakfast in the town. Presumably she took their car. Now they have all fallen asleep and she wants to go back to the hotel.

It’s me and a single security guard on duty. Neither of us can leave, much less for a 40 minute round trip to pick up a woman I think I can hear gagging in the bushes. 

Apologize profusely and all that, ask how she got there (her friends are now asleep), can she stay with them for the evening (she’s outside and they’re asleep), why can’t she wake them up (never got a clear answer on that one). She’s getting more and more whiny and adamant that there’s no Ubers in our, and this is a paraphrase because I don’t remember exactly what she called it but it was more or less “podunk nowhere fuckin state”.

So I hung up. I told my manager the next morning, I did not get in trouble. I go to get breakfast. Given the remote location, employees mostly lived on site, so we all ate together, and I’m getting ready to regale the morning server crew with my story and barely get two words in when one of them goes “THE LADY WHO WANTED AN UBER?!?”

Apparently, her sister lives in town, and is the only Uber driver for about fifty miles, so every time this lady called Uber (many, many, many, MANY times) she kept getting the same person, who quite understandably didn’t think that the Uber fare was worth getting up and dressed at 3 am to ferry a very drunk woman back to the hotel.

My boss thought this was all very funny. I never did find out if she got back.",28,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF53F400>
87,Police calling etiquette when working FD,"Hey guys. Not sure if this kind of post is allowed, but hopefully if it isn’t someone can answer me before it gets removed

When you guys call police to have a guest removed, do you call 911 or do you call the station? I’m afraid they’d get pissed and not see it as an emergency worth dialing 911 over.

Last week we had a dude who wasn’t willing to wait for his refund to be posted to his account and was demanding money IMMEDIATELY and getting so angry I was worried he’d destroy the lobby that I almost called for backup but luckily my manager fixed the situation. 

TLDR: I’ve only worked in this hotel for a couple months and would like to know what’s acceptable when calling police to remove a guest",49,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF53F460>
88,Night & Audit Torture,"A couple of disclaimers before we start:
* Names of guests and properties are aliases for privacy reasons and to comply with subreddit rules.
* Names of websites also aliased to comply with other subreddit rules.

So, as I type this, I'm near the end of my night audit shift and, well, I basically wanna kick something. Between a surprisingly dense flow of check-ins tonight, including a bunch of last-minute bookings; always assume that ""8 rooms to sell"" will turn into ""8 more arrivals"", people making their hotel naivete obvious by pressing me about the incidentals deposit, adding a bunch of last-minute snack purchases to their check-in as if to ""but wait there's more"" me, and in general people bugging me for things constantly even past midnight when I normally do not expect much activity from guests and even when I'm trying to eat (as the sole employee on duty at the motel, I don't have a fixed lunch break), this shift has felt less like ""night audit"" and more like ""second shift but it's dark outside."" And I *have* worked second shift a few times.

**Exhibit A: bUt I AlReaDy pAiD FoR tHe RoOm**

So in comes this guest, who I'll call Chad Chucklefuck. This guest has stayed with us at least five times in the past and he always books directly through our website rather than Shitepedia or HotTrashTonight or some other gods-forsaken third-party booking site, so I assume he's familiar with our policies and procedures. And when guests book directly, they don't pay in advance; we only collect payment when they check in.

When he tries to check in, I ask to see his ID and a credit card for the incidentals deposit, to which he responds, ""but I already paid for the room!""

Now, normally, that phrase, which I hold in my head as worse than ""cunt"", comes from the lips of people who booked prepaid reservations through those third-party Online Travel Agency (OTA) sites, in hopes that paying for the room in advance exempts them from providing incidentals, something that in their years of staying at hotels they supposedly have never had to provide ever. But there's an equally frustrating other purpose for these words, exhibited here by Chad. I pulled up his folio to confirm that no, there are no pre-existing payments like he claims there are, explaining that we only succ the money from him when he checks in like he is right now.

So Chad leaves to top his card up with money and comes back. But the card declines for the payment and incidentals. Chad offers to pay for the room in cash and the just the incidentals on the card. Yeah no problem, we take cash at check-in, let me just--nope, nah, card still declining even just for the $50 incidentals. 

He goes back into hissyfit ""but I already paid"" mode. I ask him what's his evidence that we charged his card already, and he says he has a confirmation email which he says is proof that he paid for the room. Anyone who's been diligently working a hotel front desk for at least 6 months knows that a confirmation email does not in anyway prove payment, so I ask him to provide a bank statement or something else proving that we somehow collected his money. He doesn't answer my question and just leaves to try to find another ATM, but never comes back for the rest of my shift, so I just cancel his res.
- - - -
**Exhibit B: The OTA Stan**

The poisonous cherry on top of the durian sundae comes in the form of this in-house guest who waltzes into the lobby. We'll call him Bob Bucklefuck. I was assisting another guest who was setting up a walk-in rental with me, we'll call her Alice Aardvark.

So while I'm doing business with Alice, because *she was here first*, Bob reaches for our RipAdvisor and business cards, and starts writing stuff on them. In the midst of this, Bob turns to Alice and basically just starts plugging a bunch of OTA apps/websites like Pooper and Hellpedia, about how she can get all these great deals booking through them.

*Did*, I thought to myself. *Did this fool just ~~stan~~ shill OTAs in front of the last person who wants to hear about them?*

For me to explain *why* I dislike these OTA sites would take several paragraphs, but let's just say that these deals that Bob touts involve catches, such as no choice of room type or a non-refundable, non-cancellable clause. Which inevitably leads to irate guests calling the hotel and OTA agents they call horrible deplorable monsters for not refunding their booking that was stated during the booking process to be nonref once paid for, or for not letting them stay in the Suite†LEGGENDARIA for $50.

I hope Alice doesn't take his advice seriously, otherwise she's probably headed for pain town the next time she tries to rent a room.

89,Guest threatened to harass me all night,"I had a guest come in around 1 am. I got his ID and couldn't find a reservation under his name. When I informed him, he gave me someone elses name. I pulled up the reservation, it was booked through a third party and doesn't have this guys name on it anywhere.

I inform the guest I couldn't check him in without verbal permission or having the [guy on reservation] present.

This dude flips out. Starts yelling at me. Told me that he lied. His name is [name on the reservation] and that his ID is fake. Told me to change the name on the reservation to his. Told me he will have someone call us and pretend to  be [name on reservation]. I informed him again that I could not check him in. He then told me if I don't put him in the room he would stand at the front desk and harass me all night...

I ended up having to call the front desk manager (I work alone) and they backed me up. When I put my manager on speaker. He yells at her and again tells her that he will harass me all night. She told him if he chooses to do that, she will call the local PD and have him removed from the property.

He ended up having me make him his own reservation.

What a jerk. Why do guests think this is okay.
Unfortunately my GM is a pushover and will probably refund him for the night and allow him into the other guys reservation.


Update:
We have a new AGM. He has been here a week. He was my relief today. When he came in, I explained the situation (and left a very detailed pass off note). He told me I did the correct thing by not letting him use the reservation and he would not be giving him a refund. He said from the sounds of it, he doesn't want the guy on our property.
He then told me even if I was in the wrong, he would always have my back. Which felt freaking great to hear. 

I asked him to let me know how it goes when the guy comes back to speak with him.

90,Is it okay if I were to call the police to ask someone to leave?,"I work overnights and the hotel i work at is a few blocks away from a homeless shelter so sometimes we get a lot of crackheads that come in and try to hang out. Well i have had to call the police a handful of times throughout the years to remove people off the property. Most of the time if i tell someone to leave they will try to argue with me that they dont have to leave. So tonight i had a guy in a hoodie outside, i noticed him around midnight and i ended up calling the non emergency police number and asked if they can send an officer out here to ask him to leave. The guy wasn’t doing anything illegal but i know he isn’t a guest and he was listening to music right outside of a guests window. When an officer got here i could tell he was kind of annoyed that i called. He asked me briefly what happened and i just explained i dont know who he is and he was outside of a guests window and he was making me nervous. The officer then said “so he’s not doing anything wrong?”. You could tell from his demeanor that he was annoyed. My question is: Is this something i should call the police over? Can anyone else relate and hopefully provide me with a better solution?",21,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF53F580>

92,And So It Continues...,"This is a rant/update to my last post!

So, I work the double. I text my AM shift that she will have to stay til 5pm on Sunday. Instead of saying ""okay"" she says ""why do I have to stay late?"" in the most snotty tone when she calls me. I explain that I'm working a double, and I need to sleep. She says ""Okay"" and hang up. Cool, cool, cool. That's fine.

My GM arranges someone to take my PM shift. This person is notoriously late. I warn AM shift that it is the late bitch relieving her. I go home and go to sleep.

I wake up at a respectable 2:30pm. I go about my day as per usual. My phone is turned on at 4pm, when my husband and I end up taking separate cars to run 2 different errands, in 2 different parts of the city. When I look at my phone, I have 25 texts in the work group chat and 6 missed calls from my boss. I read the texts. AM shift can't figure out how to make a reservation in a group block. Despite being trained on it in person multiple times. Despite the step by step guide in the damn binder. The calls from GM were her trying to get me to make the reservation and/or teach AM shift (AGAIN) how to do it.

I don't call back or text back. 

At 5:15pm, AM shift starts calling me. I reject her call every time. AM texts me ""I'm leaving. I'm not staying any longer"" I respond with ""Its not me. It's (late bitch). Stop calling me."" And then the little gremlin that lives in my brain and causes all my pettiness said ""take a screenshot and send it to the group."" I did exactly that.

Fucking immediately, my GM responds to me and then she starts calling late bitch. At that point its out of my hands. I leave my phone on, because I'm waiting on a call from a friend about her wedding.

I fall asleep about 10pm, and promptly miss all of the calls from Late Bitch, telling me that NA no-call no-showed. She ended up doing a double. When I wake up and see all of this, I take her shift for today (Monday). After talking to her, my GM calls me. And she rips my ass up for not answering my phone. 

4 hours later, NA gets ahold of GM, after she threatened to fire him. He has to do NA for the rest of the week (including today, which GM was supposed to cover). He also has a room at our hotel inexplicably for a week.

I speak my my GM right before I leave my house for work. She says ""Well, with everything going on, I don't think you'll be able to take next week off.""

My bet is that NA will be 20 minutes late tonight. It wouldn't be the first time he has stayed at the hotel and been late.",19,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF53F640>
93,Guest stayed for sh*ts and giggles...,"Our company has 3 hotels in the city, one larger one that also offers hostel rooms and two smaller ones that only offer single or double rooms because the floor-plan does not allow for larger rooms. 

I work the night shift in the smallest of the three, we only have 60 beds total. The largest one has 900+.

So, this is the tale about a guest who is on a mission. He checked in Tuesday last week, booked one night in a hostel room, checked out during the night-shift of the same night. 

He then came back a few hours later and booked a private room for the next day. Since we were not at capacity, the morning shift was able to give him the key to the room immediately, because we had clean rooms from the night before. We do this regulary when possible, because a) the guest is happy to get access to the room earlier and b) the guest is out of our hair in regards to check in, because as we know, they all arrive exactly at the time we change from morning to afternoon shift. 

In this case, it was a terrible mistake, but almost unavoidable. (I'll come back to the almost later)

Had had already checked into another room before the other people in his old room checked out. They informed the reception that apparently during the night someone left very early and he had apparently shat the bed. And the shower. GM and housekeeping was informed, a message went out to our whats-app group (don't you love them) and the guy was added to our DNR list. Nobody noticed that he was on the arrival and the departure list of that day and that said guest was still / again in the hotel.

The man on a mission checked out during the night (we have a fast checkout system where you just drop your card in a box at the reception and leave, because in our price segment, you pay your whole stay in advance. We don't take deposits for the room, that is in my experience in two different chains not how it is done in Germany. We have a very robust ""Meldewesen"", which means that every citizen has an address registered with the state and you are obligated by law to inform the city when you change addresses. So we rather send a bill and a collection agency instead of taking a deposit.

When his checkout was entered into the system the name rang a bell with the front desk, they checked the room immediately and it was completely wrecked. The bed soaked in urine, the walls smeared with feces, luckily no damage to the furniture or electronics. Just filth everywhere. 

While the GM tried to figure out how he had slipped through the cracks, the guy checked into our second hotel for another night. Somehow communication broke down again, the DNR list did not work and he got access to a third room in 48 hours. You can guess what happened there.

Chaos ensued, the GM was furious, the housekeeping was furious, the front desk was furious.

I woke up to a barrage of text on my phone when I woke up for my night-shift. Since it was a good possibility that would go for the hattrick, I was well aware and prepared and checked ID and registrations for guests even more religiously than I usually do. At around 5 am, I come to the front desk to find a completely disheveled looking human being telling me about a reservation he just made via third party.

The guy looked like he had not slept in days, smelled like he had not showered or even washed himself in weeks and had no luggage. I asked him for his ID card, look and behold it was him. I asked him if this was his current address, he said yes and I informed him that he was forbidden from staying in any hotel of our company ever again and that he was trespassing and I will call the police immediately. He looked very surprised for a second and then bolted out of the hotel like greased lightning. I still had his ID card. So I locked the door, checked all other exits if they were closed and proceeded to disinfect the lobby and the reception and I worked the last 2 hours of my shift in a haze of isopropanol.

When I went home I found another present on the sidewalk in front of the hotel.

I must say, I almost admire the dedication and I hope the man gets the help he obviously needs.

Good news is, we are NOW implementing better lines of communication between the 3 properties and a more robust DNR-list system.

94,The Mysterious Flash Drive...," 

I worked a front desk in my early 20's. I discovered one of the managers was running a prostitution ring out of the hotel, and it was like she wanted me to find out...

I worked for a small Hotel with a few run down locations in my city. They paid just above minimum wage and had taken the chair away from the front desk person so you could only stand. The kind of place that would accuse the most honest person of stealing from the till or eating the precious continental breakfast food.

One day one of the managers mentioned that she had a very important flash drive in the computer, and to not let her leave without it. She made repeated comments about this flash drive, and even said ""it's not for your virgin eyes"". Of course she had intentionally picqued my curiosity and despite my attempts to remind her, she left the drive.

I may have waited a good 10 minutes before checking and realizing she left it, but upon opening it I was certainly surprised. There was a folder marked ""entertainers"" and inside were scantily clad or fully nude women with names like Candy, Vegas and Sinthia - all with out of state phone numbers and prices for services listed.

I started to notice some of these women under their real names coming in and checking in with special rates. Tbh, I didn't really care that they were running a prostitution ring, just pissed that there was all this money going around and they're arguing with me about whether or not I ate a bowl of cereal from the continental breakfast.

I never confronted anyone on it, just closed the folder and kept going about my business. I ended up walking out of this job, but that wasn't really related to the prostitution ring. Maybe a story for another day...",26,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF53F700>
95,In what world do you think you’ll get checked in at 2am for a 3pm reservation??,"Just had a beautiful lady come to the desk at 2am to ATTEMPT to check in to her 3pm reservation. 
I kindly explained to her that check in starts at 11am with a early check in fee. 3pm no early check in fee. She says she’s been traveling all day so she NEEDS to go to bed. I let her know her only option would be to book a room for tonight. Could totes keep her in the same room for her whole stay. As I gesture I offer to take off the resort fee because I can tell she is upset. 
Reluctantly she agrees. I quote her the price and let her know about the security deposit. She then claims she’s never had to put down a deposit at any hotel. (Yeah, ok sure) 
After the transactions are done she asks for my managers name. I give it to her and she says nothing. Starts to complain that she will never stay with us ever again (that would be a blessing). Says she feels like she’s getting ripped off. (shoulda made a reservation for the night ahead of time) Make her the keys and let her know about wifi. She asks for the managers name again and I give it to her and ask if she would like to speak to her. Then she says I should have gotten her in the first place???? (Sorry I’m not a mind reader) My patience is low at this point and I say you never asked. But offer to get her FOR A THIRD TIME. She says nothing. I hand her the keys and give her directions to the elevator and she responds with “I know where I’m at.” Lol cool cool how about you figure out your check in times next, weirdo.",35,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF53F760>
96,I work alone during the graveyard shift and a guest was...unhappy that I had to use the bathroom. This is an email I just sent the management and is the first time I've ever made a record about a rude guest. Tired of assholes walking all over us and being compensated for every asshole complaint.," Dear FOM,

FYI I stepped out to use the restroom and while I was in the restroom I could hear someone aggressively and loudly ringing the bell nonstop at the front desk.  I came out to the front desk as quickly as I could and **\[guest name\]** in **\[room number\]** was there.  She was quite upset and was behaving in a rude manner by raising her voice as she demanded to know why no one was at the front desk.  I informed her that I was the only one working and had been in the restroom and showed her the sign next to the bell that says, “Front desk clerk will return in a few moments.”  She claimed that I hadn’t put the sign up, but the camera roll will show that I did.  She told me I should be at the front desk at all times and that she had called many times from her room.  I responded that I was sorry for the inconvenience but I have to step out to use the restroom periodically.

She asked for a wakeup call for 0800 then said again, quite rudely, that she didn’t believe I was in the restroom and that I must have been sleeping.  I told her I could hear her ringing the bell many times from the bathroom and that I tried to come as quickly as possible.  She walked away and yelled back to me, “How can I believe you!” and left.

I am informing you of this incident in case there are further incidents or escalations with this guest.  Her demeanor was quite hostile and bordering on harassment so I want to make a record of her behavior in case it continues.",90,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF53F7C0>
97,Stay at a hotel & lose your ability to read,"Entering a hotel seems to magically erase everyone's ability to read. We've been short staffed since the pandemic hit, so the FD has been helping with laundry and running breakfast in the mornings. Every day, guests will ignore the huge yellow sign placed in the center of the counter that says, ""For assistance please pick up phone and dial 0,"" which will call the cordless phone. I'll be folding laundry and hear ""HELLO?!"" from the lobby. Every. Single. Day.

This morning was a special treat. I happened to actually be at the desk when an older couple came to check out. I asked how they enjoyed their stay. 

Illiterate Woman: ""Well, we had to get our own milk for breakfast.""

(I assumed the milk had run out so the guest had gone out and bought some themselves.)

Me: ""I'm sorry if we ran out. If you had told the front desk, we would have refilled it for you.""

IW: ""No one was here.""

Me: ""Did you try the phone?"" I pointed to the sign right next the phone on the counter.

IW: ""No, I got it myself.""

Me: (It finally clicked.) ""...You didn't go into the kitchen, did you?""

IW: ""Well, yes! No one was here and the milk was gone.""

So this bitch ignored the phone sign on the counter, ignored the Employees Only sign on the kitchen door, and somehow decided it was okey dokey to grab whatever she wanted from the refrigerator. Just read the signs ffs!!!",27,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF53F820>
98,YOU ARE NOT GETTING A REFUND,"Phone rings

Fd- hello thanks for calling how can i help ypu??? 

Reservation hotline- (i can barley understand him. Sounds korean or Chinese, def not the usual indian guy i get). yes we were calling about .... and they would like to know about canceling without penalty? Check in 3-11 check out 3-12. 

(They called the day after and today i already lothe those hotline people they are way too pushy and always try to get you to go aginst hotel policy) 

The first time they called i couldn't find anything under that name or number. Then finally found it and low and behold they didnt check out till the next day. 

I look into it and see whats going on. 

Fd- yes due to the guest checking into the room on 3-11 and not checking out till 3-12 that request has been denied. 

Anyone who checks into the room snd stays more than 30 min will be charged for a full night stay.

 The room wasn't checked out till the next day and they did not speak with anyone at the desk before leaving.

 , so request is denied due to hotel policy. If they wish to speak to the gm he will be here atound 4pm today. 

As of right now we will not approve that ans this matter is finished as of right now. Thanks have a nice day. 

Res hotline- ok we will let them know its denied. 

Yea knowing that you stayed there for several hours youre not getting a refund. 

If you dont say anything to the desk clerk then i cant help you. We always tell each other what happened om shift. If you didnt say you was leaving and or was unhappy i cant help you. 

Just another ploy for people to try and get free hotel rooms. 

I dont mean to sound rude or unhelpful but its still a business. The owner still has bills and payroll to deal with. 

So no you are NOT getting money back. 😒",4,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF53F880>
99,Guest debating me about our pet policy,"Last night around 10:45pm, had a guest checking in, booked the reservation from a third-party site - was not prepaid.  He came to check-in and starts asking me about the pet policy.

I tell him, we allow dogs only, and it's $10 in addition to the day.  He says ""well online it says the hotel is pet friendly"" and I say ""yes that's right, but we still need to charge you for the dog."" 

""But it doesn't say there is a charge.""  

""There is however, unless it's a service animal."" (I point to our little ""pet policy"" sign)

""(The website) didn't tell me I would be paying more.""

This interaction went on for a whole five minutes and I was tired of the back & forth, at which point I go:

""We'll comp the charge for the dog on this stay, but for future reference there is a dog fee.""

""Oh well I don't have my dog with me today, I was just curious.""

100,"Human Backwash demands a room we don't have availability for, then calls me a liar for being sold out mid-week","NA for just a little under a year now at a relatively small hotel (under 200 rooms) in a small city. This happened tonight (Sunday night). I get a get a phone call at 3:30 in the morning. It's a guy (I'll call HB for Human Backwash) asking to make a reservation. I get the dates down and then ask him what room type he wants. He wants a King suite, but we don't have any available. In fact, for that date, a tuesday, we only have ONE double queen room available. I tell him that, he has me check Wednesday, no suites, but single kings and double queens. ""ALL those suites and NONE of them are available *mid-week?*"" I tell him we only have 4 suites on-site, so they sell out pretty quickly. 

HB then demands a scenic-facing top-floor room. Both scenic-facing and top-floor are by request only, never guaranteed. Management has a FIT when you guarantee that shit, because 99% of the time they're already blocked to Elites, and won't be available. I tell him they're not guaranteed, by request only, blah blah blah, and he just repeats ""Make me a reservation for a top-floor scenic-facing room"" as if my response will suddenly change. When it doesn't, HB gets mad at me and says ""Well it IS guaranteed if I make a RESERVATION for it, *isn't it???*"" I tell him the only thing you can reserve is a room with a certain bed type. You CANNOT reserve a floor or a scenic-facing side.

Then he goes full Karen and asks ""Transfer me to your general manager."" I tell him the GM isn't in-house right now but I can take contact info down and have my GM contact him. (It's fucking 3:30am dude. On a weekend. And he's mentioned that it's 3:30am in my town previously, so he's AWARE.) ""If he isn't there, I want his personal cell phone number because *I want to speak to him NOW.*"" I repeat that I can take contact info down, pass it onto management, and my GM will contact him. HB gets upset again and tells me ""Take this message down for him"" and basically his message is 'tell your gm to make me a reservation for Tuesday for the king suite I already told him we don't have, and also, he wants the top-floor scenic-facing one specifically.' Ugh. I ignore his blatant disregard of anything I just told him and gleefully tell him I'll pass the message onto my GM as soon as he gets in in the morning (I wrote it in our daily pass-down report so everyone can read it and laugh at him), and ask him again for ""a name and contact info"". He tells me a phone number. ""Understood, sir, is there a name you would like to include?"" HB reluctantly gives me his name and spells it out REAL slow like he's speaking to an idiot. 

So I write it down and tell him I'll be sure to pass that on and is there anything else I can do to help? He goes on this tirade about how I MUST be lying to him and says ""I don't believe you, it's impossible for a hotel to be sold out mid-week. People are *working* in the middle of the week."" I tell him we do get a lot of business travelers, who are of course working while they're traveling, so that might help explain it. He then demands a bunch of statistics I don't have and information I'm not supposed to give him, and claims I'm definitely lying because I won't give him that info, then hangs up on me. Cool. That's gonna be a fun complaint for management to hear. It's a good thing I have reasonable management that won't hold some Karen's bullshit behavior against me.",25,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEFE9790>
101,Lessons from Cra-Z-Con: The Lesson on Human Decency,"Another Cra-Z-Con goes by and more lessons are learned. But first, a little background.

Some of you may be familiar with my previous Cra-Z-Con stories. Truly, one of the most chill conventions around. (If not, hopefully some kind soul will take pity on me and link in comments. Stuck on mobile and a busy night). One of the positives is that of Access. Due to a certain combination of  celestial alignments and reputation, the celebs can often be found cheerfully mingling with hotel guests in our Watering Hole. The hotel guests always seemed to understand the difference between a respectful word and being boorish or, in essence, an asshole...

That was until the last one ...

One of the celebs (who was completely exhausted due to travel and health issues) was attempting to have a quick, quiet lunch. We did our part by seating them in an alcove where they'd be unnoticed. It worked... too well

Enter,... Let's call her DB (feel free to guess what it stands for. You're probably right). Like some trailer park tabloid gossip blogger, she starts to (very loudly and drunkenly) hold court as an expert on said celebrity by making snarky comments about appearance and rumors, treating internet rumors as gospel, and generally being a scummy person.

The good news is that staff were on point and, after reasonable methods failed, DB was punted from property. The bad news is that the celebrity, who was a very sweet person, was so embarrassed that they retreated to their room for the night instead of having fun with the rest of us.

Ladies, Gents, and everyone else who haven't declared similar grouping terms yet, this is why we can't have nice things. Being a decent human costs nothing....

102,Had 2 guests check in then proceed to cause over £2500 of damages in 10 minutes,"So we had 2 guests check in around 12:30am, the guests appeared as if though they would be ‘problem guests’ but had a prepaid booking which was a bit of a red herring as generally problem guests would try to pay with cash which we don’t accept on a night.

We got them all checked in smoothly then discovered one of them had left their phone and cigarettes at reception. Once they came to collect and go for a smoke literally 10 mins after checking in my manager had a feeling they had damaged their room as one of them were holding the destroyed handset from the phone in the room.

Upon checking they had bled all over reception, the ground floor and destroyed everything in sight in their room.

This included a few smashed mugs, broken mirrors, the curtains were pulled off the wall as well as the tv being yanked off and somehow bent in half.

The guests had also mysteriously disappeared and when they returned weren’t happy to see that they couldn’t get back to their floor.

Out of spite they then threw a mop at the window and used all the fire extinguishers in sight before leaving through a fire door.

2 hours of cleaning later and multiple phone calls to the police we discovered another hotel had also made a similar complaint about the same guests who have now been arrested

103,Failed Karen laments no one knows customer service anymore,"Disclaimer: I do not judge people on the basis of their sexuality, or anything else, just their attitude--I'm just trying to be clear in my story.

I've been working audit for the last 3 weeks or so as we struggle to find a replacement. Around 2AM last Thursday a guy came in and had attitude right from the start. While clearly gay I'm not sure if he was on hormones or if/what stage of transition he's in but I'm just saying it sounds like he is. He asks for quotes for a range of rooms which we mostly have as we aren't that busy. He settled on a 2 queen room after sighing and eye-rolling as I stated each rate.

I start to process the room and he says he needs it for a week and if we have a weekly rate and yes we do. I tell him per training that if he leaves before the week is up the rate reverts to RACK and he says ""what does that mean?"" I explain it to him and he says ""well that's retarded--ugh!--whatever."" I ask if he wants the room and he says yes ""I guess"".

So he runs the card and it declines. I tell him this and he says ""wtf, try it again I just transferred money."" It declines again. He asks me the rate again and I tell him and he says ""that's not what you said before."" I did, actually, and repeated it to him again slowly. He fiddled on his phone for a few more moments muttering ""do you even know what you're doing?"" So I tried it again and it went through. I was really hoping it wouldn't so I could make up a lie like your card is locked out of our system or whatever.

I made keys and he went to his room. Later that night around 4AM I headed to the laundry room to get some linens and I noticed his door was ajar, lights off. The door latch was in the doorway and the door right up to it so not completely locked and someone could just walk right in. That is a security concern so I wondered if I should turn around and call the room to see if everything is OK. I take a few steps past the door and I hear someone open it then close it quickly after and latch the door. I assume thats the guest so I don't worry about it further.

This same thing happened the next 2 nights--I'd walk by and the door during random AM hours and it would be similarly ajar and someone would close the door every time I walked past. I didn't notice any odd traffic or anything like that so was a bit puzzled. Also the guest was seen during those days so he wasn't like hurt or anything and no noise complaints etc. so I just shrugged it off.

On the 4th day he amended his checkout day 3 days early and threw a fit when the rate automatically adjusted to RACK from the 7DAY rate. I discussed his reservation with my GM prior and made it clear that I advised him of the potential rate change and that he agreed and made the reservation. He went through the usual lies and when that failed called my GM a bitch and and this and that.

He made an RBF and rested his chin on a middle finger and said ""you can keep this for free"" in an annoying voice. My GM said ""you can shove that up your ass."" The guy acted genuinely surprised and said ""you can't talk to people like that."" My GM gave him a stern warning and he left clutching his pearls.

He checked out and while my manager was lenient with him (I would have DNRd him) initially he was in fact DNRd. He propped open one of the back doors and various men came to/from the room. I felt dumb I didn't catch any of that but I didn't. He also had an undeclared pet which he similarly snuck through the back door and didn't bother cleaning up after.

He came in around 1AM that night and asked he if could reinstate his reservation AND apply the 7DAY rate if he stayed 3 more nights. I said no once you check-out that folio is settled and any new check-in is an entirely new folio. He said in a bothered voice ""But I have a very important business meeting later today so I need a place to stay."" I felt like asking him, when at 4AM? He plopped down his ID and I took it and informed him he was DNRd.

He said ""from that bitch earlier right?"" I didn't say anything and he said ""this place used to be nice, what happened to your customer service? You ALL need to be trained again in customer service fucking shithole hotel"" and walked out.",33,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF53FD60>

105,"""What If She Doesn't Have Her ID?""","This just took place.

A man walks in, tells me he's here to check in and gives me his name.  I recall his name from an earlier phone call that he placed to our hotel this evening to confirm his reservation, except the reservation is under his wife's name, not his.  I remember asking him if his wife is with him because she'll need to be the one to check in since it's under her name.  He answers ""yes, she's with me; we'll be there shortly.""  I think, great, no fuss, no muss.

So when he tells me his name and then says it's under his wife's name, I ask the same question I asked over the phone -- is she here?  He tells me she's in the car, and wanted to make sure that everything was okay before she came in.  I think, ""I confirmed that we had the reservation over the phone."", but I say, ""I just need her with her ID to check you in.""  He mumbles under his breath, starts combing through a pouch he's carrying supposedly looking for HER ID as if I was just going to take it without HER being in front of me.  I was standing there thinking of a way to break it to him when he asked, ""What if she doesn't have her ID?""  Without skipping a beat, I returned the volley, and asked, ""Are you going to the airport?""  He replied yes, and I asked, ""Well, won't she need to have it at the airport?  I mean she might be going back home or staying here with us if she doesn't have it.""  He mumbled something, turned to walk away, then turned back and asked if he could check in on line.  I told him he certainly could, and to just request a mobile key that will be sent to the phone.  He told me that he'll have to download the app.  ""Okay.  Yeah, just use your phone as your key once you do. Have a good night.""

Cut to him and his wife (I suppose) coming back in and standing at my front desk to ask about our shuttle service, and to ask me when they should be receiving their key.  At that same moment I receive a notification to process a mobile request.  Guess whose?  I actually had to check them in, validate the request and send the key.  Whatever.  They had to come into the hotel to go up to the room anyway, so why not just show me the ID?  They could have been in their room a whole 20 minutes earlier.  They wasted time downloading an app, setting everything into motion, just to ultimately wait for me to validate the key vs. just showing me ID.   It was booked on points so I'm not going to die on this hill about them circumventing getting into their room.  If they had to swipe a card, then I would have stuck to my guns.  But points?  Meh.  You've already paid, so have a good night.

I just wanted to share this with you all because I thought it was such a strange little power struggle that this guest wanted to have lol.  I hope he feels victorious when he lays his head down tonight lol.",17,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF5AAA60>
106,I messed up,"So... Last night I messed up. Basically I left money on sight on the front desk without supervision and then a guest saw it. He could have stolen it. Instead he told the Reception manager the next morning what he saw. 

I'm night audit. Last night I received the cash from the Restaurant Departament and then left it on the Reception desk. I didn't save it on our safe box. I saw an error in a guest dinner's bill and went on to look for the Restaurant Manager before he headed home forgetting the money at the Reception desk. It wasnt exactly on plain sight but the guest must have entered the reception to retrieve his keys, since I wasnt around. 

When I came back I realised I had left the money there and thought how stupid I was but nothing more. The day after (tonight) , when I come to work, one of my colleagues tells me that a guest informed the manager. 

Should I speak to my manager? Or do I wait until she calls me?

I'm such an idiot for leaving cash unattended

PD sorry for the bad english

EDIT: Thank you guys for all the support and advice. I did speak to my manager. She told me that she wasn't even going to mention it to me. She thought that there was a proper justification and that it might have been a one-time thing, plus the guest should not have entered our work area. She appreciated that I talked to her. She said mistakes happen, just try to be more careful next time. 

I'm so relieved! I'll make sure I don't make the same mistake ever again.",21,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF5AAAC0>
107,I hate the guests that force their responsibilites onto me,"I'll start with the issue that is currently happening

A guest just checked in and calls down,

""Can you give me an Iphone charger?""

""Im sorry, but I don't think we have one.""

""Well can you look?""

I had a line forming behind the desk so I told her I would call her back if I found one

I had like 8 people checking in and there was a long line forming so I totally forgot about this guest

She then calls back and I tell her that I do not have a Iphone charger

She then says, ""Will you be able to get one?""

Like tf? I told her I was the only one at the desk so I doubt it. Like girl go to the store and get one. I am sorry you forgot your phone charger but it isnt my responsibility to find you one. She called me first at like 7pm then again at 7:30 she could of got in her car (I gave her a parking pass) and go to the store and be back in that time.

I also hate the guests that want me to call them a cab and now it is my responsibilty to get them there on time. Like I am just calling the local cab company it isnt as advanced as uber so there is no real eta they might tell me that it will be 10 mins but with traffic you never know. I then get angry guests glarring at me, pacing the lobby or coming up to me multiple times to call the cab company for an ETA. How bout you get your on cab and get off my back lol

I also also hate the guests that I tell them that our garage as a certain clearance and they decide to book anyways and try to make it my responsibilty to find a spot for their monster truck. Find a spot on the street and get off my back!

I also also also hate the guests that book the wrong room type and make it my responsibilty to magically turn their room into a 2 queen bed room. I aint Harry potter, and I aint no Mary poppins so it aint gonna happen. I get that accidents happen or plans change but you booked that room type so you get that room. Dont come up to me with an attitude and trying to shift the responsibility/blame onto me.

I think thats it rant over.

108,"If you are a front desk agent, you are not human!! You should NOT be allowed to use the restroom!!!","WELL I GUUUEEESSS… We should NOT have feelings!!!… let alone have to use the restroom from time to time!! 

(Obviously I’m being sarcastic). I tend to drink a lot more water at work than when I’m at home lol… this is a good thing… and a bad thing (I suppose). 

I ran to the restroom really really quickly…  I came back to a really angry guest saying he’s been waiting 15 minutes (while also calling the hotel phone with his cell phone)… Sir NO! NO! NO! you were here MAYBE MAYBE MAYBE  3-4 mins because it probably takes me longer to wash my hands than anything… but he still requested my name and my GMs business card. 

I wish I had the perfect response for these inconsiderate jerks :( but all I came up with was “I really do apologize I’m the only one here and had to run to the ladies room but I DON’T believe I was gone for for 15 mins” (I most definitely wasn’t)… “but hello, how are you, what’s the last name on the reservation…” he was unbelievably upset. (Like I just ran over his favorite dog, upset)… 

We are still human people!!

109,My Stuff is so Shiny!,"There are some hotels, somewhere, who get the occasional shiny member here or there, and have plenty of shiny things for them. Upgrades, water, late checkout, you name it!

And then there’a my property. 

At a resort town with prime location, we attract Shiny folks like crazy.  Problem is, none of them ever realize there are *gasp* Other. Shiny. Members. 

Actually, I take that back.  We do have some smart ones who use their upgrades at our properties in advance to guarantee a suite.  They typically are repeat guests, so we also get to know them year over year.  

Right now, it is Spring Break.  It’s basically Spring Break from the beginning of March until mid-April.  If the house of mouse has peak pricing, you can bet other resort areas will be slammed as well.  Our occupancy has been at 100% for almost the whole winter with no downtime due to pent up travelling desires from the last 2 years, too. And right now, the house is filled to the brim with shiny sparkles. 

Despite all this, we still get guests who come to check in and get mad at us when we check them into the room they paid for.  They “always get upgraded omg why are you being so rude don’t you know I’m SO VERY SPARKLY?!”  And then we have to tell them all suites are totally sold out for the foreseeable future and if they want a suite next year they should book the room they desire while making the reservation.  It goes over oh so well. 

Luckily, I’ve been spending more of my time back at my home at Concierge, so I don’t have to deal with this nearly as much. Instead, I get “EXCUSE ME HI THE FRONT DESK SAID WE NEEDED RESERVATIONS CAN I HAVE A RESERVATION FOR SUPER POPULAR RESTAURANT TONIGHT AT 7PM FOR FOURTEEN AND A BABY IM IN ROOM 4XX I NEED IT TONIGHT great bye”

Spring Break, amirite?",38,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF5AABE0>
110,7 to 8 Prostitutes,"We were having a pretty typical albeit busy Sunday after a sold out Saturday. The GM sat down to have her lunch and check her emails when she found an email regarding a customer complaint that had come in through corporate.

A woman complained to corporate that there wasn't a room available so she had to wait to be checked in, and that the room she was checked into was dirty, with sheets that had not been changed. She also claimed that there were 7 to 8 prostitutes at the hotel, and that she felt unsafe at the hotel so she asked staff for a refund. She then said the person who was working directed her to call Ricewine, and Ricewine directed her to call corporate.

That's a lot of claims being made, so we set about looking into the veracity of her complaint. Almost immediately we found the first lie. She complained about having to wait to check in because a room wasn't ready. However the GM distinctly remembered her checking in. Housekeeping was still working so we hadn't had the most up to date list of what was available so the person at the desk asked the GM to run and check the room. The room was about twenty feet from the desk so the GM ran over and confirmed it was clean. The FD then checked the woman in. So the woman was complaining about waiting 1 minute for her room? Oh, this was also at 2:45, fifteen minutes before check in time.

We contacted the FD who had been working to see if she remembered the woman complaining at all. She said she hadn't, she'd just turned the keys in a few hours after checking in and said she'd only needed the room for a few hours to rest before continuing her trip.

We're not sure about the prostitutes. They're either entirely fictional, or the complainant saw some women in mini skirts and felt the need to clutch her pearls. I'm leaning towards entirely fictional myself.

The GM responded to the complaint pointing out the inaccuracies with her claim, and informed her that she'd be receiving no compensation, and would not be welcome back. I guess the lady expected corporate to just give her a free night without actually checking what happened.",56,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF5AAC40>
111,Canceled Paris Flight,"Friday night was busy to say the least. First it’s spring break season and we had a ton of people staying the night before their flight, and then at about 8pm we get a rush because the flight to Paris is canceled. It was mechanical so the airline gave out vouchers, but we don’t really have a contract with the airline. I get this one person who comes down and demand we take his voucher. I explained that his voucher is for the off site hotel near us, but not in the terminal. We cannot take this voucher because it’s not for us. He then wants us to issue a voucher for our hotel. I explained that the airline is the one responsible for issuing the voucher. His response was that since we’re located in the terminal we should be able to just issue home a voucher. I told him we have as much power over the airline as the McDonalds and Starbucks located inside the terminal and he must speak with the airline over his voucher. If he wants to stay with us he could get a room for $399. 

Now if the airline wants to pay me, and give me flight benefits I’d be happy to help this non guest, but I’m not paid by the airline and I’m not an airline employee. Just because we’re attached to the airport doesn’t change any of that. I swear these are the people who go to McDonalds and are pissed they can’t get a Whopper.",29,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF5AACA0>
112,The early AM meeting right after Daylight Savings,"Every year when we spring forward, I’m reminded of this buffoonery.  This didn’t concern the hotel FD specifically. But it it concern the call center and the spa.

At my last job where I worked for 10 or so years, it was such a large resort that sometimes, you knew names, but didn’t know faces.  We had around 800 people working there. Information and identities became lost sometimes and usually, people only knew each other within their department, or in other departments they worked closely with.  Others were just very social, and out of their way to be known by everybody.  

The director of a whole department on the other side of the property, contacts me and says he wants to schedule a meeting with my team. Says he has some exciting new updates for us.   He had been there for many years, and never really made his identity known to reservation sales, or the spa (besides the occasional email)

It was hard to schedule these things, as we always needed coverage in the call center.  The spa also had its challenges, since they already had people scheduled on the books.  so I suggested I split the team up in two and have him do the meeting in two parts, with lunch.  He declined it.  I suggested he come in days where phones tend to be slower, nope he declined it.  I made various suggestions as to how to do this, and he declined every single thing. 

Finally I get a calendar invite.  Monday morning, 7am.  He’s going to do the meeting an hour before the openers start, so as to “not interfere with coverage.”   Now keep in mind, not everyone started AT 8am.  this was a staggered schedule - you had people who were scheduled at 10am, 11am, etc., and for some people it was their Day off!  so this is particularly inconvenient for anyone who has a commute/has to arrange for kids and other commitments.  

This was also inconvenient for the spa techs, who usually needed that hour to do kind kind of preparation for clients coming in the morning - so essentially they can’t melt wax, they can’t heat up the basalt stones, basically they can’t do shit. This limits the types of services they can do, which ultimately affects their earnings that day (also affected my staff, who couldn’t make commission from upselling) .

Every single alternative was denied outright by this guy.  He insisted up, down, left, and right, that 7am was the way to go.  And it was mandatory, with HR looped in.  Obviously, he didn’t want my input, and I’m not going to win this one. 

Then I realized it.  This guy was making everyone come in an hour earlier than the normal opening shift… which happened to be the first Monday morning, directly after God damn Daylight Savings.  So we had to lose *two* hours of sleep for this guy. 

We had the meeting, it’s still dark out when people are rolling in…. and wouldn’t you know it,  it was literally the most pointless meeting we have ever had.  

On top of everything, he didn’t even offer coffee or bagels or anything.  This was a very large golf resort, and HE was quite literally the GM of the members club on site.  He himself oversaw 2 separate restaurants and catering.  He 100% has the ability to feed everyone, and it would have been no skin off of his ass, but no.  Not even a bagel, donuts, coffee, nothing.  I had to be the one to do all of this last minute 

For the rest of the day I had to deal with pissed off team members who had to wake up at an ungodly hour, after already losing an extra hour of sleep, for the most useless meeting ever that could have literally been an email.  All because of some rich jerkoff who had never even bothered to stop by and say hi one single time. 

 It was the most ridiculous example of corporate dick swinging I have ever seen, and I never forgot it.  Don’t schedule morning meetings after daylight savings.",41,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF5AAD00>
113,"""So We get Screwed.""","At my hotel we have a contract to host the crews for a regional airline. The overwhelming majority of these people are good hard-working people who understand that we are all but cogs in the machine. There are however the few who have forgotten that grinding gears get no deference from the machine. I had one such guest last night.

This interaction actually began over a month ago when I received a call from a pilot requesting that a certain inbound crew be placed in suites. To be exact he asked ""Why does my crew never get any suites?"" I understood the subtext to be accusatory, and so I felt a bit defensive. I explained that all the rooms we assigned to crews were done so with scheduling and cleaning in mind so that they could be clean and ready for the next crew. That the order in which they were doled out was due more to logistics than anything else. 

""So am I getting a suite tonight or what?"" He asked, with an added edge in his tone.

""Let me get some information, and I can tell you,"" I said, and I got the information I needed in order to complete the query. ""As it turns out, sir, your rooms are assigned to standard rooms tonight.""

""So we get screwed then,"" he spat, then promptly hung up. 

I was quite taken aback. There was so much animosity over a room he would end up spending a total of 12 hours in. On the one hand, it wasn't worth it to have a fight, but on the other it would throw the schedule all out of whack to switch rooms between crews. I realized I could just switch their rooms to others that were outside the regular rotation, but then I realized I didn't want to so I didn't.

Fast forward to last night. I'm closing up my shift and my coworker gets a call, from a crew that just landed asking if they could have suites. I instantly thought, 'what are the odds?' I informed her to let them know I we could do it, but they would have to stop by the desk. She looked at me funny, but I told her to trust me.

When they arrived I put on air of exaggerated exuberance that was out of place for quarter to midnight, and began with. ""Hello, Hello! Welcome! I simply must apologize, I did not realize that Suite Guy was coming today. Had I but known I would have made these changes hours ago. But alas we must slog through the process in person.""

They all seemed to match my jovial demeanor, but the first officer asked, ""Who's Suite Guy?""

I feigned shock and gave him a brief rundown of my previous interaction with the man on the phone. The first officer was quick to throw the captain under the bus, at which point I said, ""so you're Suite Guy! It's a pleasure to finally make your acquaintance in person. I wanted to make sure you didn't feel like you were getting screwed. Although I'm concerned because from my experience happiness is a feeling that comes from the inside, so I'm not sure this larger room will give you the key.""

Suite guy seems a little taken off balance from being called out, so he nervously says, ""Well I'll feel pretty happy in a suite.""

""Perhaps we can start from the outside and work our way in,"" I said as I handed out keys.  ""In any event have a wonderful stay, and please let us know if you need anything else.""

As they were walking away I smiled, pointed at him and yelled, ""Suite Guy!"" As if I was cheering for a basket ball player. 

I hope I made my point. What do you think?",50,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF5AAD60>
114,Update to That Didn't Go As Expected,"So yesterday I posted a transcript of the messages in the work group chat before/after I sent my message quitting. The response was very underwhelming, and a lot of people (including me) seemed bummed that I pretty much got no response to the message I sent. But! I decided to check the FDM's Facebook today because she's had a history of talking crap about people on there. And boy did I find something funny. The following is a transcript of two of her posts from Friday (the day I quit) and yesterday. Hopefully the people that were bummed about the lack of response get at least a little laugh out of this (I know I did).

This is her post from Friday (edited for grammar and spelling because she seriously can't spell):

""Careful what you wish for story... I'm usually at work by 5:30am. I think I've got a pretty good connection with the staff on the gaming floor. I take notice with each one of them on a personal level. I do my best to ""see"" them. Maintenance, security, ES, surveillance, they're all people to me...they just wear different uniforms. \*shrugging emoji\* I said the other day ""I miss 2nd shift...I feel like I never see them anymore"".

Well, I'll be working 2nd & 3rd shift at the hotel. So I'll be able to see everyone again. I currently have 3 employees at the hotel.

When you have an ""I don't care attitude"" it not only affects your coworkers, but it affects each and every department down the line.

Thank you to the parents of this generation entering the work force. I am absolutely hopeful. I see so many young kids who are eager to learn, eager to work, and eager to leave their mark on the world.

Job fair is on the 23rd, interviews will be done on the spot. There has been a wage increase...Guest Service Representative 1st & 2nd shift. Hotel Night Audit.""

&#x200B;

And then, she posted a picture yesterday that says ""It's one of those days where even my coffee needs a coffee"", and her comment on it was this:

""Yup...Shoulda just taken bets on how long a certain individual would last working...smh...Someone please tell me how you live off love... \*shrugging emoji\*""

So yeah, she's basically talking crap about me on Facebook because apparently she has nothing better to do. It's actually kind of sad.

115,Something happened that I still can't explain,"Sometime towards the end of 2019, a male guest arrived to a hotel, checked in and paid cash.

He got checked in by a trainee, who forgot to insist on taking his ID number. A name and nationality he claimed on a form were both Irish. Trainee wasn't exactly sure if that was really the case. 

He booked a room for a week and hung an ""do not enter"" sign on a door knob. It stayed so for about 4 days until one morning, when maid found it on the floor in front of the door. Since the sign has ""do not enter"" on one side and ""please, clean my room"" on the other, she didn't know what to do and decided to go in.

She was hit by a strong stench of chemicals. She walked in and noticed a bunch of empty bleach bottles in a corner of a room. There was a trash bag with lots of cut off clothes' tags in them. All the bedding was off of bed. A bucket lay on the floor, filled with bleach. There was a male shirt inside.

Walls were wet, obviously wiped down with bleach, as was every single piece of furniture in the room. One could drown oneself in a puddle of bleach in the bathroom. All the bedding was in a bathtub, soaked in bleach.

We called the police. The guest never returned. All the data he gave us was false.

There were a few drops of blood found on his bleach - soaked shirt.


I always found this event inexplicable. At the time it occurred, we (the employees) were half-joking, half-expecting to hear about some body found in the neighbourhood. It never happened, so I kind of forgot about it until a few days ago, when I saw a Netflix documentary about a Jane Doe found dead in a hotel room, who checked in in a similar manner and also had her tags cut off. Afterwards, I found out about several other similar cases.

116,I'd Die If They Wouldn't Reanimate Me & Put Me Back To Work (An Angry Rant),"So, as I've said before on here, we are short staffed. We are still down 1 part-time Night Audit, and maybe someone else to cover random shifts to maybe make my life easier. 

This hasn't stopped anyone's (except mine!) vacation from being approved. And we don't have enough people to fill all the slots so I'm doing 9 to 12 hours shifts, because I'm salary and nobody is allowed to get overtime, per our management company.

That's right, I requested (in December) for vacation this coming week because my husband is a teacher and it's Spring Break. It got denied because another coworker (GM's very obvious favorite) had to move her vacation from January to this week. 

Our full time Night Audit was supposed to be here tonight, but whatdoyouknow, his flight got delayed. This is something he does EVERY SINGLE TIME that he travels out of town. He didn't even call. He had his mom call. This is a 6 day (not including tonight) vacation he requested just a week ago. My GM should know by now that if he says 3 days, make it 4. 

But the Gm's favorite is on vacation. So, I get shafted. I get to do a surprise (but shouldn't be) double (17hrs), and then be back for PM shift at 3pm! 

It took 3 full hours for my GM to text me back. Her response was ""OMG! That's awful. I'm in (city 10hr drive from us) and my return flight isn't until Monday. I'll try and get someone to cover for you tomorrow, but you might have to come in for a few hours."" 

Why the hell am I still in this industry? I love it but I really hate the bullshit I'm dealing with. Getting anyone to cover a shift for me is an act of God. People don't say anything about appointments until the day before and they either want to come in late, or want me to come in early. I can't get 2 consecutive days off to save my life. If I get a day off, I'm constantly called and texted. People act like they don't know the basics and I'm left constantly fixing things. My GM says ""If you train them right, then you'll have so much less stress."" I have gone over everything countless times and ways, but they're still not getting it. I made a 3 inch binder full of cheat sheets and how to do different things, and I still get called and told ""that's not in the binder"" even if it is. My schedule is literally all over the place. The ridiculousness of my shifts is affecting my health. 

I'm very much still deciding if I want to take the cash drawer into my Gm's office, and drop my keys on her desk, lock her door and leave without telling anyone. I'm already applying for other AGM/GSM jobs in my area. At this point, I'll take a paycut just so I can get a job where I don't want to kill myself or someone else.",40,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF5AAE80>

118,But My Kid is Graduating,"So I work at the front desk and reservations at a small luxery hotel in a major city and college town with multiple major colleges including an ivy league.

Lady calls to set up 2 reservations for a 2 night stay, fri and sat, for her kid's graduation 2 months away and she wants it cheap. So the problems with that if you want a room here on college graduation weekend on one of our busiest weekends of the year.

To get the best deal your need to book up to 2 years in advance.
To get your preferred room type with a moderate price you need to book 1 year in advance.
To get a room in general 8 months.
To avoid a 3 night minimum 6 months
To get any room at all with a 3 night minimum within 5 months you better be ready to accept any price we give you.

I tell her we are booked full for sat and sun night then she starts arguing, bargaining and throwing a pity parade on how she needs to see her kid graduate. The bargaining really dumbfounded me because she tried to suggest that if she books the 3 night minimum as thurs and fri would we have open rooms for sat while asking for a discount because the average rate was atleast $935 per night for the cheapest room. As if I was going to go ""oh that changes everything let me cancel these other reservations to make space for you and cut the rates in half.""

In the end it was getting busy as afternoon check-in was starting and a line was forming. I told her I will collect her contact info and place it on the endless void that is our waitlist just incase a room opens up just to shut her up. I made sure to be extra careful, and a little petty, that on the waitlist comfirmation email that it said that it was just a place on the waitlist and that it was not a reservation just incase she tried to pull something in 2 months.",62,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF5AAF40>
119,It's A Shame,"I've actually been very fortunate and happy that I've experienced a lot of awesome and understanding super-shiny members at work in recent times. Even when things were definitely not ideal for them, they treated me with understanding and with knowledge of my limitations. It's being so long since I had a super-shiny live up to the negative stereotype that it actually caught me off guard yesterday.  

When I arrived for my Friday night NA shift(11pm-7am), my night manager(Tom) told me to be aware of a certain arrival still in the system. Tom explained that a man named ""George"" called around 8pm and was trying to find accommodations for his 18 y/o daughter who was currently traveling. The check-in age requirement for my hotel is 23 y/o. George was wondering if we would make an exception. My GM(Susie) has made exceptions for similar cases in the past, but it's very, very rare. She would usually require a more expensive security hold/deposit. 

Tom, who likely worked with Susie on past situations, agreed to make an exception as long as George agreed to a $300 security hold instead of the usual $200. After that phone call, Tom ended up talking to Susie and she said ""no"".....a very firm no at that. She thought we were too much in the busy season to allow it. Tom called George 4-5 times right after that, but George didn't pick up the phone. Tom left a voicemail explaining the situation and suggested that George called a certain new hotel that did accept a 18 y/o to check-in. 

Tom soon left after I clocked in. The first hour of my shift was pretty busy and I hoped I wouldn't have to deal with the situation with George on top of everything else going on. However, I received a call from George regarding the voicemails that were left to him. Let me tell you this.......his temper tantrum was quite ridiculous and lengthy. I watched guests slowly form a line in the lobby on the cameras in the back office as George went off about his ""super shiny"" status over and over again. 

He made claims that if he made a reservation, as a super shiny, he was guaranteed a room. Well, that's not actually a real perk in our brand. Even if it were, it would not have been ""guaranteed"" when the official policy is to be 23 years old to check in. He demanded that I make him a reservation at another hotel. Yeaaaaaa, no.......we don't do that for very obvious reasons. He tried to find any manager under the sky to call him asap, but he seemed to have a hard time to grasp that this wasn't an emergency. He also didn't seem to understand for a while that even if a manager were available to call him, nobody would go against the GM(Susie). 

After some time of going back and forth....and my patience wearing thin, partly for the people waiting in the lobby, I was not hesitant to drop the politeness when he made the situation my fault. 

George: ""It's your fault that I'm in this situation. "" 

Me: ""I didn't put you in any kind of situation. I just got here"" 

If he said ""It's the hotel's fault"" or ""It's Brand's fault"" .....I would have my held my peace. However, after dealing with the guy for so long I reached my limit. 

He eventually hung up.  This is not an uncommon situation in hospitality. However, what bothered me enough to post all of this is that if he had talked to Tom months, weeks, or even days ago and the problem just arose at the last second I would understand his plight. 

But DUDE.....my guy.....throwing such a temper tantrum when it was only a few hours or so since you tried to set something up with Tom is absurd. You knew that your daughter was traveling. IF you planned to pay for her traveling expenses then why in the world did you wait until she was already on the road and at the ""last second""? The hotel is not completely without fault, but it was trying it's best to bend our policy at the last second to make up your lack of planning.

120,Tales from the Bellman: The First Entitled Guest,"Continuing some classic stories from my years as a bellman, I want to brush on the first time I ever gave the confused dog head turn to a guest.

The property where I worked had a hotel and villas, various private homes and condos, and a lot of ocean view rooms (East Coast hotel, some of you might know it). About a month into this job, it’s a quiet day. My valet buddy and I are out on the front curb, enjoying this beautiful day, gorgeous weather, and lovely temperature.

A Mercedes wagon pulls onto the drive, and valet bud opens the door appropriately. The guest is a woman, maybe early 30’s, who is about four months pregnant. She has two car seats in the back, so this would be kid #3 by best estimate. She thanks us, leaves the keys, says she’s just going to the front desk for a minute.

After a couple, I get radioed to head to one of the villa units where a guest will meet me for assistance. My assumption is that I’m loading or unloading a vehicle, which in the end did turn out to be true. I grab the golf cart, head over, and not thirty seconds after am met by preggo lady with the Mercedes, who is now FUMING.

We walk up to this 3/2 ocean view unit, and the entire time she’s just muttering “I can’t believe I was set up in this” and just sounding more angry, so I’m assuming someone trashed the place or housekeeping didn’t clean it, just preparing for the worst.

We get to the door, and it opens…to a very beautiful unit that is exceptionally clean, just with a couple suitcases and a grocery bag on the kitchen counter.

Naturally, I’m curious, so I ask what’s going on. 

“Are you kidding me? You don’t see it? There is TILE FLOORING in this unit! This is fucking ridiculous! What if one of my kids slips, falls, and busts their head open???”

Cue the Scooby-Doo confused face.

I didn’t say a word. She barked orders for a moment to take her luggage down to her car, said she was going to our competitor down the road, and that she had cancelled her reservation with us.

After I got everything in the car, I did get an apology and an “I’m not mad at you” talk, which was appreciated. She still tipped me ($3, which for what she had brought up was equivalent to the amount of help I gave her) and then went on her tile-free trip down the road, onto grandeur pastures…probably because pastures don’t have tile.",28,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF5AC040>
121,That Didn't Go As Expected,"So this is for all the people that were waiting on me to post about quitting in my work group chat...Well, from the title, you can guess that the result wasn't that great. But, I said I would post it so I will. With that being said, I'm also gonna post the messages from Wednesday (when I pulled the NCNS) because I directly referred to some of it in my final message.

In this, Me - me of course; FDM - Front Desk Manager; M - Manager; FDA1 - Day shift Front Desk Attendant; FDA2 - Swing shift Front Desk Attendant; NA - Other Night Auditor (who doesn't message at all but gets mentioned).

Wednesday @ 4:01pm (half an hour after I was supposed to be at work)

FDA1: I can't stay today I'm leaving

FDM: What the heck! OP is a no call no show!!

FDM: I can be back in an hour...smfh

FDM: I called security and told them the hotel is unattended AGAIN and I won't be there for 45 - an hour

M: Sorry just woke up from a after chemo nap

M: I am by no means better than anyone else. But come on guys. I have stage 4 cancer throughout my body. I go to chemo once a week that takes everything out of me and I manage to still work 40 hours in 4 days. The 3 days after chemo I have extreme diarrhea and sick to my stomach all day every day and I still come to work. Sorry not sorry for writing this.

FDM: I've tried to be accommodating to everyone's personal lives. But I'm not getting help with any of this scheduling stuff. NA is the one who's reliable. You other 3 need to find a babysitter, stop pretending you have covid and figure out your sickness. I have never known that hotel to be unattended during business hours.

M: Oh GM is going to love this. Maybe he will fire me this week for not having control over the staff.

FDA1: I don't have a babysitter or babysitters. Let alone know anyone here where I reside to help me that is why I have to rely on this daycare that was in the waiting list for while I struggled to pay for this other daycare which I couldn't afford.

FDM: I said what I said... \*shrugging emoji\*

FDA1: Same here

FDM: You've been here for over a year, you've had plenty of time to find another outlet. No other job will be as accommodating as we've been. I'm done with the excuses.

FDA1: Yeah and it took so long to get the childcare I do have set up

FDA1: I wish I did have other babysitters or whoever to watch my kid all the time I'm already looked bad upon for being a bad mother for neglecting my kids so I don't have excuses for my childcare situation

FDA2: Noted. I think the team needs to pull together and do what is needed to be covered, no matter what. If you need to change my hours then so be it, willing to do what is needed to keep coverage at the desk.

FDM: Thank you FDA2, I appreciate it. There are definitely going to be changes...Pretty soon he's gonna want to open 24 hrs. And he will pull from another department so the hotel will be staffed.

FDA2: You're welcome.

&#x200B;

Friday @ 2:10pm (50 minutes before I start my new job)

Me: If you guys haven't figured it out by now, I quit. I'm tired of being treated like crap and being unappreciated. I wasn't faking being sick, I've actually been sick for the past 3 weeks but kept coming to work anyways because I didn't want to inconvenience anyone. I called in because NA was scheduled the same shift as me, and I figured there would be coverage. And then my schedule ends up getting changed in the middle of the week to make me work on my scheduled day off just because I called in? You act like no one is ever allowed to be sick, but shit happens. I tried my best to help you out, but when I'm constantly being nitpicked over stupid shit or getting my head ripped off for asking a simple question, I'm done. Good luck with getting people to actually transfer from different departments to cover the desk, because half of them would probably rather quit than transfer departments.         P.S. Your staff aren't something you should ""have control"" over. They're not animals. If you guys treat them decently, they won't up and quit randomly when they've finally had enough. \*shrugging emoji\*

&#x200B;

The only response I got? Was the FDM laugh reacting to it, and then the manager deleted me from the group and they all deleted me off Facebook. I'm actually kinda bummed no one responded to it. But I feel a lot better now that I got all that off my chest. Also, I kinda edited all this for grammar, spelling, etc because most of them can't spell to save their lives.",30,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF5AC0A0>

123,Housekeeper steals guests stuffed travelling Companion and gives it to her child,"So this happened at a property I worked at a couple of years ago. For a little background we're in a city with tons of business travelers who are in for a day or a week if they're training. We also had a few housekeepers with very sticky fingers. It wasn't a secret.

So on this Monday afternoon I had a guest check-in who was in town for management training and would be with us for 2 weeks. The next day she came down and asked if anyone had found a little stuffed elephant in her room when they serviced it. I told her housekeeping was all gone for the day and it may have just gotten bundled with the bedding and I'll check in the laundry room. Nope. So I told her I'd leave a note for our head housekeeper and get to her in the next afternoon. She thanked me and said it's ""just a silly stuffed animal I like to have when I travel"" and went off to her room.

Wednesday rolls around and she comes to the front desk asking if it had been found. I informed her it had not and she completely broke down! Turns out this was her 'security blanket' she had since she was a child and she doesn't know what to do. I told her I'd keep looking and do my best. As she walks off my coworker tells me that *the housekeeper who did her room stole the stuffed animal and took it home to her daughter!* I couldn't f\*\*\*ing believe it! I immediately called our head housekeep and told him he needed to get ahold of her and get that animal back in the morning. Needless to say the next day a very grateful guest got her friend back.

I mean who the hell does that?! She knew the guest was in for two weeks so why take it on *day one* if even at all? And she had to take it away from her own child!! People baffle me.

TLDR: Housekeeper steals guest childhood stuffed animal and gives it to her own daughter.",108,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF5AC160>
124,"We're looking for a restaurant, but can we get a side of covid with that?"," Edit: Reposted without name of hotel.

I've been working at my hotel for over 6 years; even all through this pandemic, ""lockdown"" was just a missed boat for me and my coworkers. I've always been on the scientific and safe side of covid, having gotten vaccinated in April 2021 and boosted this past December. We have a plastic partition at the front desk, and while our mask mandate is technically over, most of us still mask up since we see so many people from so many places, without any knowledge of their status.

About 1/3 or so of our guests still mask up as well, and when others ask us if they need one, we tell them it's a personal choice at this point. Now my story takes place in the evening, with an older couple coming down to ask where they should eat dinner.

Me: ""Hi, what can I help you with?""

Wife: ""We were just looking for a really good Thai food restaurant, are there any nearby?""

Me: ""I think so, let me see what I can find.""

While I'm looking on Google-

Husband: ""So when does the mask mandate end for Shmamptons?""

Me: ""Well, we don't have to wear them, but we see so many people, my coworkers and I still do.""

W: ""So it's a personal choice.""

Me: ""Yeah, exactly.""

As I was trying to tell them a couple of options for dinner-

W: ""We're having trouble hearing you, would you mind taking your mask down? As you get older, it gets harder to hear people.""

Funny, they had no trouble hearing me when I checked them in and spoke at a natural volume.

Me: ""I'm boosted, sure, not a problem.""

H: ""Yeah, we've been trying to get covid for the last 2 years, but haven't been able to...""

This is a first for me at the front desk. I WISH I had just told them I don't talk about that topic when I'm working, but I just couldn't hold it in.

Me: ""My best friend and her roommate got it, and it was terrible.""

W: ""Did she have ivermectin to make it go away?""

Another first.

Me: ""...That's not really what that's for but...Let me just finish writing this address down for you.""

I was polite and nice this whole time, no tone of attitude or frustration. I wasn't sure where else this conversation could possibly go, I had to shut it down and get them on their way.

H: ""Yeah, my employees got covid, but I can't seem to get it.""

Me: -straight-faced- ""I wouldn't recommend it. Anyways, here's the restaurant that has the best reviews, I hope you enjoy your dinner!""

They came back about an hour later, and I asked them about the restaurant and told them I'd have to bring my hubby there and try it out. No more mention of covid, just normal customer service conversation. This doesn't happen often here, and my coworker says they were just trying to get a rise out of me, which I can't think of why it sounds like a good idea to see if they can make the front desk girl uncomfortable. I'm going to try my hardest to hit the next anti-vax anti-mask weirdo with ""I'm working, so this is not an appropriate topic of conversation."" If they try to make me uncomfortable, I'll hit 'em back with their turn to be uncomfortable.",73,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF5AC1C0>
125,"""Last Chance"" - Hotel Room Haggling with Cheapskate Chuck","📷[**Long**](https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheFrontDesk/search?q=flair_name%3A%22Long%22&restrict_sr=1)

TL;DR: Increasingly irritating guest tries to wear me down for my last room for $90 less than what it was worth, didn't believe anyone would actually pay full price for a sold-out hotel on a Saturday night.

So this happened one night on my shift at the Shmampton Inn, not a groundbreaking story, but I found it amusing. Also, I'm sorry if it's long, I like to paint a picture.

As most hotels in destination areas (SD in CA for me) during the summer, weekends fill up real fast. This is not news. Plus, with Covid restrictions lifted where I'm at, folks are traveling again to get out of their houses, see family, or just vacation in general. We've also seen our summer rates go somewhat back to normal (we'll get into what the low-low rates last year brought in on another day), which most are willing to pay because they just need a room. I'm sure my fellow FDAs are used to phone calls all through the shift asking for availability, and even a few walk-ins to disappoint in person. Which brings me to the night in question.

When a hotel that's close to selling out can snag a room to hold onto for a couple/few hours, it's a great thing to have in our back pocket. It doesn't always show up, but when it does, it usually goes to a caller or walk-in later on in the evening. But just in case of emergency - if something like the AC goes out, a shower won't work, etc., I have a back up room they can use or move into for the night. It can be a lifesaver. It's also handy if an existing guest wants another room, the caveat being they obviously have to pay for it, at what it costs. What a concept.

So 2 of my guest rooms in house are family or friends, not sure which, but they were hanging out in my lobby for a few hours playing Liar Dice (never played it, sounds like fun!) Not too many main characters in this, just me, a younger girl in her early 20's (YG), and our star, a mid-50's gentleman we'll call Cheapskate Chuck (CC).

So as they started to convene in my lobby, YG asked me if I had any extra rooms available. I truthfully told her I had a cancellation that left me with a spare room I can hold onto for her for a bit, regular rate is at $224 plus tax. She said ok, I'll get back to you. Cool.

They play for a bit, then CC decides to try his hand at my hold. This isn't verbatim, but super close to what I remember.

CC: ""So do you have any extra rooms tonight?""

Me: ""I actually have a king with a sofa bed at $224 plus tax tonight.""

CC: ""Do you have a military discount, or \~is that the best you can do?\~"" \[Don't we all just love that question? For me, it's like nails on a chalkboard.\]

Me: ""Well, I can apply 10% off for that discount, which brings it to $202.60 before tax.""

CC: ""So it really doesn't take off anything, then.""

Me: {blank stare for a sec}

CC: ""What if you gave it to me for $130? Can you do that?""

Now. I don't mind throwing guests a can of coke or a couple water bottles, not at all. Even applying a AAA discount on the room on check in if they booked through us, if they ask. But he had this little smarmy smirk when he offered to pay me almost $100 less than what my rooms are worth right now, like he'd be doing me an actual favor by deigning to take the room off my hands.

Me: ""I don't think we can go that low, just because of the high travel season right now, but let me give my manager a call and at least ask."" And, just as I thought, he says, ummm no, definitely not, but we can match his current rate, which is? $185. Ok, thanks, I'll let him know.

Me: ""So, unfortunately, we can't do the $130, but we can match your current rate on your room, $185.""

This is probably my favorite part, his reasoning.

CC: ""Nah, that's too much. We have a big wedding tomorrow. I mean, they would just be using the room to sleep in, and besides, no one else is coming in tonight, it's late.""

The lion, the witch, and the audacity. Ok. So it's about 9:30 or so, on a Friday in July in SD, CA. I didn't get to tell him I've been fielding calls all day and even turned away a few people looking for a room earlier, because I was just plum out.

Me: ""I'm sorry, but I can't do it for less than the $185. Let me know if you want it.""

He goes back to his table and plays for a few minutes more, but a few times I heard, ""last chance on the $130 room! Nobody else will take it, you're missing out."" I honestly just tuned him out, because he was yelling at me from across the room, and I was annoyed. On a trip to the bathroom right past my desk, another ""last chance on the $130 room.""

At that point, about 10:15, I had been asked by another member of their group for an extra pillow, which I had to venture up to 3rd floor storage to track down. Before I headed up, I pushed back the hold for a few days down the line. As I came down to hand the pillow to the other guy at the same table as CC...

CC: ""So you're not gonna let me take the room for $130?""

Me: ""I just released it back into our regular inventory for tonight, so someone will snag it up.""

As I'm walking away: ""Oh, that's not gonna happen"" in a snotty, ""I-know-better-than-you-who's-worked-here-for-6-years"" tone. And YG, who I liked up until now, chimed in with another chorus of ""yeah, that's not gonna happen.""

I didn't have anything to say to that, luckily they were walking to their rooms by the time I came around to my computer at the desk.

Not 15 minutes later, I got a call from a girl looking for a room, who I had to disappoint because, surprise surprise - somebody booked my last room for $4 less than the standard rate. I wish I could get into the minds of some of my guests, just to see why they think what think, but then....that sounds terrifying and silly at the same time.",30,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF5AC220>

127,Broke my hand fighting a Guest.,"This happened a few years ago. Pretty sure it was around November 2015. 

\*Trigger warning for rape attempt.\*  


I was working night shift at a small hotel. There was a couple staying there, and around 1am she leaves to go who knows where and the guy stays alone in his room. 

Starting there, he doesn't stop giving me issues all night. Neighboring rooms start calling me about him shouting and crying loudly. 

I had a regular staying nearby who worked all night and would come down for smokes often and tell me ""he's at it again"".   


I went to his room a few times and he was incredibly drunk. At one point he just starts crying that his dad was dying and the more compassionate part of me ends up giving him a hug and trying to get him to go to sleep. This didn't really help much as I got a few more complaints throughout the night. In hindsight I probably should have had him kicked out by then. But yeah, there's a lot I didn't do properly in this story. 

&#x200B;

At about 6 am. His partner comes back, and I remember thinking ""Thank goodness, finally things will calm down"". 

About 10-15 minutes later I get a call from my regular ""They're shouting like crazy at each other""

So I go back up to know on their door and tell them they need to calm down. And once I knock she shouts ""HELP HELP!""

Adrenaline kicks in, I open the door, and find her face down on the bed with her pants pulled down and him on top of her in nothing but his underwear.   
She looks back at me and says ""Help, he's trying to rape me!""

So I grab him by the neck and throw him out of the room and close the door behind me. 

I then realize I left my phone at the front desk and the main door to the hotel was locked, so I shout at him to come down to the front desk with me. I rush down and to my surprise he actually starts following about half way there, but then turns back. I didn't care since I just needed to call the cops.   


When I got to the front desk, the phone was ringing like crazy from all the guests trying to contact me. I unlock the front door, and start calling the police. 

As I look through the cameras, I see he's made his way back to the room and is pounding on the door. 

Again, in hindsight I should have just stayed there and waited for the police. But at the time I was concerned for her safety so I rushed back upstairs while getting through. At this point the guy had been nothing but calm with me so I didn't really expect things to get violent. 

I stopped him from banging on the door and tried to get him away from it. I'm already on the phone with the operator when he takes his first swing at me. 

As I mentioned, he's extremely drunk and I've been doing combat sports for a long time. So the punch is very slow and never had a chance of actually hitting me. I did not feel in danger at this point. 

I pushed him away and he fell on his back. Told the operator he had attacked me and she said Police were on the way. 

I didn't really want to try and subdue him on the floor since at the time I didn't have any ground fighting experience and he had a lot of mass on me (this made me to take some BJJ later). Also, the only way I felt it was possible to keep him there and stay safe was to kick him, which I didn't do because I didn't want to hurt him or get in trouble. 

So he stands up and immediately starts swinging at me again. I front kick him onto his back again and keep telling him to stay down. 

He gets up again and comes at me. I can't remember what I did for him to fall this time. But instead of back he fell forwards and managed to grab my tie as he went down and connected a punch to my face with his other hand.   
He then grabbed me around my legs to stay up and this is where I kind of switched into ""\*chuckles\* I'm in danger"" mode.   
I really didn't want to go to the floor with this guy, but I mostly was worried he would try to bite my groin as his face was very close to all my most sensitive areas.   
So then I dropped the phone which up until then I was narrating everything that was happening to the operator. I start backing up to get a wall behind me so I wouldn't fall onto my back and after I do I start elbowing the living crap out of his head.   
He drops so is now only holding on to my lower legs. 

Since I can't reach with my elbow I start hammer fisting the back of his neck. And I don't know if it's because I wasn't scared of his face next to my groin anymore or what, but my rationale kicked in and I was thinking ""Shit, that's a bad spot, I could hurt his spine"" and started punching his head. I managed to free my legs and make some distance. 

He got up and was coming at me again when the police showed up and tackled him to the ground and took him into custody. 

When my colleague arrived at 7 and I started writing my report I noticed the pain on my left hand. So I decided to go to the doctor, and yep. My fist had a small fracture from when I was stupidly punching the back of his head. 

&#x200B;

A few days later I was called into the Manager's office to discuss the incident. I was told the police got back to him about finding drugs in his room and also having a warrant for his arrest. The way he said it was ""He was not a good guy"". 

He then told me in the nicest ways possible that I should never do that again as it broke company policy to get involved and that I should always leave those matters to the Police as staff safety was number 1 priority. It was kind of like getting a verbal disciplinary but not quite there something along the lines of ""\*name\* I admire what you did. But you can't put yourself in danger like that. don't ever enter a guest's room. He could have been armed and you could be dead right now""

Which also may have been valuable because a few months later there was another situation where a guest ended up pulling a knife and I was calling the police from downstairs while watching the camera. Had I not had this conversation I may have been dumb enough and tried to be up there solving the issue myself. 

He also asked  some stupid questions about analyzing the situation. 

""But that was his wife telling you she was getting raped? They were together?""

and ""Was he... erect at the time?""

As if I was going to stop and try to look for these signs after a woman clearly just shouted at me that someone was trying to rape her FFS. 

&#x200B;

Anyway. I left the hospitality business in 2016 and wouldn't go back.

129,Keep having issues with housekeeping,This has been an ongoing thing the Shmilton I work at. Rooms aren’t getting properly cleaned or are marked as clean when they are still dirty. Today I’ve had two complaints so far. One room I was told by the housekeeping supervisor it was clean so she marked it as clean but when the guest arrived there were no towels or anything. The second room the room had been marked clean before I had arrived for my shift so I sold it to a guest and when they went in they found the bathroom shower covered in used soap and the sink had hairs in it. This is the same damn room that was marked last time as clean but when the guest arrived in it as well it was absolutely disgusting and looked as if someone had peed on the sheets. I don’t fucking know why this is happening and it’s so frustrating having to deal with the backlash from housekeeping’s mistake. I’ve informed my manager and she told me something will be done about it soon just hold tight but god it’s so damn frustrating. Why can’t they just do their job correctly? Or not mark a room clean when it’s dirty? Our hotel owner is a very understanding person when it comes to things like not being able to get a room clean so why lie and say it’s clean when you can leave it dirty?,17,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF5AC3A0>
130,Is It Just Me or??????,"Does anyone else get excited when broken things at the hotel FINALLY gets fixed once and for all? I got excited yesterday. Its like a weight had been lifted and I can breathe a sigh of relief.  So our guest laundry washing machine (out for 7 months) got fixed. The hole in our ceiling above the breakfast area (been open for an entire year and ants fell on a guest eating his breakfast) FINALLY got fixed. And today, the people who clean our inside heated pool (been fixed and broken several times for three months) FINALLY fixed the broken heater once and for all. It was beginning to drive me crazy. 

I had to come up with different lies and excuses of why this wasn't working or why that wasn't working. The guest were getting irritated and so was I. Many families ONLY booked us just to use our inside pool that's advertised on our website. So, imagine they get here and try to go for a swim only for the water to be icy cold. All the staff knew about these things including the manager who'd play crazy and try to blame us. She'd say in front of the guest ""why didn't you all tell me about this or tell me about that?"" And we'd look at her and then each other. There were so many times we wrote work orders, given her a copy and written it down in our log book. But yet, she claims she didn't know anything. Yeah, Ok. I usually feel bad for lying to the guest especially after seeing the little kids disappointed faces. 

And imagine the guest who are staying with us, such as traveling nurses, for months on end. One guy who owns a business down the street from us has (had) several rooms for two months of different contractors and servicemen staying at our hotel. He's been doing that for years. And this year, he ended his contract with us due to the fact that the washer was out for months. Nor could they use the inside heated pool for several months. 

I'm sorry to see him go because during the height of C0V!D his rooms kept us afloat but I understand. Unfortunately, Things didn't get fixed in time to keep him from leaving. And the ONLY reason why the owners/managers are making sure everything gets fixed is because: YOU GUESSED IT=INSPECTION. At least things are getting done. However, we're still waiting on the people to fix our 2nd dryer in the laundry room. Our laundry person quit over that and I don't blame her. She'd been lied to for about 5 months by the manager. But that's a whole different story for another day. Anyway!!!! I just had to vent my frustrations and now my happiness.

131,Coworker is a creep,"Need some advice for me (f32) and my one coworker (f26).

We have another coworker (m30) who works NA during the week (I do the weekends and evenings during the week). He started a couple months before me and that's when he started getting weird according to fcw (female coworker).

On the nights I work audit he started staying at the hotel (which he had never done before) and bringing me food and booze. He also offered to drive me home or let me crash in his room after my shift. I thought it was weird and never took him up on the offers and would either get my own room or Uber home...

Alright so here's where all the red flags start flying high.

I got to work on Monday and FCW as soon as I walk in the door says ""I need to talk to you about something!!! What's your opinion on MCW?""

Me: he's a little weird but why?
FCW: has he ever been creepy with you?

So at this point I'm like oh fucking great. I'm thinking of all the stories this dude has told me about his past jobs and legal issues and shit... The dots are connecting way to quickly for me to be comfortable.... Anyway. Back to the conversation....

Me: I mean kinda but not too weird. 
FCW: ok cuz on Friday he did something really weird and has been being extra weird ever since.

Basically dude picked up her phone while she was getting towels for a guest (she had Pokemon go open so she really didn't think anything about him looking at it). He ended up in her pictures and saw a spicy picture of her. Now he won't talk to her unless it's over Snapchat.

Now I started digging into the dude a bit and found out he was charged with some sketch shit. And the article about said sketch shit is really bad. Like let's just say he isn't aloud around my child.. Found out he got fired for harassing other female coworkers at his previous jobs. Has had guests complain about him being creepy with them. And actually one of his old coworkers showed up to visit someone, saw him, and left.

 I wanna sit down my manager and tell her all of this stuff just so she can keep an eye on him at least. FCW is struggling with it though. She said she'd be willing to talk to her but she's worried about retaliation from dude or he gets fired for whatever reason and now we're fucked because the three of us and manager are the only staff that can work front desk right now... Now I could care less about retaliation cuz I know our manager would never name drop especially in a situation like this. And I don't think he'd get fired. At least not right away. They would need more of a reason then just word of mouth etc.

So anyway. Advice? Lol

Tldr. Male coworker is a creep and I found out some really bad shit about him all because he started getting creepy with the other female employee",89,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF5AC460>
132,was I in the wrong?,"Room 112 called and started right away demanding I find his heater or he would charge me/the company and other things the guest was going on about. 

I said I'd go down and check if I could fix the issue (lots of the time it's just turning on the heat) turns out it wasn't working. I then mentioned I was gonna go around and look for a space heater, the one that's usually kept at front desk. Ofcourse to my surprise it's hidden somewhere I have no idea about, more context later. 

I go back to tell the guest I unfortunately don't have a solution and we are full for the night. He instantly shot out of bed demanding I do something after telling him the same thing he is yelling for me to fix it and to fight.  I said ""fuck off and go the fuck back to bed"" I'm tired of being harassed for minimum wage as a night auditor.  

After explaining what happened to my manager all he had to say was ""the heaters in the brown shelf behind the desk   why didn't you talk to me before losing your temper"" the brown desk he literally emptied the week before saying it was being thrown out. yea let me just go look in emptied out shelves and call my manager after being threatened to fight over a heater.",34,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF5AC4C0>
133,The Airport Shuttle Karen,"So, since I've last posted here, I've moved to a new city with cheaper rent (yay!) and have my own apartment (yay!) and work at a hotel with fewer sketchy types in a part of town with fewer homeless people than the last hotel I worked in (yay!). So, since toward the beginning of January, I've had a mostly enjoyable ride at a far newer (open since last July) and smaller hotel than my last one. Alas, now I have to set up breakfast and I have to clean a little bit each night, but I'll put up with that, along with the longer commute (hooray audiobooks, boo gas prices and getting gas once a week).

The beginning of tonight was something else. Lately we've been getting sold out a few days a week and the occasional snowstorms haven't been helping. This hotel is near the airport, so we have an airport shuttle. The way it works is guests make reservations, preferably at least 24 hours in advance, though we can be flexible. Still, since sometimes we don't have too much driving, the shuttle driver isn't always there. Our boss is fine with this, especially since the driver's an older gentleman with leg pain.

When I came in tonight, the woman on the shift prior to me was busy, either checking people in or on the phone. She had also been doing some mopping earlier.

It turns out that there was a reason she was constantly one the phone. Enter Karen, an Italian woman who was visiting the US and had an 11:30 shuttle reservation. I started work at 11. It turned out that she had been calling for an early pick up and was seriously mad that my coworker had the gall to put her on hold because she was already checking in a customer.

This happened to me too. My coworker was already on one of the phones and I was in the middle of checking someone in when the phone rang. I answered it, causing myself to end up in Karen's sights.

Me: Thanks for calling Fall Mountain Suites. Would you mind holding for a minute?

Karen: I am waiting in the cold since 45 minutes! No, I do not want to hold! (Grammatical errors intentional on my part)

She started rambling off, complaining about my coworker constantly putting her on hold. Unfortunately, I did have someone to finish checking in and she was already stressing me out, so I put her on hold, much to her dismay. I'll admit, maybe I shouldn't have, but seriously...

I got the one guest checked in and then I got an explanation from my coworker about the lady who had an 11:30 shuttle res and called an hour and a half early. Oh fun, now I was going to have to deal with her. My coworker left for the night.

She showed up a few minutes later, having gotten an Unter, ticked, not just at my coworker, but also at me because I dared put her on hold. She demanded to talk to the manager about my coworker and I. At first, I told her she could talk to him in the morning, but she wasn't going to be there in the morning, since she was going to be leaving using the shuttle at 4 AM (oh, goodie). Then I ""Okay, I'll call him."" Luckily he was on the property (he's a bit of a workaholic).

He showed up and heard from her. She gave him a long diatribe about how stupid we were, called my coworker dumb, probably called me dumb (I was helping a guy at the sundry shop, so I wasn't paying attention), complained that we couldn't do multiple things at the same time (could she?), going on and on about how in America, the customer's always right, how she didn't see anybody there when she came in and sarcastically commenting on the long line. Partway through it, another guest, a heavyset, bearded guy I would assume was a trucker started recording her with his phone. After a certain point, I just went in the back and let my GM deal with her.

Finally she left, though not without getting into an argument with the guy who was recording her tirade. But she came back, angry that her key wasn't working. Again, I let my GM deal with her, making her a new key.

He wasn't mad at me or anything. Besides, I've told him I've had to deal with worse (maybe), such as a lady (non-guest) at my last hotel screaming at me because I dared knock on the bathroom door, interrupting her loud private conversation I could hear from 30 feet away. In fact, he told me I did what I was supposed to, putting her on hold since I was dealing with a guest, who was there first, at least for me.

Oh, the kicker, there's a spot for phone numbers on the reservation log for the shuttle. We didn't have one for her since she was using an Italian phone in the US...

Needless to say, I'm not looking forward to when she shows up again at 4AM.

Slight update: She showed up at just a little before 4am. Thankfully, it was uneventful, she just gave me her keycard and asked if the shuttle was here and I said he was and thanked her for staying with us with as best a smile I could muster and heaved a sigh of relief as she left.",35,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF5AC520>
134,“I want to move rooms.”,"Guests are so ridiculous sometimes as we all know to well.

I had a guest that checked in after 11pm who wanted to move rooms because of a hair in the sink. This dude had an attitude when he came in too all because his two flights got delayed. 

I didn’t have the room type he wanted available because housekeeping was gone and only cleaned enough rooms for checkin. I offered him a downgrade and to comp part of his night guy didn’t want that, stupid shiny members are so pretentious.

A hair isn’t the worst thing just wash it down the sink. Could be worse, could have been blood, piss, or shit.",22,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF5AC580>
135,Update to Yesterday,"So I posted yesterday about the whole thing going on with my work, and mentioned that I had an interview today. I would have posted sooner but we were having a birthday party for me (my birthday is tomorrow but we celebrated tonight because my wife works tomorrow).

Anyways, had my interview today. And it wasn't exactly an interview. Basically they just asked me how many hours a week I can work and when I can start (I said Friday). So I've got a new job. And the management seems really cool, said I could do my homework and everything, they have no problems with it.

Meanwhile, even though some people warned me not to, after finding out that I definitely got the job, and simply because I didn't want them to ruin my good mood, I didn't call in. And shit has already gone downhill. The FD manager has basically started talking shit about me in the group chat (basically taking jabs at me saying y'all need to stop faking having covid or being sick and do your jobs) and taking it out on everyone else. The hotel manager is basically trying to guilt trip everyone saying how she has cancer and still works her ""40 hours every week"" and how ""maybe the GM will fire me this week for not being able to keep control of my staff"". Honestly, I feel a little bad that they're taking it out on the coworkers who are still there, but maybe this will finally be the push everyone needs to get the heck out.

Just thought I'd share with everyone that I'm finally free of the hellhole. I'm hoping this job will be a lot better (and from the vibes I got today, I'm pretty sure it will be).",42,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF5AC5E0>
136,Pet Policy From Hell,"Greetings from Hotel Hell. Now, as the title suggests, I’m going to be talking about the pet policy our ‘wonderful’ property management team put in place. I’ve posted before, but it’s been a while. As a reminder, I work at a Shortyard by Harriott. 

To start, I just want to say I’m not against pets in hotels. When I worked at my last property, I loved seeing the doggos come in with their owners. I even brought in a box of treats to give to my new furry friends, if their human allowed it. When I first started at this property, I was a little sad it wasn’t pet friendly. Now I long for those days.

It began on a quiet Friday night. I wasn’t working, but my lovely coworker was. It wasn’t too busy, this was back at the beginning of January, and she was having a good night. Then the calls started. One, then two, then three, all asking about our pet policy. My coworker told them we weren’t pet friendly. This of course made most of them yell at her (because why be pleasant when you can be horrible) and one of them finally said that we were listed on the website as pet friendly. I get in the next day and it’s the same thing. This continues all throughout the weekend, some people actually showing up with their pets and us turning them away. Finally, Monday arrives and that’s when it really hits the fan.

Our manager comes in and finds out through an email sent in the late evening on Friday, that we are pet friendly. All hotels in our management company’s portfolio are. They give us no policy, no guidance, and again decided to implement this at about 7:00PM on a FRIDAY. Finally he manages to track down the fees we’re supposed to be charging and it’s. Well.

$150 non-refundable deposit, plus $20 a night. Extremely high compared to other pet friendly hotels in the area. 

My AGM put together a pet policy for guests to sign and we’re off to the races. People are pissed, half the front desk staff forgets to ask about pets at check in and if they do, they forget to charge the fees or have them sign the policy. It’s made things miserable. I went from getting yelled at once or twice a week to nearly every day. Then there’s the people who stayed with us because we weren’t pet friendly, who are pissed that we are now. Some highlights include:

-A man who got very offended when I asked what tasks his ‘service’ dog had been trained to perform. He screamed at me that I was violating HIPPA. This is a hotel, not a hospital, and I’m not stupid. The dog only became a service animal after you heard about the fees. 

-A woman who one of the NA’s checked in. He fucked it up so badly that she managed to sneak her dog in and commit fraud against the hotel, but that’s another story.

-A man who was pleasant enough at first. We chatted about Minnesota, he lived not far from where I went to college. When he received the pet policy, that changed. His wife became more of a problem, she accused me of trying to take their money for myself. Then they left their dog in the room, which is not allowed, and she screamed at me that they were going to finish dinner first and their dogs didn’t bark when we got a noise complaint and I had to call her.

-Most recently, a man who started yelling as soon as I mentioned a pet fee. Apparently, he owns the top business in his state and he has to call out bad business when he sees it. Then he called me ‘dry’ in a review. Sorry buddy, when you start yelling you’re getting minimum engagement from me.

It’s just a mess. My managers are frustrated, we’re taking down every complaint- even if it’s just someone calling and getting information, then saying the pet fee is too high. They’re sending everything to corporate to try and get this reversed.",47,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF5AC640>
137,"Mai Tai, Sigh","Perhaps the most amusing part about attending to members is often finding yourself making drinks you never knew existed. 

The adrenaline of finding the easiest recipe on the web in record time, so they don’t get bugged by the duration of the wait - a different kinda thrill. Definitely not one I like, but hey, there are worse thrills out there and I’d take this one over handing someone a screwdriver (tool) instead of a screwdriver (drink) any day. But, the story that’s about to unfold is not one that belongs to me, but rather one I witnessed and truly love. 

It was just another day - nay - it was a busy day. There was a buffet and an event and just you know, the usual chaos all around. 

A bunch of women make their way into the hall they booked and start chatting away, occasionally walking up to the bar and waiting for their drinks - with mai tai being their go to - whilst describing the iconic moments of their time in the last year. There was just chatter and giggles to be heard all ‘round when, exactly at the 1:03pm mark, there was sudden silence amongst the group. 

Why, you ask? A lone gentleman had entered the party. The poor soul was surrounded by laughter within seconds and the realization that he was the only man, from their office to show up to the Christmas party was written clear as day on his face. But nonetheless, he was a good sport, made fun of himself, and indulged in all the conversations around him. 

After a good 20 minutes of making conversation, he excused himself and made his way towards the bar. He was flushed. No joke. Haven’t seen a colour as red since. He made a joke about how the men at his company suck to one of the servers, and the tangerine coloured drink in the coworkers hands looked really good, he could really use a Mai Tai right now. 

Now, said server was the only one available at the time, but she had no idea how a mai tai is made. She asked for help but in the end just had to google it. She apologized to the man, he was good about it. 

She spent a good 5 minutes looking for the perfect and easy to do recipe and another 15 locating all the ingredients - somehow her mai tai was blue instead of it’s usual tangerine colour. She made a joke about making a guy drink, he laughed. She contemplated making it again but, in the end figured to hell with it, it’s probably gotta taste the same as she did follow the recipe - and our ever-so-amused onlooker seemed to agree with that logic. She shook the cocktail in the shaker one last time and went on her merry way to look for the right glass - which was on the other end of the bar. 

In the meanwhile, another one of the servers decided the bar was too messy - and she’s wasn’t wrong, the first server did turn the place upside down looking for ingredients - I guess out of the goodness of her heart and just wanting things clean, the second server started cleaning up the bar,  saw the funny looking liquid in the shaker and threw it in the sink just as you heard a defeated “no” from the other end of the bar. 

Cue, the bellyache laughter that followed from all parties involved, with the first server explaining in a rather exaggerated manner the hell she went through trying to make a mai tai, and the gentleman just laughing and telling her, he’s happy to wait out here as long as it takes, he’s most definitely in no hurry.

The second server apologized while still laughing and offers to teach her how to make a proper mai tai, and roasting her for the blue coloured mai tai. 

The whole ordeal probably took 20 minutes but it’s definitely one of my favourite stories to tell newcomers when they join work - as a cautionary tale, of course.",16,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF5AC6A0>
138,If you try to come back here...,"TL;DR—I  had to physically threaten a guest

As far as the name of the hotel is concerned I'll just throw that my hotel is ""super"".

A group of 5 people showed up to check into the 3 rooms they had already reserved and paid for. Four guys and one girl. One of the guys looked particularly feral. Intense stare and all. 

I gave them their 3 rooms and went to do one of my rounds of spraying the hotel to cover up the smell of smoke on the third floor where our smoking rooms are.

When I returned they were all back at the front desk saying they wanted a refund because they saw roaches in one of the rooms. They didn't so much as ""ask"" as much as all of them saying they'll be needing their refund now or that they would just rather take the refund.

I don't believe for a second that there were roaches as our fumigator had just come, but that is besides the point. I don't give refunds on the spot. I always shrug that decision off to my manager and that's the way my manager likes it. As far as I'm concerned I *can't* give refunds, but I can cancel reservations that aren't 3rd party.

I proceeded to walk between them and tell them that they would have to talk to the manager the following day when he is awake and proceeded to put a business card on the desk that had his information on it. Walking between these people gave me the oddest sense of anxiety.

I then opened the door to the office next to the front desk and closed it behind me. Ive never had a problem telling people that I can't immediately give them back their refund, but my instincts were like a tiny alarm going off in my head so this time before I went behind the front desk I opened up a drawer in the office and took out a kitchen knife which I shoved in my pocket.

I reappeared and the largest one started saying things like ""but I *WONT* be paying"" to which I replied ""I'm afraid you'll have to wait to talk to the manager to see whether that's necessary or not"".

Apparently this caused the feral looking guy to lose his shit because he proclaimed ""fuck this"" and then ran full speed at the office door before throwing his shoulder into it in an effort to break it open.

I heard the wood of the doorframe crack and I became dumbfounded. After he backed up to take a second charge I took the knife out of my pocket, touched the tip of the very long blade to the counter so that he could see it's length, and proceed to tell him ""I have a knife and if you try to come back here I'm going to stab you.""

Watching this guy was like watching animal planet. When I told him he was at risk of getting stabbed he had been about to charge the door again but he stopped in his tracks. He sputtered off something like ""that's how it is?"" but I was more focused on the way he was walking. He was prowling and his eyes looked like the eyes of animal who was aggressive but also afraid of getting hurt.

I then immediately picked up the phone and told them I was calling the police. They filed out of the lobby and I actually hadn't called the police because I forgot I had to dial 9 before dialing to an outside number.

As far as I was concerned defending myself and preventing him from entering took priority over calling the police. Probly would have only just gotten them on the phone by the time he broke into the office if I'd gone straight for the phone.

Does stuff like this also happen at your guys hotels?

Edit/ Wow glad you guys enjoyed the story!

I also forgot to mention my manager showed me the video the next day and I hadn't been able to see it before but the person who tried to break into the office aggressively reached into their pocket before deciding to leave.

Was probly thinking of shooting me or engaging in a knife fight? Dayum",82,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF5AC700>
139,I am definitely not liked...,"   I came into the Hotel business about a year ago.  I have a background in healthcare and experience with supervisory and managerial roles.  Well my hotel decided to promote from within for a sales position I was told was not being replaced.  They promote a child who immediately begins to tell guests she is my boss. (Not so much, the position is part time).  
Then my GM told me he was going to have me work with his BFF whom was hired as the AGM to train to become a FDS.  I got told tonight that a NA clerk is coming to Days and is being given the position.  I have been told numerous times I could leave evenings and come to days only to be replaced by above coworker with less time than me.  Now it's being mentioned me going to NA which I have said no.  
This GM has called me at home and screamed at me for things that a previous AGM did under my screen and I get told not to do things that others do. (I am also more tech savvy than my coworkers).

I am at my wits end here.  Our scores have dropped 50+points in the time I have been here.  And I am either scheduled 6 days a week or 3 days a week.  It's not consistent. I wanted to make this a career but honestly feel like since I am one of the only non gay people at this hotel, I get all the abuse. 

My coworker who got a ""promotion"" does not even do half of what is expected.  I feel like I am the only one who does certain things.  I am so stressed.",35,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF5AC760>

The moral of the story, IT people, is if we ask for the code of the day, give us the code of the day.

And, if I may gripe a little, it's so dumb that its not an automated message anymore. Instead, you gotta wait hours and hours for IT to get off their lazy butt and call you back.

“No she’s burnt to a crisp. She got electrocuted & she caught on fire!!!! Are they coming??” 

A minute later…she walks in topless, her whole face is charred black down to her neck with skin bubbling up all over her arms & skin sagging off her hand….. 

The guy gets ice & we’re on the phone with 911 while she prays. 

She said she was fixing her car battery in a parking lot somewhere , had a wedding ring on and it sparked. Then she was electrocuted so badly that she caught on fire.. so she screamed into the parking lot for help & the guy picked her up and brought her here because they didn’t have cell phones.
Also know that it’s 2 AM & raining outside

The ambulance came & she left off.

142,Front Desk = Amateur Detectives,"Before I begin, let me ask a question. If you went to a steakhouse and ordered only the fried cheese stick appetizer, would you have any right to be upset that they didn't give you a 18oz New York Strip with a baked potato and broccoli?

Yet, that is the mentality of a lot of guests. They will book the cheapest room on a TP(third party) and then get upset that it wasn't a ""higher up the ladder"" room. Now, there are a couple TPs that don't list the room type and leave it to the discretion of the hotel, but 99% of TPs will give you a ""menu"" to choose from. The following situation involved a TP that provided her a ""menu"" to choose from. 

On to the story, I was a bit early for my NA shift so I checked out the newest TP reviews. I saw one particular review that stood out. On the review, she listed ""problem with reservation"" in the check-in section. On the room section, she listed a problem with the ""structure"". 

Now, I'm 60% sure that the problem is that she booked a standard non-ocean view room(cheapest) and thought she would get an ocean-view just because we are located on the beach. It would be like thinking you automatically will get a steak, instead of fried cheese sticks, simply because you go to restaurant that specializes in steak. 

I click on her name....and sure enough. It's a standard room. So, now I'm about 85% sure of her motivations of the bad review. 

I decided to look at her comments. She complained that only 1 of 3 of her room keys worked. Well, that's not full proof it's the hotel's fault. I mean, it could be.....but she may have also placed them next to her phone. 

The next complaint was that the luggage carts wouldn't fit in the room. Any FDA/NA/Mgr can appreciate that, even if their hotel does not have these types of carts. 

Then she complained that there was a ""loose screw"" in the a/c unit. This one makes me laugh. Who is inspecting their a/c unit that closely or really cares as long as the a/c is working? Let alone complain about it? This is the biggest red flag. 

She also complained that she had to slam the door to secure it. This is probably a legit comment, but not enough to warrant discounts or upgrades. We are on the beach and get hit by hurricanes. Most of the doors are outside access, and therefore are heavier(partly metal) than a standard wooden door. 

Lastly, she mentioned that there wasn't a trashcan in the bathroom, but that's an easy fix that can get resolved in 2 minutes. Who knows if she even bothered telling the FD....or if it's true in the first place. 




Looking at everything combined, I'm 99% positive that she was upset when she checked in that she got the room type that she booked, and not the one that she desired. Then she started to get  nitpicky and point out ""negative"" things that she normally wouldn't because she didn't get her way. 

Personally, I'm one of the most liberal employees(due to some extra liberty as manager of my shift) to give out complimentary upgrades. Sometimes I do it for no reason at all(not all the time though). If I were the one to check her in and she simply said that she made a mistake or that she didn't have the money for an upgrade but wondered if I could do anything? I would respect that enough to give her that upgrade if we had the vacancy. However, I have almost no tolerance for ""time scammers"" and nitpickers.

Here is my response to her, 

""We are sorry that you are so far not enjoying your stay in the room type that you have reserved. Like many other hotels, the luggage carts are designed not to fit into the rooms to prevent a lack of carts being available for other guests. If you need a trash can for the bathroom, please contact the front desk and they can quickly provide one for you. You are more than welcome to have a room move to another standard room, as there is vacancy for that room type.""",23,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF5AC880>
143,"""Rubber Sheets Part II""","I'm not the creative when it comes to titles lol. There is a part one, which will help give context and humor to the part two. Here's the link to part one, although I suppose you dont have to read it: https://redd.it/t8iw5t

So, it's about a week or two later, and another normal day. I come in and clock in and check the arrivals. I see a name that looks familiar; drunk guy. The one who was pissed over the damn plastic mattress cover. I was curious to see if he even remembered that night at all lol.

The day goes on, and then later in the evening, they come to check in. And it's the same exact group of guys. With drunk guy leading the pack.

Drunk guy comes up to the desk, without even looking me in the eye, and says he's checking in. Oh man, he definitely remembers. He clearly is embarrassed by it, and in a way I kind of felt bad for him. But I also found it kind of funny.

I just went about checking them in and was all friendly smiles, doing my normal routine. The guys behind him weren't laughing but they definitely looked like they wanted to. But they were quiet. You could've heard a pin drop.

I hand over the keys, and drunk guy takes them from me with a quiet, ""thanks"" and walks away. The group follows him and they all go to get settled in. And knowing what happened last time, I'm a little more prepared for any drunk tomfoolery.

I dont see much of them, until later when one of them comes down and starts striking a conversation with me. As were talking I recognize that he's the guy who was apologizing from last time. He was very nice and polite, but he was a little tipsy himself.

He chats with me, wanders away, comes back, and repeat. Normally that would drive me nuts but it was so dead that night and I didnt have anything to do so I welcomed the entertainment.

He apologizes again for his coworkers behavior, and says I shouldn't have had to deal with all that, even though I was cool about it. I thanked him politely.

During our conversation I find out that the reason he keeps hanging out down here is because he hates his roommate. Guess who is his roommate? Drunk guy, who apparently is also their BOSS.

He goes on and rambles about how his boss is an asshole, and then decides that he's gonna steal his boss' car keys and steal the dude's weed out of his truck. I kind of just laugh and say, ""maybe that's not the best idea."" He insists and says he's gonna share it with me, because he owes me one. Then he reasons that since his boss was an ass to me he's going to steal his weed to give to me to make up for it. I tell him I dont smoke, but he made up his mind. So off he goes to steal his boss's car keys.

I go about my thing and he comes down a while later saying he cant get them, but he's gonna try again. So off he goes, once again, on his little heist.

A bit later he comes through the lobby again, dangling the keys in his hand and comes up to show me. I gently ask him if he still thinks this is a good idea, that he could get into trouble. He just looks at me and says

""I dont care. Fuck him.""

Then out into the parking lot he goes. I shake my head, and although it's pretty hilarious, at the same time I'm afraid this is going to turn into something. I'm thinking like worst case scenario, like having to call the cops on two big buff dudes duking it out in the lobby. But I cant really stop him either.

He comes back in with the weed, dangling it in his hand.

""Now I got to find something to roll it up with,"" he says. ""I'll figure it out. I'll be back.""

He goes away for a while, and he comes back, and he's definitely not just tipsy at this point. But if he wasnt the nicest and most polite drunk I've ever seen. And he's rolled a joint and he asks me if I have a lighter. I say no. I don't. The he asks if the hotel gives out lighter or matches. No, we don't do that here. He shrugs and is like, well I guess I'll have to wait for someone to come through who has one.

He sits down on the couch and after a minute or two he asks me if I'm hungry, that he could order pizza. I say yes, because I ain't turning down free pizza. Then he goes on to say that he's gonna ask them to bring him a lighter. He says he did this one time and promised a huge tip so the delivery guy hauled ass and he got his pizza and his lighter.

So he gets on the phone to order, and a girl must've answered the phone, cause he put on a little sweet talk and kept calling her ""sweetheart"" which definitely rubbed me the wrong way. Apparently they were about to close, but he persuaded them to make his order and get the lighter. He promised to tip them 50 bucks. So they said yes.

So after he gets off the phone he just rambles away to me about his work and where he grew up, basically his whole life story lol. I was getting kind of annoyed by this guy, but I was also bored and had stuff on my mind I didnt really wanna think about, so I entertained him.

He started to get mad after a while because the pizza was taking so long, and he thought they weren't going to come because their building lights were out (you could see it from the lobby). He almost gave up on getting the lighter.

Then, a car pulls up out front and he gets up to see if they have a lighter. So he hauls ass out the door and turns out it's another food delivery person, and they gave him a lighter. Then the actual pizza guy pulls up and gives him the pizza. He tries to give him the lighter, but since he already had one, he told the dude to keep it and still gave him the 50 bucks.

So we got our pizza, he's got his lighter. He goes out in the parking lot to smoke it. My relief arrives not soon after, and she said that she crossed paths with him in the parking lot and that he's annoying af. I nod my head, laugh a little bit and say, ""Well he's yours now.""

I grab my stuff and give her the rundown on what's happened, which besides him, nothing at all. He comes back in as I'm about to leave. I just smile at my cow worker and walk out the door.

And it's weird, because after that I never saw those guys again. They were regulars before too. If anything happened or they weren't allowed to stay anymore it would have been in the notes or the communication log, or someone would've told me about it. I think they just finished the job they were assigned to.

So not as exciting as the last one and no slugfest in the lobby over stolen weed lol. Thankfully!",16,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF5AC8E0>
144,Can I please go one day without dealing with waste?,"I feel like it's a given with the title, but TW for talking about human waste (vomit, urine, and feces)

I know in this industry, you have to deal with a *lot* of human waste messes. Hell, I think this may be my third or fourth post in this sub about it. Even still, that won't stop me from angry crying in the employee bathroom whenever I have to clean up a mess that someone lied about or otherwise tried to conceal, especially when I have one three shifts in a row. 

On Saturday, someone's precious little angel threw up on the floor next to the main gate between the seating area of the pool room and the actual pool area. Either the kid or their parent or someone just threw a pool towel down and didn't tell anyone. A lady who needed towels had to come up and tell us. Thankfully, it was just a small bit and my coworker and I tag-teamed getting everything clean. 

On Sunday, I was cleaning up the pool room, and the bathroom smelled *aggressively* of ammonia. I may have nearly failed pre-calc (who needs to know what vectors are anyways?), but I can put two and two together and usually get four, so I figured someone urinated on the floor and the good part of an hour getting it cleaned up and getting the smell aired out.

I had a bit of solace yesterday, Mondays being one of my days off, and today *was* looking hopeful, even in spite of the drunk guy who fell asleep in our public bathroom and had to be escorted out by the cops but that's a story for a different time. Maybe half an hour ago or so, two guests came up and let me know there was feces on the floor near the pool, and a bit more next to the hot tub. *Lovely.* I wouldn't say I have a weak stomach, but when there's a deliberate pile of human feces on the floor in the 90-something degree pool room? ***FUCK NO***. To make matters worse, there were three guests (mom, daughter, and grandma if I had to guess) in the hot tub as I was cleaning it up. They didn't seem grossed out and were very kind when I apologized to them, though, which was a small plus. 

We're gonna be full up this weekend with a lot of kids on their spring break (we're not a spring break destination per se, but we're a tourist point for some sports fans and within an hour of a main tourist point in our state) so I'm hopeful but not optimistic that this will be the last of it for a while, but we'll see how it goes.",13,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF5AC940>
145,Another third party horror story,"First time poster here, so bear with me.

I've worked in a hotel right smack dab in the middle of the country. We get a lot of conferences, and are sold out almost all of this month. A few days ago, we sold out at about 2:30pm. Well wouldn't you know it, a woman comes in thirty minutes later saying she has a reservation for \*Smith\* and I say ""sure, no problem,"" and look it up. Nothing. So I ask for the first name to see if perhaps the last was spelled wrong, so she gives me that and still nothing. She insists the reservation was made because she has been charged for it, which was a red flag, because although it was a TPI reservation, it was not advance pay, and our hotel chain does not charge until check out.

Time for the big guns. ""Do you happen to have a confirmation number?"" She says yeah, let me go ask my husband, leaves for thirty seconds and comes back saying something about how it's in her email. Sure, no problem, I can wait. I didn't have to wait long, though, because her husband came in ten seconds later and shows me the confirmation email, with an arrival date set for February 27th. 

It was March 5th. 

I said, ""Oh I see the problem, it looks like you actually booked for February 27th, so your reservation went through as a no-show."" This man looked at me like I seriously wronged him.  The following conversation ensued:

""I put in today's date.""

 ""No sir, you did not, because your confirmation email clearly states the check in date being February 27th, and therefore was a no-show.""

""So I don't get my money back?""

""That's how no-shows work.""

\*Man and his wife proceed to storm off and call FedXpedia, who then in turn call us, asking that we confirm that the guests di not show up on February 27th. I confirm and the ASK ME TO REFUND THE GUEST. I said absolutely not, as they have had the confirmation email for over a week and they were entirely at fault. Third party again insists we refund the guests, and I say, ""If you would like to refund them any money you received, feel free, but we will not be refunding them a dime."" Third party rep thanks me and hangs up. I was so exhausted with the interaction I didn't know what they expected me to do lmao like nothing about this was mine, or my hotel's fault??",26,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF5AC9A0>
146,"""You Cancelled My Reservation?!""","Another night, another annoying supershiny.... I try not to overshare here, but this was too good.

I'm on the last leg of my shift, we're sold out, as always, and there's one guest left to check in. So, imagine my surprise when a guest walks in, and he's telling me that he's checking in three rooms.

I look at him with a bit of confusion. ""Um. I don't see your name, Sir, and we're sold out for the evening.""

His initially kind demeanor changes immediately, ""You don't see my rooms?""

""No, sir... I checked, and I don't see them. Unfortunately, as I said, we are booked for the night...""

""So you just cancelled my rooms?!""

I checked the cancellations, and even the no shows, and his name is not showing up, so I reiterate what I've already said multiple times. Things took a turn from there. ""I'm super shiny! So, you better be ready to walk me, and give me 250!"" I genuinely don't know if he meant dollars or points. . . and I don't know where this guy expects me to ""walk"" him.

""Do you have a confirmation, Sir?"" I ask.

He pulls out his phone, scrolling through his email, clearly upset with me for maliciously cancelling his reservation. ""Yeah, the first confirmation is 1234... Wait, [friend's name] did you book this for the 9th?"" and then he looks at me, ""What day is it?""

""Today's the 8th,"" I tell him, as I look, and sure enough this man who was threatening me with a really terrible ordeal suddenly changes back into his previously mild mannered self, asking me to cancel the rooms, and asking whether or not there are any other hotels under our umbrella in town. 

There aren't, but I tell him the next best hotel in town, while his other family member is telling him they should just go next door. I give him the number to his next best option, while he asks me to call next door.

I *know* guys... I don't have to do this, especially not when a guest is rude... but I did. Apparently an old coworker of mine works over there, so we're catching up as he checks the rates. I joked that we could use another FDA here, he tells me we don't pay enough, and I'm like, ""Wow! Just roasting us tonight!"" as the would-be guests look on in confusion until I finally get the military rate.

They did end up going over there, satisfied with my service... It's just hilarious how fast he went from pissed off to puppy dog when he realized that he was the one who fucked up. 

I'll never understand why people don't double check their reservations.",29,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF5ACA00>
147,GM threatened to write me up for calling in sick,"I hate this guy so much. I lied at the end of my last post here when I said he was ""fine"" just on the off chance that he stumbled across it. The insanity of the incidents made me pretty identifiable to anyone who knew me, but it's not an issue any more since he's LEAVING this Friday. The best news I've gotten in months, honestly.

I woke up at 3AM this morning feeling awful. At around 8AM I text my GM saying that I won't be able to come in for night audit tonight. The whole cluster is perpetually in a staff shortage (because it's a shit place to work) and even with the previous two GMs that I actually *liked* I definitely felt pressure to avoid calling off unless absolutely necessary. It's gotten much worse with the current GM as he is horrible at his job and has a huge fucking hang up about talking to people. He will avoid it at all costs. Sends IMs or emails over things that really need to be handled over the phone or in person, or just pushes it off onto someone else/ignores it entirely. I have no idea how he got his job, especially because he doesn't have any other skills to speak of and this is an *enormous* issue.

A fun part of this is that if you want vacation or to call out for any reason, GM will insist that it is ""your responsibility"" to find someone to cover your shift. About a month ago, the roads were frozen over and I physically could not make it to work. I tried to use reason against this utter bullshit then, explaining how as a random employee my ability to contact people about this was extremely limited. He got pissy and demanded that I contact who I could and that ""we'd go from there"". (Un?)Fortunately, one of the two people I did have numbers for was able to cover, and that conflict died there when my friends talked me out of pushing him. I knew it would come up again today, though, and I was not in the mood to deal with it. Here is, more or less word for word, the text exchange we had.

**Me:** *Hey, I'm not going to be able to come in tonight. I'm feeling like hot garbage.*  
**GM:** *You will need to find coverage or come in, there is no one else to cover*

This was sent less than a minute after my text. He had made no effort at all to inquire about others' availability, and I highly doubt that he had even bothered to so much as idly consider who might be free. He also decided to threaten me before I had answered, I assume because I pushed back against this insanity last time.

**GM:** *If you don't find coverage or come in, you will be written up*  
**Me:** *I am calling in sick. I understand that this is inconvenient for you but it is not my responsibility to find coverage, and I will not be coming in when I am not feeling well. Feel free to write me up, but I will be escalating this to corporate HR if you do. It is unethical for you as a manager to try and intimidate me out of calling in sick.*

He ignores most of this, including me straight up calling him out for trying to intimidate me, and just repeats himself.

**GM:** *It is your responsibility to find coverage*

It is well known at our hotel that I do not respond well to attempted bullying or browbeating. If a guest tries, I immediately see red and have absolutely no problem politely telling them to get fucked or threatening to kick them out, if the behavior is extreme enough. GM should have known better than to poke the bitch.

I knew he was full of shit, but I still pull up the employee handbook and read the entire section on attendance and calling out sick before responding.

**Me:** *I have consulted the \[Parent Company\] Employee Handbook, and it states that I ""must notify \[my\] department manager by phone call or text no less than two (2) hours in advance of \[my\] shift...it is the associate's responsibility to receive confirmation that the manager has received the message.""*

*Me: There is no mention anywhere of any further responsibilities on my part. You have been notified, in ample time, and I have received confirmation that you are aware of my notice. Unless you can direct me to an official policy document stating that it is my responsibility to find coverage for my shift, I will be taking no further action. I will let you know as soon as possible if my doctor recommends I take another day off work.*

GM did not respond to this, instead leaving me on read.

I admit that being left in silence did make my anxiety start to act up. I knew that I was 100% in the right, but I was very aware that I had more or less just declared war and quite likely made things a lot more difficult for myself at work. I texted a coworker who has also been subjected to this bullying (he actually threatened to write her up for not coming in when the roads were frozen over, which I feel like may straight up be illegal) and let her know that the GM had threatened to write me up for calling in sick and that I was considering going to HR about it. I asked that she please make note of any unprofessional behavior from him regarding me (he has shit-talked other coworkers to me multiple times, straight up calling them lazy/liars for calling out sick, and I was sure he'd be bitching about me all day to anyone in earshot) but that I also understood if she didn't want to be involved. Coworker then replied with the absolutely BLISSFUL news that the GM's last day is this Friday, and that one of our old GMs was coming back.

I don't know if he quit or is just being transferred, but either way I'm sure it has a lot to do with his terrible management. The hotel has been hemorrhaging money since he took over. A huge group of foreign factory workers has been taking up 70% of our rooms since shortly after he came on-- and they're staying at about a half to a third of our normal rate. We're constantly sold out but only actually making money on a fraction of our rooms because these guys are taking up so many. March is one of our biggest revenue months, between Spring Break and a local event, and we're making less than half of what we did per day in 2019. They're here until *September*. GM was clearly very proud of himself for this and hyping them up as ""VIPs"" when they first checked in, but now he's posting about how we should not under any circumstances extend their stays and is cutting everyone's hours (not mine, of course) to try and save some money.

Anyway, good riddance Sean. Fuck you.",15,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF5ACA60>

150,My Co-Worker is a Pain,"I have a co-worker who has been stepping on my toes lately when it comes to my department, and I am fuming just contemplating the entire thing. 

Ever since Covid started, we've changed our cleaning procedures not only because we want to be more careful when entering guest rooms, but we are now short staffed on Housekeeping ever since the pandemic started. Less housekeepers to clean= more workload, even if there weren't as many guests starting off Covid as there are now. So we've gone to doing Full Service on the rooms one day every week, and any other day, towels and trash are the only things taken out and replaced. If a guest requests full service earlier or on a specific day for a special reason, they can ask Front Desk and we can then confer with upper management about it. 

BUT the Housekeeping MGR is a *major* pain in the ass when it comes to services her team provides for the guest. Usually they are okay, but it's gotten more and more apparent that if a guest gets on their bad side, or proves to be more than a little difficult or picky, the Hskp Mgr takes it upon themselves to make the guest's stay even more difficult. 

Friday, before my weekend off: I'd gone back and forth with a woman via email who is currently staying here for work. Her company is paying for her to be here for more than a couple of months. She has a small dog, and a cat. The dog, she will usually keep crated, and the cat she keeps loose. Normally, housekeeping will not enter any room with any kind of animal loose in it for various reasons. 1) not all of our housekeepers are comfortable around animals and 2) our housekeepers leave the doors open when they are servicing a guest's room, so if the animal is loose, it could get out and 3) not all animals are friendly. 

The Hskp Mgr had already gone back and forth with this women themselves, letting her know that her room would not be serviced at all because she kept leaving her cat loose. This guest works from early in the morning to late in the evening Monday through Friday so she can't receive it during the weekdays, and she doesn't like keeping her cat in a crate because it's got some kind of ""stress-related sickness"" and can't be crated. The weekends are the only days she is going to be in the rooms to take her cat out, and the Housekeeping Manager has also told her no for the weekends because housekeeping is ""too busy"" on the weekends. 

So, needless to say, this lady is pretty frustrated that she can't even get something as simple as full service done. And I completely understand where she's coming from. So, she emailed me to see what I could do for her. I can only do *my job*, and my job is to make the guest happy in any way I can, within reason. I spoke with the hotel GM myself, and we decided that since she was literally the *only* person in the hotel requesting Sundays as her Full Service day, we would allow her that. If the Hskp Mgr claimed it was too busy, they could just roll a room (not clean it until the next day) which they usually do every Sunday anyways, if they needed to so the workload would be easier on the housekeeper who had to clean this lady's room. I emailed the lady back. 

I left a note in this lady's reservation, changed her Full Service day in the system to Sunday and everything. She was extremely happy, thanked me for helping her out, and I was like cool. Everyone is happy. 

I came in this morning (I'd also had Monday off), to a long, unhappy, nasty email from the lady  about how our hotel was extremely lax when it came to communication because she'd waited all day Sunday after speaking with me Friday, and no one had come to her room. She'd called down to the Front Desk and asked what was up, and was told she wasn't scheduled for full service and that she wouldn't be receiving it on the weekends due to Housekeeping being too busy. She then had asked Front Desk if she could even just get a vacuum then so she could clean the room herself, and she was also told no. Apparently the Hskp Mgr is who spoke to her, claiming to work with ""Guest Services"". The Hskp Mgr also claimed to the GM on Monday that they'd spoken with this lady and she'd been ""happy/content"" with their explanation as to why her room couldn't be serviced. Which was clearly bullshit based on this email I'd received. 

ARE YOU KIDDING ME?? I was livid. I immediately clicked off the email and checked in our system and VOILA, the note I'd left on her reservation was gone. It had been deleted, and her full service day had been changed to Monday. On Monday, on the Housekeepers paper, they wrote down that they could only get her new linen. WELL DUH, because you can't even go into her room on the weekdays! I was pissed off, because in the email, the woman was basically blaming me because I'm the one who told her it would be done, and I work in ""Guest Services"".

I forwarded the email to the GM, and asked her to follow up with me regarding the issue. She pulled the Hskp Mgr into her office once they clocked in and had a talk with her about Housekeeping Cleaning Services and about how, at the end of the day, we are here for the guest. This woman's room will be serviced on the day she needs, because she's got a specific need for it based on her circumstance. 

I cannot stand co-workers who do this kind of thing. We should all be working together so that each department can run more smoothly. The fact that they deleted my note and completely disregarded what we'd decided was best for this person felt like a blatant ""fuck you"". And I'm the one who got the nasty email. I get it, sometimes the customers can be aggravating to deal with, and a little annoying when they get picky, but she just wants her room cleaned.

151,I refuse to believe this many people cannot operate a tv,"I work at a busy 36 room boutique hotel. Our TV set up is the exact same thing you’d find in any modern home for the last 20+ years, a TV and a standard cable box. 

The overwhelming majority of front desk calls for assistance is for the tv. “I can’t get the TV to work” is how it starts, proceeded by my mundane explanation of the same exact tv operation that applies to their own home. Make sure the cable box is on, and in some cases change the hdmi input if the previous guest changed it.

If this was only senior citizens I would have some understanding, but these are middle aged adults. There is absolutely no way these people do not know to check that both the tv and the cable box are on, or how to change the tv input. These are basic functions that any person who has owned a tv has performed THOUSANDS of times in their life. 

I guess I’ll extend the tiniest olive branch and say that the staff checking the rooms should really make sure the tv is always set up when the guest hits the power button, because the people who are successful enough to spend all this money to stay here for some reason suffer an amnesia episode where they have never used a tv before.

152,"""There were 2 call-ins yesterday""","So I posted earlier about the whole situation with my hotel being an absolute nightmare to work at but I finally have an interview tomorrow, and thought I would update y'all on something that just happened.

I called in last night, due to the fact that I haven't been feeling the greatest the past couple of weeks. I figured it would be okay because there was coverage (for some reason they scheduled me and the other NA to work 6p to 230a last night) and I have literally only called in twice since October, both for covid related reasons. 

Well, I just got a message in the work group chat that we have from the FD manager (if you read my other post, you know what a B**** this lady is), saying Manager said there were 2 call ins yesterday. You had yesterday and today off, and she sent me an updated schedule. Where she changed my days off this week from Tuesday Wednesday to Monday Tuesday.

So, since I'm sick and utilized my sick leave for the first time ever, they're going to punish me and try to make me work tomorrow? Looks like I'm going to have to pray I get this job tomorrow because there's no way I'm giving up this interview. So this will end up being a NCNS, and honestly I could care less at this point. It's gonna be a great joy to watch them scramble to cover my shifts when they finally realize I won't be coming in.",57,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF5ACC40>
153,"""I'm not trying to argue but...""","I work at a national big-name corporate chain hotel and this just happened

For reference our security deposit (y'know, the thing that most corporate chain hotels require upon check-in) is $100 (for the stay, not per night). It's been a flat $100 since the start of the pandemic. When we authorize for a stay the authorization will include that $100 + any additional predetermined charges on their bill, like room & tax. (explanation for laymens purposes)

I'm checking in a guest and I provide him the chip reader to insert his method of payment for the authorization, which is one night of room & tax plus our $100 security deposit. 

Guest: ""I'm not trying to argue, but--"" *internal eye roll here* ""Why do you require a security deposit when literally no other \[hotel name\] does?"" 

Me, confused: ""I- uh... I'm sorry but that's simply untrue..."" 

Guest: ""mmm no definitely not. This is absolutely the only \[chain name\] that has a security deposit"" 

He proceeds to repeat that he's not trying to be difficult but is confused, and I tell him, so am I. 

Me: ""I suppose I can't really answer your question then, because the amount may vary but I know for certain most, if not all, other \[chain name\]s require a security deposit for check-in"" 

Guest: ""Well I dunno I guess maybe they did but maybe it just wasn't verbalized"" 

Me: ""Yeah, I apologize if that's been your experience - here we simply have less issues when it's transparently vocalized up front."" (this next part may have been said a little erm, smugly but idc) ""But it IS a standard practice among most corporate hotel chains of similar rank, not just ours.... *like a* ***really*** *standard practice.""*

154,Just Fed Up,"I apologize in advance, because I'm sure this is going to be lengthy, but I'm literally fed up and need to vent to someone.

A bit of background on the casino/hotel first before I start. The casino is owned by a native tribe that owns 5 or 6 others throughout the state, and the hotel I work at is attached to that and considered a department of the casino. The GM of the casino is basically clueless and deadset on running the place into the ground (all the other properties are doing better than ours, not struggling to stay afloat like us). They're also the biggest employer in our little city, so even though someone might quit and say they're not coming back, they usually do eventually.

Anyways, this is my 4th (or 5th?) time coming back to the casino. I started in the hotel department in October even though I had been warned that it's not a good idea. At first, everything was great. Got 2 weeks of training (I'm NA), and while it might not have been enough training, since their procedures absolutely SUCK and aren't descriptive at all, whatever. The FDA that works 3-11 helps me out when I have questions, and I'm generally not even alone because there's another NA that works with me. That's until the FDA decides to get another job and leaves.

Well, now we are down to 5 people in FD altogether. 2 NA, and 3 FDA that kind of just work daytime hours. One ends up having to leave on FML because her mother fell, and she takes care of her (which I understand) and now we're down to 4. So what do they do? They put one FDA on day shift (7a-4p) and she gets to have weekends off, one FDA that works like 9a-5p (although that ends up getting changed so she gets off at 4p as well), me that gets screwed and has to work weird shifts (normally something like 2p-11p or 23p-10p or 3p-12a during the week and then the normal NA schedule of 6p-230a on the weekends (we close at 2, so there's no FD people after then)), and then the other NA who keeps her cushy schedule of 6p-230a Monday-Friday. So guess what? I work by myself on Saturdays and Sundays after 3pm. We are attached to a casino. It gets busy. How does this make sense?

Whatever, I deal with it. We aren't super busy still, since it's winter and we get lots of snowstorms so people don't wanna go out in it. I decide that since we have so much downtime at the desk, that I'm going to register to go back to college, and do my homework while I'm at work. My manager has no problem with it, so everything's cool. Started school in January, everything is fine (even though I'm having my schedule changed like 3 times a month, I just kind of roll with it). But then the GM of the casino starts meddling.

Since they can't get people to apply here (it literally takes 2 months to get into the casino because they like to drag ass), they've decided they're going to dump all that work on the employees that already work here. Yay. So since the cleaning people are short staffed, now the FD people have to sweep and mop the lobby/entrance floor every hour, and spray and sanitize all high touch areas (which I really don't mind doing) on top of everything else. Oh, and did I mention that normally we are by ourselves? I think I did. And then, they decided to say we can't sit down anymore, we have to be standing all the time. What started this? One day, when I was off work, there ended up being a spill on the floor that no one noticed. Except the GM noticed. And do you think he hustled over there and cleaned it up? Hell no. He TOOK A PICTURE and then went upstairs to his office and sent out an email about it to everyone. He's also said that he would have helped clean up spills/snow tracked in if he had had access to the correct materials. He's the GM. He knows where everything is, he just chose to look the other way.

So yeah, now we can't sit down anymore, and then my manager decides to send me an email saying I can't do homework at work anymore because ""no other department gets to do that on the clock, so you can't either"". Then, they decided to block everything on the work computers except for Google.

Oh, and I haven't even mentioned the best part of all of this (notice the sarcasm). Anytime I make a mistake now, the FD manager just HAS to call me out by name in an email or note to my coworkers. And then claims it's because I'm not fully focused on my job because of school. Did she ever think that maybe it's because half of the time it's a Saturday and it's busy and I'm by myself?

Anyways, sorry for the long rant, I'm just fed up with everything right now. I will probably post more later if I have the chance. I've got an interview on Wednesday to hopefully get out of this hellhole.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: Idiot gets a job at a casino hotel after being warned not to. Manager is a bitch, GM of the casino is a moron. They pile tons of extra work on the idiot, and then blame any mistakes on the fact that he's in school full-time as well as working full-time. Idiot finally gets fed up and applies elsewhere.",6,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF5ACD00>
155,"I have to train the new night auditor, and you won't believe why.","Our last part time night auditor quit... guess who's the only other person trained for it?! Yep... me. I primarily work 3-11, or on weekends when 7-3 is off, I'll do mornings. 3-11 is my forte, even though the hours genuinely suck. That said, over my thirteen years, I've done night audit in emergencies. 

Usually, the emergency is that we're a poorly run hellscape, and constantly understaffed... yes, even before the pandemic. I don't generally mind it, I like the leeway you get from working at such a place. That said... You'd think that our normal night auditor would be the one to train our part time night auditor. 

Today though, I was told that it would be my job. And the reason is so stupid. ""You actually get the breakfast made before six, it's not organized, but the food is cooked by 5:30, and [coworker] never has it done on time.""

Night audit was never hard, but we used to do a hell of a lot more. We had to print out every single receipt for check outs, walk the halls, slip them under doors, write down the shiny rooms, distribute the news papers to those guests, make breakfast, and ruin the night audit. Even then, we're generally a quiet hotel, so a majority of the night is honestly spent surfing the net, watching videos, etc. 

It's simple, and over the years it's gotten even more so. We no longer get newspapers, we email receipts, and there just isn't a lot to do. Our night audit takes about 30 minutes to run. All that's left is making breakfast. 

When I do it, I come in, do nothing for four hours, and at 3am, I run the audit. After that, I take a smoke break... and if I'm being really real... I'm not doing this entirely sober. I start our incredibly simple breakfast at 4am, and within an hour and a half it's done before start time. All the while I'm still intermittently watching videos. 

Apparently though... our normal night auditor never has it ready on time. She expects our breakfast lady to pretty much do everything... to the point where she has to come in early to finish it! And the kicker is that when I work 3-11, I don't get to leave until 11:15 at the earliest!! Then when I work 7-3, I'll come in on time at the latest, and she's just now finishing the audit!! She hangs around finishing up until 7:30 at the earliest, and will ask me to help her finish! What the actual fuck!? 

I know half of these tales are from auditors at bigger, crazier properties, and I don't envy y'all at all... but this isn't one of those. There's no excuse! The only bright side is that she does manage to conserve paper, while I just let whatever wants to print out print out. 

I have to train a woman for a shift that I don't even normally work, because the one who does... can't manage to make breakfast on time... a breakfast which is all precooked, and just needs to be heated. 

This place is an absolute shit show. My boss doesn't care, because she's always late, and NA's mom ""always had the same problem with being late."" Bitch, her mom had lupus! That's a real ass excuse, she'd come in, and I'd be surprised that she didn't just pass out immediately. NA's got depression, sure! I have it too! That's a once in a while excuse, not an everyday excuse. 

All that said, I love our NA, but I did need to vent.",30,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF5ACD60>
156,"Oh, the humanity!","I don’t work in this industry, but like most people I stay in hotels. I’m a guest and just witnessed this one.

A Kevin was checking in late (almost 11 PM) and was giving the nice lady at the front desk a hard time. I just wanted my snack craving satisfied and had an arm load of junk from the little shop and was waiting to pay.

He gave her the typical lines on how important of guest he was and how he stayed there *all* the time. Like for a week back in December. He literally said, “I’m the priority here, you need to take care of this immediately.” What was the war crime inflicted upon him? The room she tried to check him into had two queen beds instead of the king bed he wanted. I know what you’re thinking, how did we not all throw down our belongings and start a mass protest right there? The restraint was nearly unbearable.

He was also mad that the flight crews could check in at any time but he had to wait until 3PM. He couldn’t figure out that the airlines rent out entire blocks of rooms year round whether they get used or not and that flight crews don’t only come in after 3PM. (I also later learned this hotel has 24 house keeping to accommodate the airlines).

Tragic, I know. I might need therapy after that one.

157,front Office blues,"My FOM announced a relocation 2 months before.

I get shut down rather quick. They will search for someone with ""manager experience"" and someone who is ""in the city and available"" but they ""like my enthousiasm"".
I leave the meeting dissapointed and unapreciated. I was a perfect candidate, I did many of the tasks for the FOM. I learned a lot from both of my previous managers and I do my work very well.
Fast forward, my college friend got the position. Never in my life I would guess she will be my manager. I respect the situation, it is what it is.

158,"If you don't like how I'm doing my job, you can stay somewhere else.","As a preface, I'm 57 years old and have been in the hospitality industry for almost 25 years. I can be a grumpy bastard sometimes, especially when guests are being asshats, and I'm at the point where I don't take crap from anybody and I will always speak my mind.

&#x200B;

So, due to some health issues, I had been off work for two months and am currently only cleared for part time work (three nights a week). Last night was my first night back and being a Sunday night, I was hoping/praying for a quiet night so I could ease back into things. It was uneventful, for the most part, but there is always that one guest.....

&#x200B;

A guy comes in a little after midnight looking for a room. Since it's a slow night, we had plenty available and quote him the rate. He says that's fine, so I ask him for his drivers license/ID and method of payment. He gives me his name and tells me all his info is already in the system. I tell him that that may well be the case, but I still have to have his ID and method of payment. He mumbles something under his breath but hands me both. While I'm working on checking him in, he says that he's never seen me here before and seeing how I'm ""new,"" I need to learn how things work around here. I tell him I'm not new; that I've worked here for over five years but I had been off due to health problems. He mumbles a few more things under his breath so I tell him if he has something to say, say it so I can hear it. He says that I don't know how to do my job and that the ""other guy"" never asks for his ID and debit card (I did see that he had visited our hotel a couple of times over the past month).

&#x200B;

By that point, I'd had enough of him and hand his ID  and debit card back to him and tell him if he doesn't like how I do my job, he can stay somewhere else. He gave a little chuckle and says ""yeah, right."" So I look him dead in the eyes and tell him ""seriously, you can go somewhere else. I'm not going to check you in."" His eyes got big as saucers and he's like ""really? Damn, you an asshole"" and out he went.

162,Renovations have guests riled up.,"So I haven't been on here as much as we haven't had many note worthy things happen around here. Now the last few weeks we have had the renovations reach the first floor. They blocked off the hallways with big visqueen over the entryways. We also have a huge structure with visqueen covering the entire lobby by breakfast. So breakfast is now being served in our meeting room across from the desk. This is important to note with one of my stories for this post. I also wanna note that our bathrooms downstairs are completely out of order and that there is signs stating so on the door. Here we go..

Story 1 - The bathroom vandals. 

I had came into work and did my routine of greeting and checking in guests. After about 30 into my shift my fire panel goes off. The panel tells me where there is a disturbance and usually it's from the construction going on. Well the panel was alerting me to the bathroom area. So after silencing the panel I took my time and walked over to check out the area. I opened the women's bathroom door and there was nothing in there that would set anything off. The whole bathroom is a mess as they pulled out toilets' and sinks. So I knock on the men's room door and hear nothing and as I open it I am hit with a strong cloud of weed smoke. I waited a minute to see what the two guys were going to claim as they were caught both smoking in the bathroom that is also torn up. I let them know they aren't allowed in here and they aren't allowed to smoke in the hotel period. They both were so high that they were incoherent they just walked out the bathroom and started going to the desk. I went the way around the desk and they stood at the desk. 

Guy1: I'd like to speak to a manager. 

Me: I am the manager on duty tonight. 

Guy2: We were using the bathroom and this woman came told us we couldn't use the bathroom. 

So not only did they not notice the signs up they didn't recognize me as the person who JUST told them this. I mean come on. 

Me: I was the one who just spoke to you sir. We have a zero smoking policy in this hotel and- 

Y'all there souls about left their body. A cop walked in right as I was talking and they both just got really quiet. If you have read my other stories you know the cops are pretty chill around here they come to use our bathrooms regularly. To finish off this story the guys left the desk in a hurry and tried to hide out in the meeting room across from my desk. I had let the cop know I might need him tonight as I might have to kick out some smokers who got caught earlier. The cop pointed towards the room and all you could hear after that was them running down the hall. They got charged $250 for the smoking they did in their own room as well. The cop just laughed as they ran. He really didn't care about them he just needed to use the bathroom.  Poor cop didn't get to use our bathroom either. :( 

Story 2 - The vanishing act.

I had checked in a man last Friday who had came in as a walk in. He had asked about the stairs and if he could use them. I had let him know our hallways down here are blocked off and that we have an elevator. It was a whole interaction of asking me the same questions over and over. So by the time he was out of sight I noticed his credit card was still on the desk. I put it in the drawer and waited to see him walk by to give it to him. Well that never happened and from the house keeping reports he was never in the room as the room was still clean. We tried calling his phone number to let him know and the phones disconnected. We charged the room and everything but we have no idea where he is. He never put his car type down so we don't know if the vehicle for him is still here either. It's like he just vanished. Poof. He's gone. 

Last one - How dare we have policies and rules.

I had someone complain to us (me and my coworker)  stating our manager was super rude. Yelled at her about her complaining and having an attitude. Well I asked around for the story as I was curious as to what had went down. This is the story I got from 4 different sources. 

This woman checked in at 2pm and was in the room until about 10-11 stating the A/C wasn't working, that the pillows were uncomfortable, and she couldn't sleep. She had kids with her and she would just leave and wanted a full refund. Well since she was leaving we could make sure she wasn't charged for the other days but she would be charged for the night as she had been there most of the night. When she was told this she went on and on accusing the desk agent of fraud and that she was going to get her fired. (same old crazy stuff as usual) Well she came back in the morning demanding a refund for the night. The housekeeper was called up and the housekeeper let the lady know there was a huge mess in the bathroom and Food all over the room. Well the lady began to get loud with my GM and the Housekeeper. When my GM let her know ""I'm sorry you couldn't sleep but that's really not my problem. You waited hours before alerting anyone to your A/C issues and you trashed the room in a matter of hours. The A/c was just turned off you just needed to press the power button. I'm sorry we aren't giving you a refund for that night"". The lady started screaming then left. When she made the complaint I asked my coworker if she really just showed up on a separate day to tell me and her the night crew about this. As if I can do anything about it? I don't know she seemed pretty crazy to me. 

I mean I think it's pretty reasonable to deny the refund what do you guys think?",14,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF5AD040>
163,"""Rubber Sheets""","So this ended up being pretty long, so if you can pay attention that long, enjoy.

Back when I used to work in a less populated area, a lot of our business came from our workers. And there was a group of (construction?) guys that I had seen once or twice before in passing, until one day I got to interact with them all directly.

Things went well, I checked them in, everything seemed good. Then, a little while later into the evening, one if them shows up with a flower and sets it down in front of me at the desk.

""Here, this will make the area happier,"" He says, swaying a bit. I smile and thank him as he walks away, and being young and naive as well as being preoccupied with a task on the computer, I didnt really realize that he clearly had a few.

Then, he comes up to me again, later in the night, and says to me, ""There are rubber sheets on the bed.""

I took a moment to process, and being confused I just said, ""I'm sorry?""

Then he goes on a rant about how there are rubber sheets on the bed by the window, that he undid the beds and found it and its not sanitary, that sweat builds up and makes you slide around, and that he pulled his back because of it and that he didnt know why it was only on his bed and that I should make note of it.

By now, I could obviously tell that he was drunk, and I could smell it on him as well.

I began to apologize, and he stopped me and told me, very sternly, that it's not my fault, that I shouldn't be sorry, and that it's the managers fault. I told him that i would make note of it for the manager in the morning and make sure that it was addressed. He seemed happy and satisfied with that so he left.

Then, a while later, he came back AGAIN to complain about these ""rubber sheets"" and this time he was angrier. It was late into the night at this point, and he demanded for me to call my manager. I tried to tell him that they would be here in the morning, that they most likely were sleeping, but he wanted me to call them NOW, because it was IMPORTANT. I didnt even know what he meant by ""rubber sheets"" and I kept trying to get him to explain what he meant but it was all incoherent. I knew he wasn't going to take no for an answer, and being new to the front desk I panicked, so I did what I could think of to do in the moment, because I wasnt calling my manager over this. I called myself, knowing I keep my phone on silent, and when my ""manager didnt answer"" then I told him they were probably asleep, and that I would be able to pass his concerns on to him in the morning. He still wanted to speak to the manager, because, duh, he was drunk and wasn't able to use logic.

And the whole time, I could hear his coworkers snickering down the hallway. Which kind of pissed me off. They thought this was funny? Why not come and get your guy and calm him down? Help me out here?

Then, I asked if he wanted to move rooms. He immediately looked relieved and said, ""Yes. That'd be great."" Which maybe I should've thought to offer that sooner.

So that move took a bit, because he had his coworker with him and they had to get their stuff and everything. And I was waiting for this guy to inspect his new room, because he said he was going to make sure it didnt have rubber sheets too. And I just sat there the whole time hoping to god that whatever these rubber sheets were this new room didnt have them because I didnt know what he was talking about and I wasn't about to go up there with a bunch of drunk guys. (I'm 21f) He walked by later and I asked him how the new room was. And he said it was great, he undid both beds and there were no rubber sheets! So everything was all good. I asked him to bring back the old keys and he said he would.

A while passed and he didn't, and I knew they were all still awake, seeing them come and go so I had to call and remind them. When I did, the dude's coworker/roommate answered the phone. I asked them to bring the old keys back and the dude said he would get them to me. Then he started apologizing for his coworker and thanking me for being so cool about it. Internally I was screaming but on the phone I was just like sure, no problem. The issues resolved and everyone's happy so we're good.

Drunk guy's coworker came down and brought me the old keys and thanked me again. I said it was alright, but he brushed me off and said that drunk guy totally treated me like shit, that he gets mean when he drinks, that he's like this a lot. Kind of vents to me a little bit. And then off he goes, back to his room, while saying something along the lines of ""I owe you one!""

Finally they all stop coming through the lobby and most likely have gone to bed. Right before my shift ends. My relief shows up and I go to check the room. My coworker was afraid they got sick or trashed the room and tried to cover it up with their ""rubber sheets"" excuse. Maybe, but I didnt think so. Because this guy seemed genuinely pissed off about them.

So since they all have gone to bed, and I'm not the sole employee on site anymore, I go up to check the old room. The one with these so called rubber sheets. My coworker comes with me as backup.

We open the door, and everything is fine. Bathroom has been slightly used, and the beds are completely unmade but no bodily fluids.

Then I see what he meant. Apparently this is one of the few (only?) rooms that have plastic mattress covers. Only on the bed towards the window. I had never seen them because I never did housekeeping and the only mattress pads I ever saw in the laundry were padded fabric. I did double duty in the laundry sometimes and never knew we had any plastic ones. So mystery solved.

Before I left I wrote a note for management in the morning, saying that this dude was drunk af and that I had to move him because of the ""rubber sheets.""

This story makes me laugh now but at the time it was pretty stressful because I was so new and still didnt really know what I was doing. Lol.

And there is a part 2 to this story, when they all came back a week or so later. So maybe I'll follow up with that if people want it.

I'm sure you guys are all tired of my updates, but I need a place to be heard, because it's so STUPID!

&#x200B;

Boy-oh-boy, is new management completely incompetent! And the saving grace, the AGM, put in her notice today.

88 due outs. 3 housekeepers. No housekeeping manager. The acting manager (RGM) has also decided that the housekeepers can't stay past 5. Which is fine, until he also decided that all the dirty rooms will be left in the system and he wasn't going to stay and inspect them. So nothing was checked over. I have one room. One. On a Monday night. ""We shouldn't sell them"" he said, not having worked here before and not registering that yeah, we will. We already had most of those sold by arrivals. 

A 'top tier member' decided he was going to switch his digital check in last minute and of course picked a dirty room. And down he came bitching up a storm. He's not being reasonable. He wants the manager now! Now! NOW! At midnight. I'm being screamed at when all that had to be done was those rooms be inspected by the MANAGER considering the AGM helped clean most of the rooms and do laundry, and then the rolled rooms be put out of order. It affects NOTHING. NOT putting them out of order means reservations can and WILL book them. Even if they're dirty in the system. 

It's already falling apart here and the staff hasn't even fully left yet. There was a lot of stock put into this hotel working. This was going to be the towns shining jewel. But now it's going to crumble. Within weeks. . . because of this management. 

In the past 3 months this property has lost: GM, AGM, Breakfast Manger, Breakfast Attendant, Housekeeping Manager, and Inspector. 

The company also lost both of its other properties GMS and one of their AGMS.

so 3 GMs gone in three months? Why isn't that a red flag? It won't be my problem for much longer, I'm only staying to keep my room discount for my upcoming vacation. I already have many applications out in the area, in and out of hotels- because honestly, this last stint has drained me. There has to be a good hotel to work at somewhere right? I'm not looking for easy but, I do expect the hotel to be able to. . . function?

Ursula is gone for the week though, so that's a little bit of relief. We won't have to deal with her until next week. The only problem that came from sales was this weekend when she left oversell on even though all the credit cards had all been authorized for our COMPLETELY SOLD OUT hotel. There was no reason to have it on. Of course I had to walk many people with reservations- to hotels not in the same brand. So, many people were very unhappy at 2 am.",6,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF5AD100>

Welllll we can’t apply it at that restaurant. You used a credit card, they can’t apply room charges over there.

166,Birthday Suit,"At my hotel we have 4 floors, there is stairwell access to a landing above that leads to the roof access. For several months now we have had an unwanted visitor (a local homeless man) that likes to sneak past the front desk and hang out in the landing area. Every time we catch him he bolts down the stairs and out the side door. The police have been out at least a few times a month and are never here in time to criminally trespass him. Tonight I saw him sneak by while I was very busy, so after I checked in a lobby full of guests I grabbed the phone and went to the 4th floor landing. Guys, this dude was totally naked and said ""Awww man!"" once he saw me. I told him he needed to leave, and since he was naked  I left and he snuck out when I went back downstairs to check the lobby to make sure no guests were waiting. Cops show up, found some loose pennies and muddy footprints. I called my manager to let her know and she was half asleep. I wanted to make sure he doesn't come back, for my safety and the guests' safety I chose to walk away but I will be on my guard in case he returns. Any suggestions on what to do are welcome, my manager isn't much help.

Tl;dr Naked man is surprised and disappointed he got caught stripping in a stairwell by a FD agent.",15,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF5AD1C0>
167,I warned you. Not my problem,"I have over two years of crazy hotel stories that I want to share (and will try to limit them), but this just happened and I want to post it, despite it being my second post today on this sub. 

So I work at a roughly 70 room hotel about a mile away from a major Division 1 college and right next to a major multi-state highway, so we get both truckers who need to spend the night and campus-related guests. 

Rewind to two weekends ago, we had over 75% occupancy due to a campus sports game as well as some relatively bad weather/winds. Our location, as well as the couple hotels around us in what I call “Hotel Row” were getting a lot of semi-trucks come from the highway due to the weather looking for walk-in reservations. At this particular time, I already checked in two walk-ins who were truckers. This is like 8 or 9pm when this guy comes in looking for a room and asking where he can park his semi (it was a standard one trailer semi). I told him he is welcome to park it on our lot and take up as many spaces as needed (so long as he doesn’t block any cars or driving area) or he could use our private dead end gravel road behind our hotel that all of “Hotel Row” is allowed to use for trucks (which only had one truck in it. This is important context for later). He said he doesn’t want to park in either because he “cannot back up in his truck” (his exact words) and asks if he can just stay parked in the street where he is (the road isn’t that well used and mostly used if you stay in one of the hotels). I said that he could be ticketed by the town if he stays parked there and I do not recommend it. I even offered to call our neighboring, non-partnered hotel to see if he can park there for one night since their lot has two parking entrances/exits. He refused, but decided to stay here and figure out the parking himself. 

That’s the end of that, right? Nope. 

Fast forward to about an hour ago, he comes in looking pissed. I didn’t recognize him at first and I ask if he needs a room. He slams a parking ticket on the desk and demands that our hotel pays for it. After looking up his reservation and remembering who he is, I tell him that we will not be paying for the parking ticket because there were available options given for parking and we are not responsible since you refused to park in any of them and parked somewhere else (ticket said he parked on the street during bad weather and apparently blocked the only lane heading that direction). He was mad stormed off, leaving his ticket. 

Hopefully he doesn’t need it lol

But seriously, the guy didn’t take my advice about parking and got screwed. It’s not our fault you wouldn’t park in any safe, legal areas.

Edit: I forgot to mention that there was another truck parked on the street as well, which prompted his wanting to stay parked on the street. That other truck still had his engine on and did leave eventually. I think that is why the guy decided to park on the street",27,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF5AD220>
168,Child trafficking at hotel?,"A large group of people recently checked into the well-known national brand hotel in a nice suburb near a big city where I’m staying as a guest. By “large group” I mean, say, 50 people. There is no party or special event happening. Hotel does not host events. About a third are young men, and the rest are much younger females (teens and pre-teens) and tons of really young kids, babies, toddlers, kids maybe 3 or 4 years old. The kids are unsupervised, though I’ve seen the “older” kids carrying the littlest ones around. No adults to be seen except the men meeting all together in the lobby area occasionally. No family groups or parents or adult chaperones. No adult women at all. Wth is happening here?! The group is scattered throughout the hotel with many kids staying in rooms with no adults at all. I spoke to front desk agent about my concerns and she sort of nervously / vaguely said they were staying here on a program to “learn English” ? and that minors under 18 are not supposed to be unaccompanied (which they absolutely are, in many rooms, the whole time we were talking we were watching a group of kids playing outside in the car pull-up area, ages about 4 to 10, no adults anywhere to be seen). I told agent the kids aren’t bothering me, this is not a complaint, I’m just super concerned? Desk agent said she’d talk with manager. This city is extremely immigrant-welcoming, as am I. I have never seen a 4 yr old girl taking hotel elevators by herself, inviting adult strangers to join her, what is happening, who do I call, these little kids are not safe?

169,Black Fog in Hotel Lobby,"Hey everyone!  I actually just stumbled across this reddit when I was searching to see if a post I had made a couple months back in the ""ghoststories"" reddit was showing up in Google searches.

It was about an experience I had as a night auditor at a hotel, and a lot of the stories here resonated with me.  Anyways, I hope it is okay if I repost it here for you guys! So here goes....

I figured I would share this story that happened to me about 15 years ago  while working as a night auditor in a hotel.    Basically I worked from  midnight til about 9 in the morning 5 nights a week for a few years at  this hotel.

I had always heard  stories about it possibly being haunted, but I had never had any  experiences at all for the first few years other than weird noises that  could be attributed to just about anything.  Anyways, at this job, I  would usually sit in the main office and work on my laptop during my  shift while watching the security monitor.

The  office where I sat has a large desk, like a school principal or someone  would have, and the monitors (maybe 15"" computer monitors) are all the  way on the other side of the office facing me about 15-20 feet away.   Anyways, I would normally just work on stuff or surf the internet on my  laptop, and watch the monitors in case any guests would show up in the  lobby to check in / check out, or ask for towels etc..

Keep in mind, during my shift I am the only employee there the whole night.

Anyways,  while most nights were pretty quiet and uneventful, one particular  night I kept feeling uneasy for some reason.  I felt like I was being  watched / something just felt off.   I brushed it off as just being  tired, and just tried to ignore it.

It  has been a while ago now, so I can't remember all of the details  leading up to it, but something very strange and terrifying happened  that night.  At least enough so that I have shared the story with  countless people about over the years since.  Some of you might think  it's no big deal, but you'd have to experience it for yourself to know  what it was like.

Basically, while  already feeling uneasy and sitting at the office desk, I saw a thick  dense black fog literally flying around the lobby on the security  monitor.  (Even as I type this I am getting insane goose bumps).

My  initial thought was ""WTF is that?"" and I got up to take a closer look  on the monitor.  It was still there moving around every corner of the  room.  Keep in mind, I always have watched these monitors for several  hours a night and never seen anything like this.

Now  I was spooked out bad.  The hair on my arms stood up, and i got terror  chills.  I got enough courage to take a peek through the door to see if I  could see it in person (not just on the monitor), but I saw nothing at  all.

I then went back in to look  at the monitor again and it was still there.  that is when I had an  idea.  I was going to screen capture it by pressing the ""Print Screen""  button on the keyboard (Note: each of the 2 monitors was hooked to their  own separate computers)

I kid you  not...  As soon as my hand went for that print screen key, the black  mass flew away as fast as it could towards the bottom left of the  screen.

But, luckily I got at  least a tiny piece of it before it was gone forever.  The even more f'd  up thing is, is that the cameras did record video for 72 hours before  recording over itself, but when I went back to watch the tape, there was  no mass at all.  makes zero sense.

Anyways,  feel free to look at the screen capture I was able to get and if anyone  knows what this is, PLEASE let me know!  This is the first time I have  ever posted this image anywhere on the internet.

170,Why do people try to break hotel rules thinking they can get away with it?,"Just yesterday, I had a local check in who said she would have three kids. No problem as our limit is typically 4 people in a room (5 if very small kids. This is because of fire code that our county does enforce pretty hard). Well, my co-worker heard rumor that she booked the room for a birthday party and for all the kids to use our [rather small] pool. We don’t allow birthday parties at this location due to the fact that every time we had a birthday party it ended in someone calling the cops because of an incident. Well, when I checked her in, she insisted on 3 kids again and I told her twice that the maximum is going to be three kids due to fire code etc. Well, an hour and a half later, she comes down asking for me to unlock our pool (we have to lock it because of regional Covid protocols still) and she had about seven kids with her. I tell her that only three of them can stay because three were registered and the rest have to go (again, due to rules management put in place because of prior incidents). She wanted a refund, but she was here for an hour and a half and used her room enough for us to need to clean it (and the fact she lied to multiple staff members and broke our rules) management would not give a refund. Long story short, she threatened me, refused to leave, and police were called to escort her off our property. This was all caused because she thought she could sneak a whole party into our room. 

It’s just funny at this point because this isn’t the first time something like this happened at my hotel. 


Edit: someone PM’d me asking how my co-worker knew it was a party before I checked her in. I don’t think I clarified, she booked the room at 12:30am that morning, and checked in at 4:30pm. My co-worker was the 7am-3pm and got the info from Night Audit who made the reservation. All I did was check her into the reservation when she came, I never booked it.

Edit2: Yes, it was indeed a party, She had cake and everything. Also, she did admit to the police (who informed me later) that she 100% had intentions of sneaking all the kids in for the party and pool. She didn’t know we lock our pool, and even insisted that only three kids were going to swim when she was questioned about all the kids. If it wasn’t for us locking the pool, she might’ve actually gotten away with it as it was a busy Saturday and I was already swamped with tasks.",59,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF5AD340>
171,Just had a lady call and get upset about the rate being held on her credit card even though I made her reservation a few days prior and she agreed to it,"So I had a guest stay on a point stay at my hotel and she wanted to extend it one more night but didn’t want to wait on the phone for the honours people to extend it. She called me and agreed to pay for a day extra and I made the reservation for her and she knew the rate I was giving to her. Today was the last day for her point stay so I checked her out and then immediately checked her back in with the new reservation with the same room but with her paying for the night this time. She calls me not even ten minutes later pissed off about a “charge” when it wasn’t even a charge and just a hold and said she never agreed to that rate or anything. Like ma’am I was the one who fucking did it don’t try lying to me. I had to put her on hold to get my manager and she was immediately like, “don’t you dare put me on hold!” And then hung up. My manager attempted to call her back but it didn’t go through. She then calls back after my manager left for the day claiming she had been trying to call and no one was helping her. Like ma’am I’ve been here all day and you only called the one time. I told her that my manager was gone and I’ll have to take a message but she demanded she speak with someone since we “can’t get our act together” so I transferred to my gm’s voicemail. I don’t get why these people think they can just lie? Like I am here almost every damn day for swing shifts so I know what happens. Im so done with these people. She seemed nice too but I guess I was wrong.",17,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF5AD3A0>
172,"People, please just tell me what you want!","**Background info**: I work front desk at a hotel that’s connected to a large sports center. Usually there are two separate front desks, but during the ‘Rona, the owner decided that one front desk with one worker drone is more than enough. Everyone who enters the hotel, restaurant or sports center now has to go by me. And since that’s the case, I also get to check everyone’s vaccination certificate. It’s not like we weren’t busy enough before they dumped all that work on us, but that’s a different rant. 

Ever since our hotel reception has doubled up to be “general front desk for everyone”, I get one or two interactions like this per day. G will be guest, ME will be a magical entity. Or maybe it’s just me.

*G: \*Enters the lobby without as much as a greeting and shoves their vaccination card in my face\**

*Me: “Welcome.” \*checks vaccination card\* “Thank you.”*

*G: \*silence\**

Now, if my guest has a membership with our sports center, this is where the conversation is over. Our members only have to show they’re vaccinated and then they can enter and use the sport facilities. That’s why I usually go back to whatever I was doing before they entered at this point. But not this time. 

*G: \*annoyed\* “So, can I pay now?”*

*Me: “I’m sorry, what would you like to pay for?”*

*G: “My reservation of course!”*

*Me: “Of course, what name’s the reservation under”*

*G: \*Gives me their name.\**

Million Dollar question: If someone walks up to a hotels front desk and tells them they have “a reservation”, what would you assume they mean? If you replied “a hotel room, duh!” you’re just as wrong as I was. 

*Me: \*checking my bookings\* “I’m sorry, I don’t see your reservation. How many nights were you staying with us?”*

*G: \*now very annoyed\* “What? No! I’ve reserved court 3 for the next hour. Seriously, do you know how to do your Job? I'm here almost every week!”*

*Me: “I’m sorry, my mistake.” \*closes one program on my computer and opens another\* “What was your name again?”*

*G: “I told you it was court 3! You should see my reservation by now!”*

*Me: “Unfortunately, we have multiple courts 3 in the building. Is it tennis, badminton, squash…”*

*G: \*close to screaming\* “Badminton! Just as it always is! Can I pay now or what?”*

*Me: “Of course, that’ll be 20€”*

*G: \*Now they’re screaming\* “NO IT ISN’T! I’m a MEMBER! I don’t have to pay that much!”*

*Me: “Of course, I’m sorry. Unfortunately, there’s no way for me to tell that you’re a member. Do you have your membership bracelet with you?”*

*G: \*smashes both his bracelet and the 10€ they owe on my counter\* “You know, I’ve been coming here for years but since that dumb virus hit it has become such a hassle, I think I’m gonna cancel my membership.”*

And with that, they take their bracelet and leave me wondering what’s so hard about entering and just saying “Hello, I’ve reserved a badminton court under such and such” in the first place. 

And yes, my colleagues at the other reception would probably have recognized you and known what you’re here for. That’s their job after all. But I have a hotel to handle up here, I can’t just memorize all our sports members and their favorite sports.

Edit: Since I'm not sure I explained this right: this ""Membership"" works like a gym membership. You pay a monthly fee and get to use the facilities as much as you like. It's not like a loyalty / reward program.",16,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF5AD400>
173,Don’t Call the Front Desk When the Fire Alarm Is Going Off,"Hi! First time posting here (I think) but I started working the front desk at a hotel in the middle of nowhere a few months ago and honestly, I thought I saw it all. I thought I was starting to get the hang of this job and could handle (with some degree of certainty) the levels of bullshit that people have to offer. I’ve been physically threatened by guests, had a few tussles with management, and generally had to deal with some of the most entitled people on G-d’s green earth. Surely, I would be ready for anything, right?

Today, I learned I wasn’t when the fire alarm sounded. This wasn’t a drill. I had just finished the night audit process in the computer and was getting ready to run the final reports and send them off to management and accounting to nitpick when it happened. Immediately, I went to grab the emergency procedures binder, the master key, and the fire panel keys, and went to go to the fire panel to figure out what the fresh hell is going on in my hotel. Suddenly, the phone is going off the hook. So many people kept calling in the middle of the fucking fire alarm. I couldn’t solve it in 30 seconds, so I pulled the emergency reports off the clip we have, and started trying to get people out of the hotel and across the street while also dialling 911 and management. 

Then, I noticed a man in my lobby. He was wearing a blue shirt and… that’s it. A blue shirt. He then asked me if the fire alarm was for real.

Needless to say, I was pissed. 

Me: “GET THE FUCK OUT OF THE HOTEL!”

I started doing my best to marshal guests across the street and away from the hotel while I waited for the fire department to go in. I noticed some guests were hovering around the lobby and right outside the hotel and I told them to get across the street because the fire alarm was going off. I called 911. I called management. Eventually, the fire department came, did their thing and turns out that someone pulled the fire alarm.

Eventually, everything cools down. New keys to enter rooms get made, things start to return to the normal, quiet pace of the night shift. I was going to leave the investigating to the management in the morning and write up my report… but someone in the hotel was looking for a friend of theirs and wanted me to check the surveillance cameras. I did so and noticed that Mr. No-Pants was not just letting it all hang out after the alarm had sounded. No, he was airing out his junk in the area around our elevator around the place where the alarm was pulled around the time it went off. He was also the first one to be downstairs.

I’m not cooled down yet. I’m still amped and this happened about six hours ago.

Moral of the story? If you’re at a hotel and the fire alarm is going off, don’t call the front desk. If it’s a 100-room hotel and there’s one person on staff, chances aren’t good that you’re getting through. Hell, if it’s a 30 room hotel and there’s one person on staff, those chances are still slim. We’re busy coordinating the evacuation, calling the fire department, etc.

Instead, get out of the hotel (or at least to the lobby so that you can get out of the hotel). Go to the muster point, follow our directions, and wait for the all clear before going back into the building. Seriously, are there some schools that DON’T do fire drills? Can you even fail a fire drill?",44,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF5AD460>
174,Late check outs,"So you want a late check out, I'd be more than happy to help. What time are you looking to check out? "" Uhhhhhhhhhhh...."" 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️

When requesting a late check out please at least have an idea when you want to check out. If you ask me what time I can give you, I'll give you 30 minutes after the check out time, because it shows me you have no idea how to plan properly. If you have an idea on what time you do and you're polite and super nice, I'll definitely worm with you, and of course depending on your membership. But if you're a jerk and demand a late check out I will charge you for anything and everything.

My main point is have a rough idea when you'd like your late check out to be. If you want to leave around 12 or 1 ask for it, and be polite about it and 98% of the time you'll get it, especially on week days.

(Update: just had a guest demand I give him a Late check out at 3pm, 11am is our check out btw. I told him 1pm is the latest i can do without charging him and he said no 3pm. I looked up his reservation and saw he was an OTA. I was about to challenge him and say sir I noticed your a 3rd party, so I have to charge you for anything after 12pm actually, but he relented for 1pm.

175,hot take: people are allowed to chat at a reasonable volume without having to resort to whispering in the room that they paid for at any given time.,"Night auditor here! One of my biggest pet peeves is petty noise complaints. 

Is your neighbor having a bouncing party or a fight, or do they have a large crowd of people in their room, at 3am? Absolutely they'll be warned of a refundless eviction if they don't shut their asses up like yesterday. 

Does your neighbor have their TV on or are they chatting with 1-2 other people at a very minimal / reasonable volume? I recommend an AIRBNB for your next set of travels. 

Seriously - it's a hotel; you're sharing a thin wall with neighbors of all walks of life.

The most frustrating part of these interactions is, when I inevitably FAIL to praise or even entertain their frantic attempts at brainwashing, the hint is not taken and they keep coming back for more ""conversation.""

As if that wasn't bad enough, I had daily panic attacks regarding the virus for the first few months of 2020 due to my responsibilities to elder family members and my actual (not-so-irrational) fear of killing them.  Since then, with mask mandates coming and going, rules changing and the general ""vibe"" in my particular area (if you catch my drift), getting guests to follow laws/rules has been a nightmare. When I continued wearing my mask for the duration of my shifts even though mandates had been lifted guests would actually ask me why I'm wearing mine, if I'm required to, if I'm vaccinated (which would never fly if the roles were reversed), among other nonsensical things.

Back to right now: This freakin' guy is parading around in front of me with a shirt on that was clearly made in response to the pandemic that reads, **""MY RIGHTS DON'T END WHERE YOUR FEELINGS BEGIN.""**

I just almost deleted this whole post because I know I wrote it out of anger and since I'm still at work, it has taken me probably close to 2 hours to write it. I've cooled down but I'm ready for any blow-back that comes my way because I am so tired of having to keep these things to myself for fear of being pitchforked- which has metaphorically already happened several times by the hands (words) of my own 2 immediate family members.

TL;DR: Some douche paid money for a shirt that outwardly shows his narcissistic nature and pompous attitude. Come at me, Bro-skis.",64,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF5AD580>
177,Left the hospitality industry. My first hotel was the worst though,"I've  recently left the hospitality industry and got to say-- I really don't  miss it. I was FDA and night audit and a few different properties over  the last 5 years but thought I would share the first job I quit.

It  was a smilton property that was initially managed ok. It was on the  older side and in desperate need of a renovation, but it was doing  decent business when I was first hired. The manager that hired me had  started out in housekeeping and worked her way up to AGM of the  property, and with the GM planning to move out of state to be closer to  his family, she seemed most likely to take over as the GM. We were all  happy for her because she took care of every department and was never  afraid to work wherever extra help was needed, including staying with me  overnights when I was starting and my coworker called in sick.

When  the GM officially announced his exit, we were all excited for the  transition of AGM to GM, but as you can imagine by my title, it never  happened. From what I heard, she saw an advertisement for the position  online. When she confronted the hotel management company that owned the  business, they assured her it was just to 'see what was out there' and  that they would get her a contract as soon as possible.

For  some reason- one I never learned the details of, they made an outside  hire. Not only was the manager 'dave' (not his name) completely new to  the company, his background was in banquet and event management, and he  had little to no hotel experience. Our wonderful AGM obviously knew her  worth and immediately got a new position, leaving behind the company she  worked for 10+ years.

Dave wasn't  too bad at first, and he brought in 'ruth' (not her real name) as his  new AGM. At first, Ruth and I got along really well and I liked her a  lot more than Dave since she actually knew what she was talking about  and would answer my emails when something was wrong/ needed to be  addressed.

At the time, I was in  community college while working overnights and had a very long commute  to both places. It was tough but the hotel + the overnight shifts made  enough money that I was sort of getting by without having to pick up a  second job.

Things were going ok,  but as soon as we came out of our peak tourist season my hours were cut  and I went from 5 days to 4. It was a bummer but I figured as long as I  stuck to a budget and focused more time on school, things would get  better with time.

One night, I was  passing the GM's door where a paper was taped to it with every  department's goals going forward. I stopped to read it since it was all  right there, facing the main hallway I had to walk down to get to the  FD. Ruth's was also posted, and one of her goals for sticking to her  budget was to continue cutting night audit hours and not allow any  overtime across all positions. I was honestly hurt to read this, as I  assumed my hours were cut because it was the off season, but to see I  was a budget cut and the first  shift to be reduced as a part of a goal  was a little insulting. I told my coworker about it and she immediately  went to the managers doors to read it as well, and was also hurt by the  language the manager's were using. We'd accepted our hours being cut  because we knew our occupancy was getting lower and lower, but we also  had bills to pay and the cut had been sudden and with no warning, so it  was annoying.

On Christmas, I  agreed to work a day shift as well as a the night before on Christmas  Eve, and would have that 8 hours in between to nap. Like I said, I had a  long commute so I was tempted to stay on the property, but figured I  would just go home instead. Both Dave and Ruth kept thanking me for  covering both shifts since traditionally managers would cover Christmas  day so everybody could be with their families. They also kept bringing  up how good the holiday pay for two shift was going to be and that I was  lucky to have all those hours of holiday pay. It was honestly the only  reason I volunteered for it, but all was good. I came in Christmas Eve  and worked my usual shift, left, and then came back at 3 to cover  Christmas day... only to find out that since I clocked in at 11pm on  Christmas Eve, I was technically working for the 24th and not the 25th.  So that 15 hours of holiday pay I was expecting turned into only 8  hours. It wouldn't have bothered me so much, but both managers had known  this, but had kept saying holiday pay for both shifts. Also night audit  that came in on the 25th and worked through to the morning of the 26th  only got one hour of holiday pay. This was 2017, so I can't remember  exact numbers, but I remember my paycheck was disappointing and I would  have been better off going home to my family.

Things  kept deteriorating. Not just with the FD, but all department. The  breakfast server that had been there nearly 20 years ended up giving her  notice. Housekeepers began to quit daily. There was one guy in hk that  everybody really liked who was written up (no idea why) and rather than  sign the written warning he was given, he just got up and left. Again,  it's been a while but it was either four or five others that left with  him that day.

The one day I needed  off was Thursday, as I didn't have class that day and Wednesday's were  very long for me (class all day + my night shift). It had never been a  problem before, but suddenly I was on the Thursday schedule. I switched  with another night auditor and went about my business thinking it was  just a management oversight. Nope. Came back to a very long note in our  front desk binder (that we were all required to write in and read every  shift) about how I (yes, they named me in the book) had switched shifts  without management's approval and this was against policy. It was over  two pages long and I remember things were underlined.

I  did confront Ruth about this the next time I saw her, but she didn't  really give me an answer about making me work Thursdays. I knew she  wanted me to quit though.

In the  middle of the winter, the heat suddenly kicked out in the lobby. It was  freezing outside (north USA, think -20F some nights). I didn't care if  it was unprofessional, I kept my jacket on all night and at one point  grabbed a blanket from housekeeping. I didn't have gloves but I remember  the mouse got so cold that I had a hard time running the night audit. I  went and sat by the fireplace to warm up before returning to the desk  all night. I did end up getting sick over my weekend, but because I  needed the cash and this was pre-covid, I went to work sick three days  later only to find out the heat still hadn't been fixed. They brought a  tiny space heater to the front desk, but the roof was so high that even  with the thing on full blast it was still too cold to be working without  a jacket or a blanket.

One thing  I'd done for several months at this point was laundry on the slow  nights. I didn't know how to fold sheets and bedding, but myself and my  coworker I was friends with had figured out towels, and we did this in  the back where we could watch the front desk but also kill some time  folding. One night, I couldn't get the dryer to go after I'd thrown some  wet towels. It was the lint trap that needed to be cleared, but I  didn't know how to do this on the large industrial machine, and rather  than break anything I didn't fold anything that night and knew the load  would have to be redone.

That  morning, the head of housekeeping came up and gave me an earful about  not taking wet laundry out like that, as it set her behind. I did feel  bad, but also didn't bother asking how to clean the lint trap. Up to  this point I'd been doing her a favor, and after I apologized about the  wet towels, my friend and I agreed we wouldn't do anymore laundry even  on the slow nights when we were bored. Sure enough, in the front desk  book about a week later there was a new entry about night audit duties,  which now required us to do laundry during downtime. Because  housekeeping was so short staffed, they also asked us to start cleaning  the lobby bathrooms.

Eventually,  myself and the other night auditor that I was friends with started to  look for new jobs. We'd had enough of the place and it was becoming too  much, with 0% chance of us getting paid more for these additional  duties. Our hours were still 4 days a week, and while I could never  prove it, I had my suspicions that our hours were being manipulated in  payroll. My checks did not seem to reflect the hours I was working, and  somebody mentioned in accounting that the company had the right to clock  us out if our shift was over and we were supped to done for the day.  Like I said, high turnover, more than once I had to stay later or come  in earlier to cover the desk, but I didn't see those extra hours  impacting my checks.

My friend  gave notice when she got a job at a nicer hotel in town, and I gave  notice a few days after her when I landed at a much smaller, 2 star  property that I actually really loved (well managed, I had a chair and a  television behind the FD, and was allowed free breakfast every day, +  more money. Would have stayed there for years, but eventually moved for  school).

I later learned the  reason our hours were cut is because the management company was selling  the property, and the main reason Dave was brought in was to make the  place look more profitable.  It worked, and the place was sold to the  new company, but by then it was more or less gutted of people that had  worked there and loved it for years. It still needed renovation, and  from what I've seen in reviews, that never happened. The rooms are  around $400 in the summer, but the beds are old, the carpets are nasty,  and the plumbing was always busting. Overall would not recommend.

The  best part? About a month after 2 of the 3 night audit left, the guy  they hired for the shift also realized how messed up the place was and  quit. Ruth was told she needed to cover overnights, but she had 4 kids  at home and didn't want to work overnights. I heard she quit when they  told her she had to cover overnights. About a month into my new job,  Dave texted me and promised a raise if I came back. I told him thank  you, but that I was very happy at my new hotel (true). He also texted my  friend, but she never responded (she was happy at her new property. We  talked about it when we grabbed breakfast together). Dave ended up  working a lot of overnights. We know this, because he had to call my  friend when he was over sold the following summer to see if she could  take a few walks. I heard he was fired, but I don't know as I've long  since moved.

Hospitality is a  tough industry, and it's worse when properties have terrible management.  Sometimes I miss parts of it, but thinking about it today and writing  this out, I realize how happy I am to be away from smilton.",9,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF5AD5E0>
178,I triggered a hemorrhage of employees from my hotel when I left 2 weeks ago,"I've posted recently about how I was able to step away from the front desk for the first time in almost a decade 2 weeks ago. Since then so many people have walked out that they may need to close for a short time in order to properly restaff. 

In one week a 10 person front desk crew dropped down to 5. (And about to lose another because I have referred her to  the job I am now at) 

They lost 4 out of the 7 housekeepers.

2 out of their 4 chefs.

And half of their maintenance crew. 

The GM is even looking for a transfer to another country.

I'm not sure what the owner is going to do. He is a huge capitalist and really only cares about money. It's an airport hotel with a full kitchen and lounge, and he relies on the front desk to also be servers and bartenders, as well as drive the shuttle and work the desk, and all for a dollar more than minimum wage. I handled a good portion of the work at desk and even in the lounge most nights, so when I left my work got delegated to the remaining team members for no extra compensation. I'm not surprised at all that so many people chose to leave! 

As for me, I'm extremely happy in my new position at my new company and im glad I jumped at this opportunity instead of staying there because I felt bad leaving my team members in a unhappy situation. I needed to do what was best for me at the end of the day and thankfully my team understood, and most of them have left or will be leaving shortly.",83,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF5AD640>

180,Germaphobic or hard to pleased guests?,"Hi everyone, 

Just checked in a couple earlier this evening, I don’t know if I even did the right thing by upgrading their rooms.

They booked a prepaid reservation through ota for 3 nights. When they are checking in we asked them to chip in their cards for security deposit (incidentals). Which I explained that it will be refunded at checkout if they don’t accrued any damages. Its $100 per night so we will authorize for $300. 

The lady looked surprised that I said that, and 
told me that is not what she was informed. Apparently she “talked” to someone that the deposit will only be $75 for the whole stay. Anyways, the gentlemen that was with her took out his card to pay, but the lady was annoyed that the hidden* refundable security “ruined” her vacation. Like Really?

Their room was for a basic queen, but I got them into a better queen room just because I feel like there was a miscommunication on our end. As soon as she got into the room she was complaining about the room smelled like urine odor. I switched her to a different room on a different floor and she still saying the same thing. This time I had my houseman check the room to make sure that the previous room are what she said they were, but everything is normal. 
I upgraded her room to a king this time, but before I put her in there, I made sure the room  is inspected and odor free. And you guessed it, she complains again about the new room smelling like pee. 
I was ready to tell her that id be more to happy to refund her reservation and have her find accommodations elsewhere if she asking to switch room again. She didn’t ask to switch room but asked for disinfected spray or lysol to clean the room herself. Let me know what you think I should’ve done instead. Thank you!",13,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF5AD700>
181,My biggest weakness: I dissociate everytime I have to make a over the phone reservation,"I would probably say making phone reservations are my least favortie part of working the front desk. I am not like anxious or anything I've been working at hotels for 5+ years. I think its the fact that I am working the desk solo dolo and making an over the phone reservation takes up my time and I have to put them on hold to help a guest in front of me. Then take/make the reservation after finishing with the guest while my phone is screaming at me that someone is on hold.

I go into a full disociative state. I dont want to hear the back story or the lore behind why you are making the reservation or what brings you into town. Just wanna know what dates and what type of room you need, followed by reservation details.

I feel bad when people are telling me that their husband, dad, brother, wife is in the hospital and I don't even skip a beat, ""So what day did you need the reservation for?"" I know this makes me sound like a dick, but I don't think I can help it (also I already dislike my job, I dont need to be feeling sad and shit lol). I've recently realized that I am like this and now let out a awkward and pathetic ""Oh I am sorry to hear that"" (If you have any advice on go to words for this situation let me hear it cause I am lost haha)

I also just hate the whole proccess of it most of the time. The only reservations I like making are for companies as they just give it to me straight. This person, is staying for this amount of days, just needs a king bed and it will be direct billed.

182,Work has been giving me write ups over every mistake,"I've never had this happen to me before at any job and this is my first job working at a hotel. Been working for 7 months and was fine until recently got my first writeup . Definitely my fault should have been more careful. Received second 3 weeks later and am shocked. My hotel has no set guidelines and is very lenient. My GM let's people with free nights if he's cool with them and in other cases we don't charge late checkout.

There is no set protocol of what to do on certain things and my GM goes based off of ""use your best judgement"" but using my judgement gets me in trouble. I extended someone when we had the availability and let the other person paying for her know  that he would need to fill out authorization form or need to be there (this is whay I was taught)

No one told me this but they wanted her out of there apparently and I got in trouble because I extended her when I shouldn't have. I've been struggling because nothing is ever clear when it comes to authorization or extending and there's over 100 different scenarios where it's okay and not okay. I always ask questions and take notes I feel like im going crazy? Different people say different things and I get in trouble. It gets very confusing. 

update: just checked the pass on notes,, apparently it was on the notes but my GM changed his mind twice. On the first part he said yes she can stay one more night then all the way down he changed his mind again and said no she can't stay any longer. I guess it is my fault but people have made worse mistakes and have no gotten written up for it which is still weird to me",25,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF5AD7C0>
183,Happy Guest and lessons on making assumptions.,"A while back, pre-Covid….

One day I’m at the FD and two late 20 something guys walk in looking like they are sponsored by a surf company and just getting in from a demo. Definitely not our typical 30th anniversary type guest. 

I greet them and they ask if there’s anything available. We chat a bit and I show them a room because I had the time and liked their vibe. During the tour one of the guys tells me they’re on a road-trip up the east coast, no real agenda, just a bucket list trip for 2 best friends & the other guy let’s me know he just lost his dad. Basically they were working through some stuff while road-tripping. 

We get back to the desk, I get ready for the “so what can you do for us?” question that most walk-ins try. I give them the price and they both paused and blink at me… we are not cheap, but that’s pretty obvious when you get on-site. But at this point most walk-ins tend to walk out.
Guy 1 looks at guy2: so this one you or me? 
Guy2: I got this one, you got dinner last night.
Guy1 yeah but you got the last… 
This goes back and forth a minute but I always hate these conversations and offer to split it if needed.
They both pause and smile at me… (oh sh*t, I’ve insulted them…) 
Guy2: can you make us dinner reservations for 8, and can I see a wine list?
Me: yes sir. How’s 7:30p? 
Guy1: perfect, do we get breakfast? 
Me: with the room, yes. We include afternoon tea also. Are you AAA members? I can do a small discount if yes? 
The both look up like I was speaking Greek.
Guy1: tea, for real!?!
Me: ugh yeah, it started a few minute ago and goes til….
Guy2: can I get the key?
Me: I still need a CC and ID.
Guy2: oh yeah, one sec…
Guy1: “oh snap!” As he proceeds to drop and AMEX black card on the desk victoriously.
(I give them the sad 5% AAA discount anyway because I’d already put it in the system) 
I proceed to check them in and they leave. About 30 min later they come up for tea.

They are clearly both on something, eyes are saucers, both grinning ear to ear, and moving at the pace of someone who is on alternate timeline. They say high and proceed to tell me how lovely the water is right now. (It’s New England in November, it is not lovely) they sit for tea and giggle like children through the whole thing. “Pinkies up” was the tea motto that day, they even had other guests going along with them. They go on about the beauty everywhere and that people need to appreciate it more. On the way out they thank me again for the tea. And remind them it’s included. (Who knew this would be the key amenity for these two!) I’m just thankful their substance of choice made them happy and not into A-holes.
They are clearly getting the most out of the property they can. 

7:00pm roles around and dinner is humming along, I get a call from their room and they asked if we had a few bottles in inventory, I check with F&B to confirm and they ask to have them ready for their 7:30. We arrange it, chilled or decanted as needed with one to be left corked till requested. They come to dinner and proceed to drop the most I’ve ever seen for a party of two in our restaurant. Apparently those were just the starter bottles. And they did some damage to our liquor list too. 

On their way out they stop by for a chat, ask about check out and say I need to talk to the server before I leave, which seemed odd so I asked if everything went ok at dinner? They both reply with a oddly cold “yes, thank you.” (Ok what happened…) 

End of the shift I go talk to their server. She proceeds to fill in the details about them, their travels ect. Apparently she got the full life story and an invite to CA, along with 20% tip (wine included) Ok, but why did they say to come see you. 
Server: Because they left you this…
As she produces a gift bag from the pair. It contained a beautiful thank you note, Brooks bros. tie with boats, and a one of the bottles they had pre-ordered. Which happens to be the most expensive bottle I will ever enjoy. (Chateaux Lafite Rothschild, forgot the specific year but early 2000’s, yes I drank it, yes it was beautiful, and yes thought about selling it first.)

They departed before my shift the next day. They ended up taking care of everyone who helped them out, and tried to personalize each gratuity they left. Housekeeper who mentioned her new baby got a tip equal to the room price & pack of diapers. Valet got $ and some new designer sunglasses (one of them was actually sponsored) because he forgot his. 

The wine is gone, the tie is torn, but I will remember those two forever and hope they are both still spreading joy and appreciating the beauty around them. Still have that thank you note.",24,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF5AD820>
184,Guest asking for reservation opinion,"At this front desk, we're not allowed to take reservation calls.  Since I've worked various other hotels in this chain, I know *how* to do this, but the agents who started at *this* location do no know how to even do that.

There were very few check outs this morning, so I was taking care of phone calls.  I don't know why, but at this location we receive calls about everything from how close we are to the airports to what type of hamburger is served in the restaurant to what convention is in town to how far areyou to a particular city on the other coast to what time does the sun rise?  It's a random hodgepodge of stuff every day!

Anyway, it's about 10am Friday morning, and I've been dealing with phone shenannagins for three hours now.  The week has been insanely busy from both staff requests and guests. As a side self-promo, I pride myself in sounding neutral on the phone at worst and excited for the guest at best.  

I took a call from a woman who called to say she didn't know how to make a government rate reservation.

The queue to speak with a reservation agent is about a 20 minute wait and you have to wade through about five layers of autoprompting.  Thinking this was going to be something I could take care quickly, I said I would be happy to show her how do this over the internet and asked her if she had internet access. 

She did, and I walked her through the process, and lo and behold, there were no government rates  available that night- we'd sold out of the allocation.

(w) But we need 10 rooms at the government rate!  It is important.  We are going to the convention center.  

(me) Well, as we have both seen, there are no rooms left at this hotel at the government rate.  The next nearest hotel is across the street.  [and using my neutral voice] It takes about seven seconds to cross the 20 foot wide [6 meter] street.  Think of an uppercase T- the convention center is on top; this hotel is on the left; the other hotel is on the right.  Other hotel is a newer and very nice hotel as well and also [the same parent company]

(w) I can't have that.  What would you do?

And this is where I lost it in my head, but not my voice!  After a week of absolutely craziness. I boarded the opinion train and didn't get off.

(me) Well, I would stay at the other hotel.  It's newer and nicer; has the government rate.  It's the exact same distance to the cc.

(w) (interrupting)... I want to stay at this hotel!  I don't understand why the rate is not available.  I need to have the government rate!

(me).  It seems, then, that you have a decision to make.  Is government rate more important to you or is staying at this location.  You asked me what I would do:  I would stay in the newer, nicer hotel at the government rate.  I walk across that street every day twice a day and it takes me about seven seconds to cross.  I don't have a mobility disability to worry about-- does any of the people you're booking for have a mobility disability?

(w) ...no...

(me)  Then, ma'm, I would stay at the other hotel.  It gives the rate you are looking for and is the exactly the same  distance to the cc.

(w) But I want to stay at (this hotel).... Can't you book my rooms at government rate?

(me) Unfortunately not, ma'am.  I cannot override the government rate allocation.  And we do not offer waitlists.

I went on:

(me) It sounds like you have some thinking to do.  Which is more important to you and/or your team?  Booking at the govt rate or being at the hotel?  You can't have both so it sounds like you have a decision to make.  Think about it for a while and talk with your team; and when you have made a decison, you can either call the reservation line at XXX or book the rooms online at XXX.  I have given you my opinion and can help you no further.

(I pause for a moment)

(me) thank you for calling (hotel) and I hope you have a good weekend.",21,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF5AD880>
185,I just wanna say; working in a hotel that doesn't care about you sucks ass.,"For some context, we've recently had our policy changed so that we're not allowed to use the internet at all on our front desk terminals. This is at a location where we are never allowed to leave the front desk except during graveyard where we're only allowed to leave to go do the bell desk or house keeping runs. No cleaning rooms thank God.

So now we're expected to sit through an 8 hour shift, and regardless of how busy it is or isn't just sit there and look pretty. No fun on the job. Absolute no joy will be allowed.

Did I mention we're not allowed to stay at our hotel? Oh but they said they'd give friends and family a discount. Go figure. Overtime goes without thanks, and we're bleeding out in the graveyard shift. Might be because there's no differential pay so no one wants to do the hard shifts.

I've half a mind to go back to serving.

Edit: For clarification, everyone is getting paid overtime as due, the issue is that management doesn't seem to care that people are doing the overtime.",61,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF5AD8E0>

187,Getting Out,"After never having a holiday off in two years (name a holiday, I worked six+ days!)…

After losing my paid time off at the deadline every single year because I never had enough staff to give me time off…

After cancelling every plan I’ve had in the last three months, such that I am still driving on summer tires in the winter because I couldn’t even keep a damn tire swap appointment…

After 3 full weekends of having to cover NA shifts due to last-minute callouts, when I was already scheduled 60-70 hours a week…

…I have given my notice and accepted a job in an industry that locks the doors Friday afternoon and doesn’t reopen until Monday morning.

A lady called me in the third hour of my 16-hour overnight asking to talk to “Nimrod.”

I asked, is that a guest?

“Yes, transfer me please.”

No nimrods in my system.

“He’s staying at the Nights Inn, just transfer me!”

Ah, you’ve called the Worst Northern Inn.

“I know, do you speak English?!  Just transfer me!”

There’s no need to be rude, ma’am.  (Are you a moron?)

“Are you even in Narnia?  Transfer me to the front desk.”

I am at the front desk ma’am, of the Worst Northern.  You are trying to reach a guest at the Nights Inn.  You’ve dialed the wrong number.

“No, I dialed Nights Inn.  Let me talk to the front desk.”

189,Scared of Women in Charge.,"I have had a few post on here explaining the sales manager and her antics that lead to the GM quitting. Today was the GM's last day and now the hunt begins for a person to fill the spot. But they're not looking for any ol' person. Nope, they're specifically looking for a man. It has to be a man. No matter how many no matter how many qualified women apply it has to be a man. 

The Regional Manager stepped in today as active manager, and immediately started changing literally everything. The schedule- changed. Not to effect his hours. He just wanted to do it himself and he didn't like the format anyway. 

We now officially can't make reservations at the desk. We have to send them to Central Reservations. Only, we can't call it that. We have to call it our reservations department. He already bitched at a coworker for calling it Central today? 

My younger brother is the other night auditor there. The RGM says one of us should be let go because it's a conflict of interest to have us both working with the company. (Sales Manager has he daughters working under her.)

Despite being their best rated hotel we now have to do everything exactly how all of the other properties are doing. We just had a review come in today saying ""don't change a thing"". Obviously the upper management knows better than the customers about what the customers want.

The AGM is going to a new property to discuss pay rates and how many of her staff she could move into positions there. She just asked me today if I was coming with her when she left. While two other members of the desk were standing right there with her. 

Meanwhile the sales team is trying to start things by sending bitchy emails about things that aren't even mistakes, just things they don't like. They send 'notices' to make sure we know how to do our jobs. 'Notice: Make sure the front desk greets each person with warm hospitality!' 'Notice: Make sure the front desk can give ample restaurant recommendations to guests, people will need dinner!' We know how to do our jobs. We actually work in the building daily, unlike our property sales person who lives over an hour away and comes in twice a month- often working out of office so she doesn't have access to our PMS so she sends all her work our way.",26,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF5ADA60>
190,Better luck next time Mr. P,"*Before I begin my tale, I wanted to thank everyone here that takes the time to share their stories and insights. I’ve learned more about working in hospitality and how to respond to strange situations from reading the stories shared here than any of my actual “training”.*

A little background, I work for a two-star hotel (common hotel brand with a shiny status membership) off of I-95 as a night auditor.

My story begins near the end of my shift. It had been an unusually peaceful night and I was in a fairly chipper mood because of it.  Around 6:40am I received a call from a man that supposedly had the same last name as the owner of the hotel (and many others if you can already tell where my tale is going). He introduced himself as an employee of the over-arching big brand name that our hotel belongs under, and began his lightning-fast introduction as to the purpose of his call. My hotel was apparently supposed to have a ‘surprise Covid inspection’ that we just ‘had to pass’, and we were going to be receiving several packages of sanitizing and Covid supplies.  🚩

*Although my experience in Hospitality was less than a year, my BS meter was tingling. However, because my position as an NA gives me very little notice to the goings-on during the day (AKA, no one tells me shit), I decided to treat the call as if it were legit – just in case.*

The man proceeds to have me write down a ton of information – the number of packages we were to receive, the items listed in each package, the shipping/tracking numbers, etc. He's quizzing me every so often to make sure I have the exact information.

At this point, I have to put him on hold because several guests are wishing to check-out and all want printed receipts. He got upset with this  🚩 🚩   but had no choice if he was to continue his façade of working for the big hotel name brand. After a few minutes, I return to the call.

He asks for my name and my manager’s name,  🚩  🚩  🚩 , and I proceed to give him only my first name and just the last name of my manager’s name – I did not even give him the title of Mr./Ms./Mrs. because I did not trust this person or the story they were trying to sell me.

After having me write down some more useless information, a Nokia ringtone blasts through the phone. The man states that it’s my manager (who he gendered incorrectly because I didn’t give him their title) returning his call and that he was going to speak to them on the other line. They make a big show of having a conversation with them *(which at this point, I know this is a scam call as my manager doesn’t get out of bed before 9am unless the hotel is literally on fire*), and proceeds to tell me that my manager would like for me to ‘listen carefully and follow all of the scammer’s directions because this was so very important and my job would be on the line otherwise’.

At this point I was over this person wasting my time and knew without a doubt that this was a scam. Playing along that he was apparently speaking with my manager, I asked him to speak with my manager about giving him their first name to pass along to me, as this was their policy in assuring me that all was legitimate (a lie, but I knew this would be their nail in the coffin).

It was then that his entire attitude changed. He began screaming at me about how rude I was and how DARE I speak to HIM that way! He told me I was fired and to leave the hotel immediately!

I couldn’t help but giggle and told him that I didn’t understand why he was so upset with me when I was just following my manager’s policy, who could assure him of the same thing as he was still speaking to them on the other line!

He didn’t like this response and proceeded to scream and cuss (very poorly) at me. I told him better luck next time and hung up.

**Teel Dear: Scammer attempts to defraud the hotel and doesn’t make it past my BS detector.**

**Has anyone else had any experience with this sort of thing? Any other scams I should be on the lookout for?** I ask because neither my coworkers, AGM, or GM, knew anything about it and I’m thinking I’m going to have to type up an info sheet for all of our new hires.",36,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF5ADAC0>
191,Am I the asshole?,"I had a lady try to check in under her husband's name. She was combative up front, and when I offered to call her husband or member services to add her to the reservation she said ""you suck, this place sucks, I knew this would happen, blah blah blah"". My first reaction was to say ""if you're unhappy with your policies if you'd like I can offer you a free cancellation and you may find accommodations elsewhere"". Boy was this the wrong thing too say. She called member services herself and came back fuming once I got off the phone with the agent. She said ""I didn't do anything to you and you told me to go away, you were very rude and they agent agreed with me and was shocked by your behavior!"" Guys, I'm pretty sure she's gonna report me and since she's a member she will leave a bad review. Am I the asshole here?

I'm at the desk and the phone rings. FG- former guest, ME- obvi

Me- insert standard greeting.

FG- so this is going to be the most random phone call you get all night.

🚩🚩🚩

FG- I stayed at your hotel a couple weeks ago and ordered Domi-hos while I was there. I just ordered Domi-hos for my home and accidentally ordered it to the hotel. Idk if anyone is  in the room and got free pizza, but if not, go ahead and help yourself.

Me- which room was it?

FG- *gives room number*

Me-(internally) score! (I had just been in that hallway and seen Domi-hos boxes outside the door)

Me- we do have someone checking into that room, but it is presently vacant. I did see the boxes in the hall, so i will go up and grab it.

FG- thank you! I'm so sorry for the mix up, but go ahead and enjoy it!

Me- you're welcome... and thank you!

So now I'm out back, enjoying some free pizza.

193,My last week as FOM (long),"So people always ask what it is like working at a high end hotel. So here’s my last week on the job. (Highlights only) 

Sunday: 8:00am greeted while walking into property by an upset guest storming back to their room, upset that they came down at 7:30 and weren’t seated for breakfast promptly for breakfast and were told they would have to wait. We start service at 8:00am.

Brunch: the valet is backed up and I’m parking cars for 30m to clear the line and catch them up and not F-up the remainder of the brunch service just because those apes don’t know how to move cars effectively. 

While doing this I get approached by someone who was looking for me to plan his proposal. Said he was told I was the one who handles these things (I don’t) and that I can help him work out the details ( I can’t, she’s your girl, get to know her then maybe I can help). Turns out it was my reservations manager, he enjoys telling people this because he didn’t want to deal with them. I proceed to help him out a bit, but suggest he maybe get another opinion from her bestie. 

FD: calls me while I’m talking to fiancée wannabe, because “someone is asking for me.” Turns out 20 minutes earlier my GM was calling for me…. “Why didn’t you tell me this earlier?” Her: “you looked busy” 
Me: We all are busy, I still need to know if OUR boss is looking for me. 
Her: “oh, ok.”
Me: *stunned silence*

I go check in with the GM, who was just following up on my notice and what state the overall team was in ect. Meanwhile his phone rings. “Yeah, he’s with me.. ok, I will let him know… tell them we’ll be right down.”
Me: “everything ok?”
GM: Yeah, valet needs you to talk to some upset guests. Apparently they broke someone’s car. (Yes the car broke but it was horrible timing or a scam. Transmission crapped out and would not go into drive but the car was 15 year old at least and not we’ll maintain. still not the way you want to to start your last week)

Monday: Off 

Tuesday: Off… just kidding, closer called out, you get to cover.

Wed: lovely day, until Karen causes a scene about not having a same day spa appointment available despite repeated  suggestions/communications that we require at least 24hr notice on all spa requests. (Very small spa, no FT therapists) “Karen” informs me of how smart she thinks we all are and how wonderful she thinks property is, and also tells us of her future travel plans. I thank her for the feedback. 

Thursday: Notice the 2 overbooked rooms I flagged a month earlier are still scheduled for the upcoming Sunday. Reservations manager asked if I could call the people he overbooked and explain there was a “Plumbing issue” and we have to change their room. Said sure. (Ok I got petty because he did this to me a couple time before, but I did call them, informed them of the mistake made and that if they had and questions ect. that they should reach out to “Reservations Manager.” I then made sure they both got 20% off the new rate, some snacks in the room and a $300 bottle of champagne.) 

Friday: Arrivals for an almost buyout. Party shows up at 11am looking to check in, Bride and MOB have meltdowns that their rooms aren’t ready. Check in is 3pm, oh and check out is 11am, they also knew the rooms were occupied and needed housekeeping because I was the one who told them that the night before when they called and demanded to speak to a manager about their early arrival needs. Also general chaos with wedding parties and our dining traffic. 

Saturday: Glorious day. For real, most of the guest were occupied with wedding stuff, chilled with my recreations team on the beach for most of the shift. (What, like they’re going to fire me) 

Sunday: FD calls the office saying valet needs help. I go to the lot, they had managed to crash 3 cars in one incident. Valet was in a rush and thought he’d put a SUV in park, but it was neutral. The car backed itself down the small hill, took a hard left to take out our split rail fence, clip the front quarter panel of a 2 week old BMW suv, and come to rest courtesy of a late model GMC Yukon’s back corner. Two of the three parties were really good about what happened, got contacts ect from them and assured them we will make it right. 3rd party hits the roof, threatens to sue me, the valet, the hotel.
Her:I’m a lawyer from NYC, you’re going to pay for this.
Me: Ma’am I just said we are taking responsibility for this. 
Her: But it’s a brand new car.
Me: we are taking responsibility and going to make it right. Please get us a quote or call you insurance company and we can deal with them if you prefer.
Her: I’m not calling anyone! YOU ARE GOING TO FIX MY CAR! 
Me: we will make this right, but either you or insurance will need to get us a quote.
Lady pulls her phone out and demands I say we are taking responsibility for the accident. Which I do, because we were.
Her: see I told you I would get you to fix this. 
Me: Yes ma’am. You sure did.
Her: WTF you just say to me! 
Me: Sorry, just that I agreed with you.
Her: Oh, right then. - walks away to use the bathroom. 
Her from across the very full entrance: This better happen fast or you’ll be hearing from my lawyer! (Me looking puzzled) What did you not understand me, I’m contacting them now!
Me: No ma’am, I understood you, we will be in touch. 
Her: I want your card! 
Me: Ok. 
Her stunned it was that easy: you will be hearing from me. 
Me: I doubt I will be, but you have the hotel and GM contact info. (Already provided)
Her: what’s that supposed to mean.
Me: Well, after today, I will no longer be working hear.
Her assuming they just fired me: Good, at least someone in this place has a brain! And you got what you deserve! 
Me: Sorry again this happened. 
The entire valet team then, individually, proceeds to wish them a good day, safe trip, and to come back soon. (Any other day I would have killed them, that day it was hugs) 

But the best send off were the two guest who I called earlier that week. both called to thank me for being upfront about the rooming mistake and one left me a lovely card. That they were both sad to hear I was leaving and asked where I was going. I found out afterwards they both called the GM to complain about the reservations mrg. :) 

Sorry this was long but I was inspired by all you. those were some of the highlights of my last week at that property.",10,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF5ADBE0>
194,When you expect a 5 star hotel paying for a 2 star Inn,"One evening, working at the Inn next to a main road in a popular tourist city of the Costa Brava region of Spain. Like every evening, I was typing in the remaining customer data before submitting it to the authorities. We were fully booked but one room haven't shown up yet. 

Thirty minutes before we close our check in, a brand new Mercedes pulls into our small parking lot. I can see how from the inside emerges an older lady, in her 60s. She enters the building without any baggage and heads towards me (I need to clarify that, by that time, I'm the only worker in the whole building). And this conversation starts:

Me: Welcome to th.....

Old Lady (OL): Where is the porter?

Me: Unfortunately we don't have that service in our Inn.

OL: What do you mean you don't have that service? All the hotels I was at before had it.

Me: Well, we are a small roadside Inn, we can't offer you any luxuries, but we do have one of the best kitchens in the city.

OL: Oh, I don't care about that. Who is going to carry my suitcase for me?

Me: It will, most probably, have to be you, ma'am. Do you have a reservation? (trying to speed up the process before the system locks)

OL: Ughh, what kind of hotel doesn't have a porter? Yes, I do have a reservation.

Me: Under which name?

OL: Old Lady

Me: Great, I can see that you payed it through our partner website. All I'll need is your passport or ID to finish the check in process.

OL: (hands me her ID) I don't understand how can you have such a poor service.

Me: We do what we can, with what we have, ma'am. (Return her ID with the key to her room) Here is your key, room 102, first floor, second door on the right.

OL: (disgusted) What is this? (Pointing to the key I layed on the desk in front of her)

Me: (confused) The key to your room.

OL: Where is the card?

Me: What card?

OL: The card to open my room?

Me: Oh, no, we don't have electronic locks, you need to use this key to access your room.

OL: WHAT? First you tell me that you don't have a porter and now that I meed to use A KEY for the room? What kind of hotel are you?

Me: We're the 2 star roadside Inn you booked your stay at, ma'am. 

OL: (as she grabs her key and goes to her car for her suitcase) UNBELIEVABLE

I go back to type in all the remaining data. I can see how she comes back with her small suitcase (yes, she needed a porter for a small suitcase, the size one uses for an on-board baggage on flights) and marches towards the stairs.

One hour later, as I'm in middle of closing of the restaurant (the front  desk of the Inn was the counter of the bar too) I can hear behind my back:

OL: EHEMMM, excuse me.

Me: Yes? What can I help you with this time, ma'am?

OL: I can't find the hairdryer.

Me: Ehm, unfortunately I can't help you finding your hairdryer, ma'am.

OL: No, I mean, I can't find the hairdryer in the bathroom, the one you provide for me to use.

Me: We don't provide individual hairdryers in our rooms. If you didn't bring your own, ma'am, I'm sorry to inform you there is no hairdryer for you to use.

OL: WHAT? How am I supposed to dry my hair? Every hotel provides a hairdryer. How do you people stay open if you don't know how to serve your customers?

Me: Ma'am, if you're not happy with our service, you're more than welcome to bring your complaint to our manager tomorrow morning during your check-out. 

OL: You can be sure I will.

As she turns around and storms back to her room I add:

Me: Have a great night, ma'am.

195,Shots Fired!,"I posted a story yesterday about my days as a switchboard agent, and it inspired me to tell more. My property had a lot of crazy things happen. This is not a story that happened to me, but a retelling of a story my old Duty Manager (I’ll name him Jared) told me. 


A number of years ago, Jared had just been brought on as a bellboy. One hot August day, he left his post at the front to use the bathroom.


Moments later, a car pulled up to the driveway of the hotel and unloaded their gun onto a rival gang member who had been standing near the entrance of the hotel. I can still point out a bullet hole in the building. Anyway, the bellboy who was manning the post yelled into the radio “SHOTS FIRED!!! SHOTS FIRED!!!” And got the hell out of there. 


Now Jared was, as he recalls, pants down taking a shit, when his radio crackled, and out of that very outdated device came “S***…FIRE*…. ***TS… FIRE*!!!” All he heard was fire- and so he promptly got out of the bathroom and ran towards the entrance, as that was the fire drill protocol. 


However, as Jared ran to the front doors, he noticed that the staff, the guests and their dog were all running in the opposite direction. By the time he got to the front, he was the only one. Jared saw a guy on the ground, the car with the gun, and booked it back FAST the direction he came. 


In the end, the man who was shot died, and the people responsible for the murder were caught and jailed.",15,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF5ADCA0>
196,"Lesson learned today, keep the doors locked no matter what","So this just happened.

We have doors that I lock at night which I manually have to open with a button. Guests can use the side doors and get in with their key cards but not the main entrance. We have had repeated issues where people don't check to see if we have a room, get dropped off here, and then stay here for hours under the guise of well I have nowhere else to stay. I have confirmed with my managers that guests that are not staying with us do not need to be in the lobby during these hours and that they need to leave if they do not have a reservation for guest and staff safety.

Two cars pull up at like 2:50am. A couple gets out the second car and stands at the door to which I greet them and ask how can I help them. They don't use the mic to talk to me and just stand at the door talking to me. I can't hear them so I ask if they're looking for a room and they shake their head yes. I shake mine no and say into the microphone that I am sold out. They stay at the door and keep talking to me despite repeated attempts to instruct them to use the microphone so i can hear them. I don't understand anything they're saying. I wonder if there's been a misunderstanding so I make the fatal error of allowing them in to clarify. Sigh.

I explain again we are sold out (duh, if you had called or booked online you'd know this already). They don't have a reservation. They're asking me to repeat myself and squinting at me. The guys speech is super slurred and hard to understand. They're likely intoxicated but I can't tell if it's alcohol, weed, or something else because I don't smell anything. Or maybe they're just like that? Who knows. I hadn't realized the car pulled off and it's not actually their car. Must've been an Uber or something. I told them to check the hotels that are less than 5 mins from us hoping they'd leave. They sit down and the dude slumps over. I tell them that there's hotels nearby and I can't have them stay here, the doors are locked for that reason I only opened them to clearly speak to them. They refuse to leave. I more bluntly say, ""I need y'all to leave."" They refuse again. I realize at this point theres no car at all. So they just stuck themselves here without a reservation thinking they can just hang out in the lobby while they wait. Idk if you've ever tried to call Ubers in a small city at 3am but they don't pick up. 

The car that was previously in front of them steps out and comes in. An older lady seeking a man asking if he was here at the hotel. I tell her i can't provide guest information and to file a police report if she's worried about a missing person. I ask her to leave and she does so, no question. 

I turn my attention back to the loitering couple that keep making phone calls. I decide to give them some time to figure it out. Surely they'll leave soon. 20 minutes pass. Still here. I ask if they found a place and they say yes. I them they need to leave either wait outside or the restaurant that's 24/7 down the road, less than 5 minutes away (the hotel is right next to everything, a ten minute walk to the pharmacy even). The guy who was already obviously agitated by me and escalates it further and is yelling about why dont I leave myself and see how easy it is and im like.. wut. I ask them two more times to leave. He refuses. So i said ok and just called the police. They shouted obscenities but went without much issue. The whole ordeal lasted about 30 minutes.

So fellow night auditors. If people ask you for a damn room and you clearly say no, do the common sense thing and do not allow them into the lobby.

197,The Ever Changing Story,"Greetings and salutations,

Back to the Legal Garden we go circa 2019.

I’m working the afternoon shift this day and all is uneventful for the first hour and a half.

A man then walks in saying he just called and we told him we had rooms.

Red Flag 1 and 2.

No one had called yet on my shift, but benefit of the doubt, maybe he has a loose definition of “just”, or maybe he called a nearby hotel of the same brand.

That said, guests that say this when no one has called, lean towards the sketchy.

I ask the guest if he is sure he is at the right location, to which he confirms.

I then begin the standard check in procedure.

The guest says it’s just him and his daughter.

When we get to price, the guest then asks about two days.  Then four.  Then a week.

Red Flag 3 - Guests that do this are sketchy.

While this is going on, two women dragging garbage bags enter.  One of whom has a severe case of meth face.

My thought is, after checking in the man, to close out sales and hope that they don’t have a reservation.

Back to the male guest.  After asking about a weekly rate, the man says his dad is in the hospital dying.

Red Flag 4 - While guests use us due to being close to a hospital, this was said way too casually.

The guest then asks about a government rate.  I inform him it is $X with a government work ID.

He then goes over to the women and starts digging through the trash bags.

Red Flag 5. - Now I know it isn’t just him and his daughter.

The man then asks about AAA.  I tell him it is $X with a AAA card to which he says he left it in his car.

While this is going on, Methany is back by our bartender sitting in a booth waiting for his shift to start.  She gets right up in his face…no closer…no closer and asks if he has a phone charger.  She then comes up to me and does the same to which I tell her to step away from the desk.

The man then asks what the regular rate is again.  I inform him it is $X, $Y(incidentals), and $Z (parking-which we charged for a few months until our scores tanked).  When told of the parking fee, the man now claimed he didn’t have a car.

Red Flag 6

One of the women then says we told them we have a discount for hospital 1.  I tell her we don’t.  She then asks about Hospital 2.  I tell her we don’t.  She then asks about Hospital 3.  Again, I tell her we don’t.

Red Flags 7, 8, and 9.

The trio then talk amongst themselves, and I check another guest in.

I then use that as an excuse, saying their behavior is concerning other guests and that their story has changed multiple times, to refuse service.

They are upset and question why again, but they do leave once they realize they are out of luck.

If the women stayed outside(Edit: Apologises for how sexist that sounds),  I would have been none the wiser, and if the man could have kept his story straight, they could have had a room.  At least until we would need to evict them.",14,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF5ADD60>
198,Airline training,"Edit: I just realized I used to call “Brad” “Chad” when I wrote about that Helliott property, this is Chad.

Day four at my new property and I’m already here, hey y’all. Long story short, I hated my first property in AZ, got a front desk job that paid the same out of desperation, wasted three months where there’s no opportunity for me, within the hotel or company, and now I’m at an airport Shmilton brand with Brad from my first AZ property. I specifically applied because I’d be working with Brad again (plus a sweet pay raise of $2.50/hr) and y’all will see why, he’s a saint.

Anywayyyy

First day here, we have 90 arrivals for Northeast training. Northeast is paying for rooms, their new employee is on the hook for incidentals, 25% off our f&b markets, housekeeping every 3 days for their 40 day stay, bus service to training, blah blah blah. Everything was explained to them in the welcome letter WE wrote because Northeast had nothing prepared. I’ve never worked with this system so I’m just sitting around chilling and learning.

We had 5 meltdowns about the incidental holds. Northeast never told them. Some of them didn’t have the money, hence why they got a job, so that was fun. Deep down I’m an empath, but especially day 1 I have to follow policy. 

The next day we had a woman yelling at us that housekeeping messed with her stuff. Housekeeping never entered the room that day. Today housekeeping lady came back to scream at me again, and would not let me leave to handle her issue. Yay.

Then I had phone lady (LD) her rude friend (RB) and a random old lady (OL) yell at me further because LD made about $80 worth of long distance phone calls because her phone was broken, and she doesn’t understand how calling a city in New Mexico would be considered a long distance call from Arizona, much less why a hotel would ever charge for calling. Told her I’d ask the manager, walk in the back, “hey Brad, I’m back here just pretending to talk to you about this lady asking for a refund for her long distance calls to New Mexico, she’s upset that hotels charge for calling.” He actually offered her $40, she’s not liking it. 

RB then starts saying that she “doesn’t know the legalities in this state” but in some places that would be considered false advertising and she would be speaking to someone about that. Yes, because we have signs in the room that say “free phone calls!” LD continues to cry in front of me with puppy dog eyes while RB starts raising her voice, Brad comes out and tells them that’s all he’s gonna do and they’re lucky they got that, but it’s standard practice in most hotels, no I can’t get you a receipt because I’ve completely removed the charges so they won’t even show up, have a good night. 

LD storms off crying, I have to argue with them about why we are settling their accounts on Friday and still holding $100 for incidentals, RB waves me off to get Brad, who then comes out and says “the issue isn’t even yours, you made my agent (me) feel some sort of way, and I’m sorry it didn’t go your way but your behavior is not going to change the outcome, you were rude, raising your voice, and made my agent feel uncomfortable and it won’t be tolerated any longer tonight.” She tried arguing that she wasn’t being rude or mean, that I was (“ma’am I was sitting around the corner and heard everything, you were why I came out.”) and sent her away.

OL then comes up and says we are shady and deceitful because every hotel has a “responsibility paper” that you sign at check in that gives you the terms of your stay. “Ma’am we gave that to Northwest and they were supposed to give that to you. They didn’t give any of you ANY details for your stay. Nobody knew they had to provide a card, nobody knew about scheduling, laundry, room charges, anything, and they were supposed to tell you this. I PERSONALLY typed the letter with the information about your stay that you ALL received at check in so that you had a copy.” “Well, I’ll be speaking to Northeast about this!!” In true Karen fashion.

I told Brad we should be taking down our problem rooms and speaking to Northeast about their behavior, especially since they are footing the bill as this is giving them a bad image to our other guests (thank you TFTFD) and he said he will bring it up to the GM on Monday.

My overnights can’t come soon enough.",19,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF5ADDC0>
199,"Well, fuck you too","My Lord, these stupid pricks who think they are important. Some guy walks in looking for a friend, allegedly. 

Douche: Can you call x for me?

Me: Do you know his room number?

Douche: No.

Me: Then I am sorry, but due to security reasons I cannot even confirm if that person is here or not
.
Douche: blah blah blah

Me: perhaps you should call on your phone

Douche: yada yada. I just told you I'm his friend 

Me: Sir, I don't know you and do you know how many times I hear that daily?

Douche: this is fucking bullshit

Me: be that as it may...


Douche ostensibly calls friend.  Oddly, he leaves and never comes back.

Tl;dr?

If you aren't on the reservation and can't give name and room number, the guest doesn't care and fuck you, I care even less.",75,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF5ADE20>
200,"If I were a mind reader, I wouldn't work at a hotel.","FOM for an independent hotel in Ohio, college town. Pretty much every weekend during school is sold out, and the #1 question I get is this: 

""Do you know if anyone is going to cancel?!?"" 

My response? ""With all due seriousness... if I knew that I wouldn't be working here.""

(As an aside we tried a limited waitlist at one point but it didn't work because no one canceled and then the people on the waitlist yelled at us because they didn't get a room.

201,"This terrible, this early into my shift","I've been here for approximately 90 min and one room has succeeded in making my life hell and ready to rip them a new one. Besides being extremely loud this late, they've called an upwards of 15 times not being serious and laughing into the phone. I stopped picking up their calls!! 

What has me ready to go off on them is this room full of white frat dudes are referring to each other as n***a and being black that shit does not fly!!!!!!

I am burning up inside and just feel like having the cops come get them cause I can't deal with this! 

I didn't even know it was possible for me to feel this vile this early into my shift on a day that's supposed to be slow since we're sold out, but nope.

This is only prep for what is to come. Spring break is around the corner and I am absolutely ready to ruin every single one of those college drunks' nights. I'm the same age as these people and can't imagine myself causing this much trouble for staff anywhere!


Edit: the night has only gotten worse as i heard them say it again, I spoke to them and they lied to my face and as I walked back down the hall i could hear them joking about me in the room. I went downstairs only to receive a phone call from a guest we walked earlier just tearing into me and the hotel that he ended up at and our supervisor lied to him about why he had to be relocated so that made matters worse when I ended up telling him the truth unaware of what was said earlier. I'm ready to go home.....",14,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF5ADFA0>
202,I'm too much of a hard ass,"A 3rd party guest comes in, and we start the check in process.

OP: ""Alright, so if I can just see an ID and credit card for incidentals, I can get you checked in""

G: ""No problem""

The guest starts rooting around his pockets, and only pulls out a credit card. 

OP: ""Awesome, now I just need an ID""

G: ""Oh, well, I was touring apartments earlier and forgot it. Does a picture work?""

He proceeds to show me the blurriest picture of an ID I have ever seen. Suddenly, I am brought back to my teenage years, reading the Fault in our Stars. The Treachery of Images quote pops into my head: ""This is not a pipe, a picture of a thing is not the thing itself"".

OP: ""Ah, I'm sorry sir. Do you have anything else with your picture and name? A costco card? Work or school ID?""

G: ""No. Just take the picture""

OP: ""Sorry sir, I can't. That is not your ID""

g: ""It's a picture of it!""

OP: ""That may be, but it is not your ID""

G: ""Stop being such a hard ass about it""

OP: ""I am going to need a picture ID sir""

Guest grumbles, and storms off.

203,"Back at the night shift, need opinions","I've been a NA for a long time, back during 2020 I was let go as part of covid lay offs and I decided to take a break from the industry, especially because there were a lot of problems and everything was really intense. 

This year I threw my hat back into the hospitality sector and got hired by a smilton property. I haven't worked for one before and I just have to know if anyone else has worked this ancient software and weird audit before? This is probably the most high class place I've worked in 3 years but the weirdest front desk set up I've ever seen. Besides that the staff seems to be jumping ship as I'm hired. The manager I spoke to when applying left the day I was supposed to interview and a corporate guy who travels to a bunch of different properties seems to be subbing in, the night manager is leaving Friday for good, the wonderful 2nd shift guy who was training me got fired and they're pulling people from a property in another city to fill the gaps. It seems like a burning ship and I'm wondering if smilton is always this nuts? I can usually coast under the radar and avoid the morning drama but it's just a lot chaos and I still have barely any idea on how to really do the audit because the training is terrible.",21,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF5ADF10>
204,Baby in the hallway,"Recently read a post that reminded me of a situation that happened back when I was working switchboard in front office. 


It’s the evening, guests have checked in and it is pretty quiet at front desk. My manager is manning the front alone. Suddenly he comes into the back with a bewildered look and says “Uh, a lady found a baby in a hallway!?!”


This lady had discovered a baby- around a year old- just crawling around the hallway. She looked for the parents but nobody was there. She said she waited for a while in case someone would show up, but since nobody did she brought it to the front desk. 


I can’t remember exactly what we did with it, but eventually a grandma came to the front office, distraught about a lost baby. Turns out, she was babysitting for her daughter while she was out and fell asleep on the couch. The baby was at the age that it was standing and propping itself up… We think it leaned against the door handle, fell out, and the door shut behind it. No clue how long it was out there though! Thankfully the lady who found it had good intentions, and the baby was reunited with the family.",24,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0B30F10>
205,Birthday Surprise,"Hello everyone. I work at a resort property and most of our guests are pretty good, but I just had the best experience with a guest ever!

So I was helping this couple yesterday and this morning when they mentioned that it was the wife's birthday tomorrow and that's why they were visiting.  I then smiled and told them that today was my birthday so we were almost twins. We had great conversation and then they went out to lunch.

Well a few hours later I'm about to pack up my stuff when they come back. They make a beeline over to my desk and pull out a birthday card! I was so thankful and happy thinking that they just spent their time to get me a nice card and I loved the sentiment. Then I opened it, and there was a giftcard! I'm just so happy right now. It's rare to get such great guest interactions and I wanted to share the happy side of the job.

206,Never fails to amaze me how people try to get out of paying or for getting a discount.,"A little while ago I made a reservation for a family and the only room we had that could accommodate them, well, it was the only room we had, was our “penthouse” suite. Top floor. 3 bedrooms, mini kitchen, minibar, etc. very nice suite.  It was expensive like $500 per night. But they agreed and seemed happy with it. 


When they got here they were extra demanding with housekeeping, wanting it every day but our policy is for every three. They did the same thing with their car, sometimes asking for it a few times in one hour. So the valets weren’t happy with them either. Not tippers. 


Finally they checked out and we were glad to see them go. Until they called and since I’m a manager now it got transferred to me. They wanted to complain about their bill. It was too high!  They wanted some money taken off. 


Why?


They didn’t use the 3rd bedroom!  They didn’t use the whole suite! So by their logic they shouldn’t have to pay full price. Right??  


You can all hear how that conversation went. I was flabbergasted by the end of it. Just. No.  No. No. They even tried to insult me and who I work for as a ploy to get me to refund part of their bill. Seriously how did they think that would go? Call me, or anyone, a harpy or a pig and do you think I’ll just bow down to your demands?!  You agreed to the price. End of story and do not come back.

207,“I can do whatever I want!”,"I got this phone call from a lady who booked her reservation one month in advance for 7 nights. She’s coming in tomorrow and she wanted to modify her reservation that instead of coming in tomorrow(Thursday), to come in on Friday. Her reasoning to change her reservation? She doesn’t like our check in time is at 4pm and she doesn’t feel like checking in that late if her flight is super early. 

She booked it with my manager and I know my manager always tell them their dates, total amount and our cancellation policy is 3 days in advance. Our cancellation policy also applies to changing dates. 

I told her of our policy and that unfortunately in order for me to change her dates I do need an approval so she won’t be charged for tomorrow. She gives me an attitude and starts whining how “if I can’t even change my date to the next day I might as well cancel my whole reservation and not spend my money there!” I tell her if she wants to cancel she will be charged the cancellation penalty.

She was very upset that I told her I would have to charge her regardless.

“This is unacceptable! I can come in whenever I want and I can leave whenever I want. If I want to stay for 5 nights I can and if I want to leave as early as an hour I can! You need to change my dates or I will need to speak to a manager about this”

Well ma’am you made this reservation a month an advance for seven nights. You’ve taken the room from potential guests who know that they actually want to stay!

I just repeated to her that we sent her a confirmation of her reservation that comes with the cancellation policy and our check in time- which she has read since she clearly knows it is at 4pm!

She lies about her reasoning to change her dates and I went a long with it because at this point my manager probably would’ve done the same and I was tired of her tantrum.

Soon after we get an email from her saying how upset she is that I changed it to the next day when she wanted to change it to next month. She’s not happy at how flexible out front desk staff is with customers and I was extremely “bitchy”.",25,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0B320A0>
208,I found a baby,"No. I really did. 

So it all started when my happy ass decided to do a property walk at 2 am (I was working audit that terrible night). 
I am a good soul (I think idk who knows) and I go outside to check on cars to make sure nothing bad happened or anything like that. 
I notice a white sedan that had its engine on. Okay. No worries. Probably some guest that is coming right back. I continue my little walk. 
I go to the hotel next door (dual property) and chat with the auditor over there. 
I head back to my hotel and notice the white sedan is still running. 
I shine my flashlight in the vehicle. 
I stand there, stone cold, as a head twitches in the back seat. Twitch. Again! Twitch. Now my heart is racing. Who the fuck would have Annabelle in the back seat. Wait. No! It’s not a cursed doll! The thing is breathing. Sucking all the available air out of the confined tin can. 
I yank out my phone and call 911 immediately. 
“911. What’s your emergency?” 

“Yeah. Umm. There is a baby in a vehicle and I’m not sure where the parents are.”

“Is the vehicle on?” 

“Yes”

“Did you try to break into the vehicle?”

“No. not yet”

“Okay just stand near it and I’m send medics. What’s your address?”

“Sure. It’s *** ********”

“Great. Like I said just stand near the vehicle and emergency units have already been  dispatched and are currently en route.”

“Thanks ma’am” 

I hang up. By this time my hands are sweaty. I need to pee. No! No Ryan. You have to stand here and watch!! 
I pace back and forth in front of the sedan as I hear the sirens approaching. Thank god they are close. 
A police car races up to me, followed by an ambulance, then a fire truck. 
As the police officer breaks into the car, more and more police show up. Okay, so now we have seven cop cars, two ambulance, three fire trucks. For one baby? Sure. I don’t make the rules. 
After the baby is safely retrieved from the vehicle, we try to go on our security tapes, but thanks to our wonderful management company, they barely work (also 480p?? Eww). 

Fast forward a few weeks.

A police officer that I recognize walks into the lobby of the hotel. 
She catches me up to speed on the case. So, apparently they found the baby daddy next door to our hotel with a prostitute. How lovely. And to make things worse (better?) the mom didn’t know the baby daddy took the baby 40 minutes away to a hotel.

We love good families

211,Customer Pettiness,"Sometimes guests do things on purpose just to be petty or because they're angry, and it really pisses me off although I try really hard not to showcase it to them. Because, ultimately, that's why they do it, to see your reaction. 

This morning, a young woman approached the desk, holding something small wrapped up in more than one super dingy looking blankets, not wearing a mask, not even standing behind the barriers we have at the desk. Her hair was all out and crazy looking, but she'd tried to put it back into a ponytail. She was very tiny, wearing nothing but a flimsy worn out tank top, pajama shorts, and flip flops. She was also holding a piece of paper in her skinny hand and had just gotten her nails done because they were exaggeratedly long and blinged out. Going out to the desk, I'd assumed the paper she was holding was a receipt and she was going to ask me to print her out another one or explain some charges on her account. But, no. 

I go out there and say, ""Good morning!"" and she immediately rambles off with her eyebrow cocked, ""I'm checking out"", and nearly tosses the piece of paper across the desk to me and says, ""I need you to dispose of this."" I look up at it, and it's one of our No-Smoking letters all crumbled up and dirty. We are a completely non-smoking hotel, but some customers think they can just crack open a window, cover up the smoke detectors (or take them down), or stuff towels under the doors and they can sneak some cigarettes (or whatever else), and no one will find out. 

Because our air vents are all connected somehow to one room or another, no matter where you're smoking in the room, *someone* in the hotel is going to smell it and alert us. When that happens, we are to walk the floors, sniff out the culprit and if we can, we stick a No-Smoking letter under their door that says something along the lines of, ""If we see any evidence of smoking in your room, you will get charged for it."" So we warn them, give them a chance to stop, and if they don't we charge them. 

So she was clearly upset that it had been put under her door and came up to the desk with it to hand it to me and tell me to ""dispose of it"" just to feel like she did something. I took the letter from her hand and simply put it on the desk and continued pulling her reservation up in the system. ""Did you need another copy of your receipt?"" I asked her. Nope, she starts walking away with whatever is in her arms. I go to walk back to my own office, and she then goes, 

Her: Um, what's that short gay boy's name that works up here?

Me: That short who?? 

I thought, surely she wouldn't say that again. 

Her: That GAY boy, the one with the glasses that works up here. What's his name? (She literally emphasized the word ""gay"") 

Me: I have no idea who you're talking about. 

I didn't give her the satisfaction of correcting her about her attitude towards who she was referring to, and simply turned on my heel and walked back into the office without a second glance back. The nerve! So I went to her room myself after she left to make sure they hadn't smoked in it, and BEHOLD. They'd had a DOG in there, a rather big one, I would think. And they'd gotten hair ALL over the room, furniture, and had even bathed the dog in our tub that morning because there was black dog hair lining the tub and the shower curtain too. Not only that, the dog had chewed up one of our sheets, and there was still some dog food on the floor in the corners of the kitchen. Their room reeked of cheap cologne that was obviously meant to mask the smell of the smoking they'd done too, but we found no other evidence other than the cologne. Huge bags of trash that literally had not only garbage, but ruined clothing were lined up along the wall right by the bedroom door too. 

After we charged her folio the pet fee and the fee for the new linen we'd have to buy for the room (can't wait to get a call back to her about those charges), I looked at the notes and saw that the staff member she'd checked in with (the one who she asked me about), had already had issues with her at check in because she couldn't receive the government rate because she/or whoever she was with was not active duty. He is also the associate who put the letter under her door when he received complaints of smoke smell coming from their room. So her referring to him as ""gay"" and asking for his name, was simply her being derogatory, and petty. 

What you need to do is ""dispose"" of that attitude.",24,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0B32220>

213,Group from hell,"I was working my usual night audit shift one weekend and the hotel had welcomed an entire group of college aged kids here for a dance competition.  Friday night the entire group proceeded to act like they owned the hotel.  They were in the atrium playing loud music while practicing their routines.  They were running back and forth between rooms causing several noise complaints.  There were five that had hopped over a locked gate and were just lounging in the jacuzzi.  I was supposed to be off Saturday but talked my bosses into overtime to help the new auditor. 

Saturday night they were warned to not repeat Friday’s performance but despite promising to behave they were all at it again.  Desperate calls to the chaperones were futile.

216,The Parasites in Room 315 - *MAJOR UPDATE!!!*,"DING DONG THE WITCHES ARE DEAD (evicted) 

About a week ago I made a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheFrontDesk/comments/sxhlv9/the_parasites_in_room_315/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) about the parasitic mother & daughter duo who were basically robbing the hotel in front of our faces. My GM has been working on collecting evidence to justify having them blacklisted from the entire area however this morning the cops were finally called on them!!! 

To make a long story short  a guest saw them apparently walking out of their room completely naked. The FD called the cops,  however when the cops came they refused to let the cops in. The cops came back down for a key & during that time they apparently snuck out the back. All their stuff was & still is in the room. 

The amount of towels  & toiletries they had stolen overfilled 2 of our large laundry carts. I now have full permission to call the cops on them the second I see them step onto the property. 

I shit you not as I started writing this my GM saw them out her window drive by the front entrance, see it was me working the front desk, & speed off of the property. The past few weeks they have gone out of their way to avoid seeing me bc they know I was the only one at the FD who called them out on their BS w/ receipts (hence why they have reported me to corporate multiple times & have tried to talk to my GM about getting me fired lmaoooo)

As of now all their stuff is still in their room & they can only retrieve it w/ the cops & our GM watching. If they try to come back onto the property again I will go full Karen on their asses & call the cops the second I see them leave their car. 

They have apparently been kicked out of 3 other hotels in the area.. they are literally a traveling circus bringing their chaos everywhere. 

I shall gladly keep y'all updated if they try to show up tonight, I honestly kinda hope I get to call the police on them & see them get arrested for trespassing. Bit disappointed it wasn't me who got to call them this morning however my coworker who did have to deal w/ them is literally in law school rn so she's probably more aquipt to be dealing w/ situations like this lmaoo. 

I didn't realize how much having to deal w/ them has been affecting me but I feel so relaxed rn & more engaged w/ new guests. They were literally like a chronic toothache constantly in the back of my mind bothering me. Not once today have I been anxious to answer the phones either, I don't have to worry about getting yelled at anymore. I'm so happy rn",56,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0B32400>
217,"Define ""external call"" please","We have a new colleague at our front desk. When we taught him how our phone works we told him:

&#x200B;

*  ""To call a room press 2 before the room number"".  

*  ""When placing a external call, press 0 before the number.""   

*  ""To transfer a call press this button here, input the number, and press it again.""

So the other day he was alone in the reception for a while, while I was having diner. When I came back he was just finishing a phone call, and looked very confused. 

""Hey u/pikachuisyourfriend , this strange thing keeps happening. I forward a call to our central reservations, and soon after the same number calls me saying I passed the call to a guest in the hotel!""

""...What? Show me you've been doing.""

We ran a little simulation with my phone and discovered the problem right away. Our central reservations number starts with 2101, and he thought it wasn't considered a external number, so he was transferring the calls to room 101. :)",9,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0B32460>
218,“Tell me what i need to do….. i don’t want to do that”,"Woman: yes hi. I have two reservations for today and i have some other people who will be checking in. I want to pay for the room, and i just want to know how i can make sure that happens

Me: ok, so if you’d like to pay, you can always do an online check in, or you can send us a credit card authorization form to ensure your card is used. 

Woman: what?

Me: if the card will not be physically present you can do online check in, or fill out and send us a cc auth form. 

Woman: i don’t understand. What’s the second option?

Me: a cc auth form. 

Woman: what does that mean?

Me: it’s a form that gives us authorization to use your card for charges here without it being physically present. We send it, you fill it out and send it back with a copy of your id and cc. 

Woman: welli don’t want to do that. I have to leave. i’m on the phone right now so i don’t understand. 

Me: if the card isn’t physically present we need this to verify. If we don’t have the form we can’t check anyone in without another card. 

Woman: well then you need to send it right this second because i’m busy and don’t have time for this. 

(She huffed and puffed the whole convo. I send it over. About 30 mins later she calls back)

Woman: well i sent it over. Check for it. 

Me: ok, let me refresh… i don’t see it yet. You just sent it?

Woman: yes!

Me: to our email? (I spell it out just in case)

Woman: well i don’t know what the issue is and why i even have to do this. It’s my credit card and you should know it by now. I’m here on the phone telling you this so i really don’t understand what your problem is. 

Me: we require the form so we have proof of authorization from you to use it, and it provides proof to your bank that you gave us permission to use your card without physically presenting it. This is a procedure every single guest who stays here is subject to for security reasons. 

Woman: ughhhhhh. Well i sent it over. If you have an issue just call i guess. I have to leave now after this inconvenience. 

Me: ok thank you i’ll keep checking

10 mins later the email shows up. She uses aol so no wonder it took so long lmao.

219,"So it appears I might have landed my dream job. Night Auditor in a 5star 300-400 room All-inclusive Hotel in a large island... in which I always wanted to work/go. Problem is, I am terrified.","I have to quit my current too easy front desk ""job"" in a 3 star hotel (3 years), where I am an afternoon receptionist (alone in shift), this is what scares me

This one offers double money for same hours, plus will look good on resume for future and several other benefits

I have already worked in a 5star hotel for 7 years, but I was a bellboy, the tips where amazing,  but regular pay and conditions where awful, also very old 30 room building (build around world war 1) renovated and repurposed to 50 and dine 300 made it a nightmare to do anything involving heavy lifting

Plus, BellBoy was not my only duty, I was doing full Concierge duties when there was 

I was working 16 hour shifts, 7 days a week, 8 months a year

I do not fear the night shifts, I am a night owl anyway, and not addicted to coffee anyway

The accounting stuff/end of day procedure is what scares me, I made it absolutely clear that I never did complex audit things other than just pressing a button for the credit card machine on the few night shifts I did but they don't seem as concerned and said they will train me and that I will do some shifts with another guy before going on my own

The hotel has 4 bars and 4 restaurants, and mistakes of this magnitude are worth more than I make in a year

Anyway, maybe I am just paranoid and blowing it way out of proportions but this thing makes me not be able to get proper sleep 3 nights now",27,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0B32520>
220,"""Can you ask the people next door to be quiet?""","Years ago, I was working the night audit on my own and we had a bachelor party on the second floor.  Naturally, you expect a noise complaint or two with bachelor parties, so when the phone rang and the guest in the room adjacent complained, I wasn't surprised.

""Hey, the people next door are being really loud.  Can you ask them to be quiet?""

The exact wording is important here.

I apologize for the disturbance and go upstairs to address the issue.  The hotel I worked at was long and L-shaped, and the elevators were clear on the opposite end of the building from the room in question.  But distance be damned, as soon as I stepped off the elevator, I could hear it.

Screaming.  I'm talking bloodcurdling I'm-getting-murdered screaming.  It sounded like an audio excerpt from the Saw movies.

I stopped in my tracks for a second from pure shock, then made my way down the hall to the bachelor party's room.  The screaming did not stop, and when I approached the door I could hear a few other voices talking urgently back and forth to one another, but only one man screaming.  I knock on the door, and almost immediately the door opens a few inches.

The guy at the door has an absolutely terrified expression on his face.  The screaming is still going on behind him.  ""Hi,"" he says, and he looks like he might be trying not to cry.

Obviously, my normal script for addressing noise complaints is out the window.  I ask, ""What's going on?  You need to tell me right now.""

As it turned out, one member of the bachelor party was a recent return from deployment in the Middle East and had seen very intense combat.  He was in the middle of a full-blown PTSD flashback and had no idea where he was or what was happening.  His friend at the door (the groom, I think) shakily explained that they were trying to snap him out of it, that they had just shoved him into a cold shower to try and bring him back to reality, and that he was so, so sorry for the noise.

He says, ""If you need us to leave, we completely understand.""

I told him that I might have to do exactly that, only because I'm required to also consider the comfort of all the other guests and we were sold out, but added that I would give them some more time to help their friend come out of it.  I ask, ""If I *do* need to ask you to vacate, do you have somewhere nearby that you can go?  The last thing I want is to jeopardize his safety.""

The groom nodded and said they had relatives in the next town they could stay with if need be, and I told them I could allow another half an hour.  After that if he wasn't calm they could either take him to their relatives' house or I'd call 911 and have him taken to the hospital.  I felt absolutely awful having to even suggest they leave, but they were completely understanding and I went back to the desk.

Thirty minutes later, I called up to see how they were doing and the groom told me that their friend was fine now and was getting some much-needed rest, so I didn't have to evict them after all.

All these years later and I still cannot get over the noise complaint.  Not ""someone's screaming next door; I think there's an emergency.""  Not ""hey, I think we need to call the police.""

Just, ""Can you tell them to be quiet?""",64,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0B32580>
221,Caught a guy sleeping in the lobby. He decides to cop an attitude with me while asking for help.,"For context; in the lobby we have these little nooks with a couch and TV for our guests. The problem with this is that the last two nooks are not visible from the front desk.

So it’s around 6 AM, near the end of my shift. I usually unlock the door around 5 AM since that’s when guests start coming in and out and our breakfast cook gets in. I am walking back to the desk when I see a man sleeping in the couch in the last nook. I go over to him and he is SNORING. I tried yelling to wake him up and when that didn’t work I had to shake him. When he woke up he told me to “shoo”. I told him “I am not leaving until you get up. What are you doing? You cannot be sleeping in the lobby?”

He then tells me, “I think I have a room here.” So I respond with “Oh you think? Let’s find out.” Obviously I knew he didn’t have a room but I decided to humor the situation. I ask him what his last name is and gives me a super common last name. I pretend to type it up then tell him “You don’t have a room you need to leave.”

About half an hour later he comes back. I ask him to leave and he says “Well can I get a room?” I give him a puzzled look and tell him no. He asks me why. I describe the situation that happened 10 minutes previously with him. Then he asks if there is a manger here. I tell him that it’s not even 7 AM yet and it’s a Saturday, and even if there was a manager here they would tell you the same thing.

Before he leaves he hesitates and then asked if I can at least call him a cab. I felt a little bad for the guy as he was obviously down on his luck and reach for the phone to call a cab. He says “Wow is that so hard?” I respond with “Yep, it is. Get out right now.” He then starts saying that I should give him a break and that it’s too cold outside to walk and blah blah blah. I tell him to leave now or I am calling the police. Finally he leaves, not without telling me to “get f***ed”.

The audacity of people is unbelievable.

222,Guest Fell,"Guest \*redacted\* called to complain from a personal number. I answered and she said no one let her in the hotel or was in the lobby. This woman was in the lobby shouting into her phone on the couch. I came out and said hello 3 or 4 times, but she ignored me. She continued her phone conversation and I returned to the back.

She then complained that she had to let herself into the hotel via her key. She never pressed the call button and got in on her own with her key as we require most guests. (We're in a not great area.) She demanded to know where security was. I told her we had none. She ripped into me for that.

She then said she was having a medical emergency and needed assistance getting to her room and I didn't help her after she *ignored* me in the lobby. I told her if she needed medical assistance I can call an ambulance but we can't take on that liability. I am not CPR certified or trained to help someone in need. She asked if I was crazy for saying that.

*Again she ignored me when I went out*.

She then began insulting me. She said I shouldn't work here, that I never came out to greet her, despite having footage and reminding her I did come out and say hello back.

She then just started yelling at me, ""You're DUMB. You're DUMB. You're DUMB."" I told her if she didn't stop I would have her removed from the property. She hung up on me.

She had fallen outside of camera view. Had not mentioned it and, as mentioned, devolved into insults when I asked if she needed me to call emergency services. She ended up calling herself after the five minute phone call to me.

Is there anything I should be worried about?

&#x200B;

ETA: A cop just came asking if I was kicking them out. I said no...Apparently the guest called and said they need an escort due to PTSD. Waiting on an update from the police now.

223,Renting a room to a guest who's has no $ then calling the cops on them ...,"So... I get a phone call about an hour into my shift with a guest asking why we called the cops on her when she paid for her room.  Of course, this is news to me.  You'd think I'd be told something big like this from the previous shift, but that's an entirely different issue.  

Turns out, we checked in a guest who's credit card declined.  They ended up smoking in the room, so when it was noticed, she was asked to leave.  Of course, she wouldn't, stating she paid for it, and so the police were called to remove her.

I get the fallout phone calls from this ordeal, and with no information to go off, all I can do it take the verbal harassment.  After calling the employee who handled this and getting the correct information, it makes a bit more sense, but that does nothing for earlier me that had to fumble with this massive eff up.

Obviously the guest is cracked as she stated she paid in cash and had a receipts, which she clearly did not.  At least that was confirmed by me asking her what the total amount was, to which she stated ""why does that matter?"".

Long story short... I love my job.  I love my job.  I love my job...

226,"My first super-Karen this year reports me for being a ""mega-c***""","We're a smaller hotel (120 rooms) in the middle of my city and our hotel does not have an ATM. I actually get that question a lot and there's a bank right across the street so it hasn't been that big an issue--until tonight.

I'm doing audit tonight so I clock in and grab the reports throughout the day and am sorting them when Karen walks in. She was wearing a tight mini-skirt without a jacket and its 25 degrees outside. She is with a male with a half-smoked cigarette in his mouth.

K: Where's your ATM?

Me: I'm sorry we don't have an ATM and Sir our facility is non-smoking. Like I said we don't have an ATM however

K: That's not what they told me across the street (she's talking about a hotel across the street).

Me: I'm not sure what you were told but we do not have an ATM however

K: Is the ATM in here (knocks on our closed lobby door)?

Me: No, as I said we don't have an ATM there is however a bank next to the hotel you're staying at in fact.

K: I'm not staying there I need an ATM to get cash so I can rent a room HERE. So where is the ATM?

Me: Ma'am we don't have one here however there is a bank across the street with an ATM.

K: I'm not going back over there I JUST CAME FROM THERE.

Me: Well I'm not sure what to tell you we don't have one so you will have to go back across the street. However at this point I am not comfortable renting to you so I'm very sorry but I must ask you to leave the property.

Now, it was clear to me what I was dealing with the moment she entered the lobby. I was wondering when the Karen would emerge and it was right after I asked her to leave the property. Her face turned red and she open her eyes wide and stared at me for like 10 seconds. I've never had a Karen manifest that way before so I was a little rattled, not going to lie.

K: **W H A T  D I D  Y O U  S A Y????**

Me: I am not comfortable renting a room to you tonight so I'm sorry you will have to find accommodations elsewhere.

K: I'm not going anywhere you can rent me a room now and I'll be back later with cash.

Me: Actually I will not do that and I'm sorry but if you don't leave the property now I will have to call PD.

K: You know what I can do that myself how about that. You're in so much trouble (opens the night window door) TROUBLE!!

She got on the phone and tried to tell the dispatcher to get me to rent her a room. She doesn't understand why she is being denied service because I'm a ""piece of shit mega-c\*\*\* who is too stupid for this job"" etc. I think the dispatcher was telling her something alone the lines that we as a private business can refuse service to anyone.

I called dispatch myself and explained the situation and that I needed assistance in dealing with this lady. She was on the phone for about 15 minutes until the officers arrived. She didn't wait for them to come into the hotel she walked straight over to them before they could exit their vehicle. I started my paperwork again and glanced up every minute or so.

I'm guessing she was trying to get the cops to command me to rent her a room and they weren't and she was growing more visually frustrated. I could tell through her Karen sign language that she was trying to get them to do something for her. About 15 minutes later she comes back in and demands my name. I tell her she can get it from my manager after 7AM.

She heads to the lobby door and yells ""Hes not giving me his name, he's not cooperating with me."" She comes back to the window and said ""The cops are outside and I need your name now."" I tell her I don't have to tell her anything cops or not--she's not law enforcement and I already denied her service for obvious reasons and she needs to leave the property.

Shes goes back outside and a few more minutes pass by and one of the cops comes in with Karen right behind him. He asks me if I denied her service and I said yes and he asked why. I said her attitude and he just said ""yeah"" as he wrote that down. He then turns to her and tells her she is denied service and will need to leave the property as requested.

She stood blocking the entrance for a few seconds then said to the cop ""seriously? You're going to do nothing? HE WON'T LET ME USE THE ATM TO GET CASH SO I CAN RENT A ROOM! What am I supposed to do!?""

I asked the cop to serve her a no trespass order due to her belligerent attitude and refusal to leave when asked. I said we certainly do not have an ATM and she is accusing me of lying about that etc. When I've asked a cop to serve a no trespass order typically they'll give the party a chance to leave and if they return they will issue a no trespass order. This time however they just drew one up when I asked thankfully.

I'm guessing she'll try to make a bogus corporate complaint or harass the morning clerk so my report is all drawn up with the no trespass order attached in case she tries to come back and find our ATM.",149,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0B327C0>
227,Welp my kindness almost burnt my job down,"So this is a short one . And happened a couple hours ago.

So we had a guest come in last week that fucked our washer and dryer that is for guests.... So me being the kind person I am I escorted a couple long term guests into our laundry room to do their wash.

Welllllllll week later the dryer is STILL all dirty and unusable. I tell the guest to wash his clothes and then he can use our dryer.

About 30 minutes later he comes down and we go check his laundry. He insisted I restart it cuz it wasn't dry enough.

Now I do not touch guests laundry. I had a couple bad experiences with that so it's just my general rule..... But anywayyyyyy I didn't see what was in the wash until about 10 minutes later when I smell smoke!

Turns out he washed those hospital style bed pads which aren't meant to go in high heat dryers. My shift is almost done and he still hasn't been down.... And I get to tell my gm about it when she gets here. Yay!",8,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0B32820>
228,Mine Brother Becomes a Knight of Mine Court,"If you haven't read the tale where I was dubbed ""King of the Racists"", go do that now.  It provides a bit of context here. 

Done reading? Good. Because The Lady of the Vestibule hath returned, in a place least expected, and was most wroth with mine dear de facto brother-in-law. For he wouldst deny her loyal canine the comfort of his lobby. And for what reason, might you ask? Said knave of a hound didst choose to bark upon his customers.

Okay, let's be honest, it was getting tiring to write like that, and there's only so much I can take reading it, so I suspect you might be the same.

The Setting: The lobby of a business across town from my hotel.

The cast: The man who is the brother of my (now deceased) GF of...18 years? 19 years? We shall call him Bill(for Brother in law). Also, The Homeless Lady of the Vestibule, who we'll call Red, because that's the color of her hoodie. And Coworker, who we shall call Maiden Fair. And finally, the cops, who shall be called The Knights of the Realm.

It was a day like any other. Customers were demanding. Work proceeded apace. And then she walked into the lobby. He recognized her from my tales. It had to be her. The homeless lady in the red coat with the big dog, the infamous Red. She comes into the lobby and sits down, making no pretense of being a customer. She just sat down and started charging her phone.

Now, his business does not allow dogs. But Bill is bleeding of heart, though gruff of expression. Until you get to know him, in which case you become convinced that he is ""El Diablo, King of All Evil"". No, seriously. His company had him working in another city for a year, and that's what those who served him called him.

So, he decided that she was out of the way, not bothering anyone, so, what the eff, let her hang out, in contravention of normal front desk procedure. And he was the manager, so it was his job to decide.

I would have counseled otherwise, had I been there. Never give the homeless an inch. If you're feeling charitable, tase her and see if that helps charge her phone. But get her out immediately. But as I said, Bill is too kindhearted for his own good sometimes.

Another customer entered the lobby, and this hulking mound of pit bull begins barking. So Bill at last realizes his error, and asks her to take the dog outside. Not even leave. Just get the dog out of the building.

Red: ""No. I'm not going to leave just because you hate <race> people.""

Bill, now realizing that I wasn't joking when I told him how quickly things escalated with her: ""Please don't make me call the cops. Just get the dog outside.""

She screeches incoherently. He motions for the Maiden Fair manning the desk to call the police. The Knights of the Realm arrive. Red is trespassed.

Red: ""Just because this racist had to swoop in to rescue all these white assholes from being exposed to a <same racial slur I won't be writing this time either>! Like some kind of knight in shining armor, but he can't do it himself, so he calls the damn cops to keep a <race> girl down! I wasn't bothering nobody! And this is a service animal!""

Knight of the Realm: ""He wasn't the one who called us.""

Red: ""Don't lie to me. It had to be this racist asshole who called you.""

KotR: ""It wasn't him. Now get out of here before we have to charge you with disorderly conduct.""

And with that, Red scurries off into the night.

My other roommate, who we'll call Barnaby(no, I don't know why he likes that name), works FD at yet another business. And if you're bouncing around town in the pattern she seems to be, it's only a matter of time before Red makes her way to his business. So I'll let you know what happens. :P",20,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0B32880>
229,It's not any of your goddamn business,"Guy came to the front desk to buy some chips, and we had a conversation that I get at least once a month.

Him: What's your nationality?  
Me: I'm from here.   
Him: Yes, but what's your ethnic origin?  
Me: I'm from here.  
Him: So you're caucasian?  
Me: Yes. (I'm not). You're all set to go, have a good night.

I'm ethnically ambiguous so I get this question pretty often, especially from creepy guys lingering around at night (I'm an NA). Sometimes I just want to scream at them ""IT'S NOT YOUR GODDAMNED BUSINESS. I'M HERE TO WORK ASSHOLE.""",112,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0B328E0>
230,I’m over it,"Last night was not a bad night, in fact it was one of the chillest Saturday’s I’ve had. However, it made me plan my entire future based on the events. Small, annoying events that may have completely changed my life. 

I’ve been at my current property for a few months. It’s a shit show, a revolving door. I’d only been there for a week before I was cut loose to become a ‘supervisor.’ Our last night auditor abruptly quit, so by default I’m lead NA. 

We hire a new guy. Immediately, dude’s trying to take over. He acts like he’s been here for years and gets embarrassed when I correct him on literally anything. He won’t listen to me on anything, and refuses to do anything besides brown nose to management. 

I made the mistake of letting him know that I had a terrible anxiety flare up and now every complaint, every sigh, every sign of annoyance, is me ‘panicking.’ 

Last night, he tried to tell me how to unlock the front door. 

The door I’ve unlocked and locked a million times, the door he insisted did not have a latch that I latch and unlatch thousands of times. 

“I know how to open the door.”

Dear God, besides joking about him being high you woulda thought I cursed out his mom. 

I go to run audit and check out my left over due outs. Our accountant has somehow fucked up our routing so bad, one doesn’t have an account to withdraw funds from. The other owes 5k in /cash./ The accountant is PT at THREE different properties and keeps fucking up blocks like this. We are behind on bills from August. 

“If all it takes to being an accountant is showing up, I can do it.” 

The next hour I’m peopled out. Dude comes up to the desk to ask asinine questions, questions I would not have answers to because they dont pertain to the property. 

“How can we get to *city that we aren’t in?*” “Are there Ubers available?” “Can you give us a list of places to rent cars?” 

I realize during that interaction that, yeah, I could one hundred percent be an accountant. After some research, I realize it’s not really that different from my work now. The community college offers a CPAP focused curriculum and I can easily transfer to a four year and get an internship. 

I’m currently day dreaming about becoming the accountant of the hotel and having Mr. Manager answer to me. Honestly, seeing a way forward makes me feel so much better so in a way I’m thankful and feeling motivated.",32,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0B32940>
231,A short post for my last day,"I didn't think I would actually get any tales during my last 2 weeks, and I ended up making a couple posts. I guess I was naive to think that hotel guests would actually co-operate \*upside down smiley face\*

Today's tale is going to be short and sweet; exactly how the phone call went. 

Me: ""Good morning \*hotel\*, my name is blog\_magnolia--""

Asshole: \*cuts me off\* ""Yeah, do you guys take cash?""

Me: ""No, we're credit card only unfortunately.""

Asshole: ""Kay."" \*hangs up\*

232,Not even a full moon tonight...,"It's 3 a.m., Dude gets dropped here by the local casino's Security vehicle. He comes in asking for a room but being a weekend, you probably already guessed it - sold out. We keep a handicap-accessible room available for the off-chance that someone in a wheelchair books the wrong room type but given how drunk this guy is, my co-worker and I decide via eye-contact that we don't want to take the chance that he would pick a fight with one of our guests or trash the room or... whatever it is drunk people do to get themselves kicked out of casinos.

The grown man complains that the casino lost his $500 jacket and his keys and proceeds to be creepy toward a guest who's chilling in our lounge before we pull him away from her. We ask him to use the phone in his hand to find a room elsewhere and call a cab to take him there, to which he says, ""No, I'm not going to do that."" Suddenly his lost jacket appreciates in value to $25k as he repeats his plight for the 5th time. Meanwhile, I'm calling the casino security to find out what exactly happened and why they dumped him on us. 

It turns out that this man was asking security to help him find his jacket that may as well have wheels and an engine but disappeared before they could get any other information from him. Security found him at one of the bars throwing punches at other casino guests. Against policy, they actually offered him a room  while they searched for his missing coat but he refused to give his name for registration. The head security officer had taken his car keys to ensure he wouldn't drive drunk and the man insisted that he had rented a room at our hotel, so the officer drove him here.

We do our best to help him figure out transportation and accommodations, but it's like talking to a brick wall. 35 minutes later, Dude's still repeating information we had already ascertained about his missing items. We keep trying to explain why the casino took his keys and that they were going out of their way to help him regardless of the fact that he had been banned from the property... over and over and over.  He then stands there staring at us as if we're going to build him a room so I mention that if he doesn't make a move, we'll have to get the police involved to help him figure it out. His response again, ""No, I'm not going to do that."" \*eyeroll\*

He finally gets his Uber app open but the payment fails just as another man enters, super tired and looking for a room. I tell him about the room I had just found 20 minutes away in the opposite direction of his destination where we were hoping the drunk dude would order a cab to. As I'm talking I slip our traveler a note I'd scribbled that reads, ""We have to get this guy out of here and when we do, I have a room for you"" (the aforementioned handicap room). Obviously I can't just check him in with the problem child standing right there.

The weary traveler looks at me as if I'd just handed him a golden ticket to the Wonka factory and turns to the drunk guy asking, ""You need a ride? Come on. Where you going?"" And away they go. Our traveling friend brought the drunk guy BACK to the casino XD. I was confused at first as to what his plan was when I saw that light bulb illuminate over his head but it became clear when the casino security officer I had spoken to earlier called me to ask if  the drunk man-child (in not so many words) was still here.  The officer was asking because he had just gotten around to searching camera footage for this ungodly valuable jacket and paused mid-sentence.  I heard some radio chatter before he continued, ""Oh, I guess he made his way back here!"" He apologized profusely for the inconvenience to us and I heard the drunk guy apologizing to security before we wished each other a better day and hung up our phones.

This is the reason my best friend and co-worker dislike alcohol, and people in general. Why do we put ourselves through these situations by working in this industry? It's hilarious looking back especially the way it worked out, but in the thick of it all my co-worker and I could do was look at each other like, ""WTF?"" And keep going around in circles with the guy.

I'm on hour 15 of 16 for the shift and 39 of 40 for the week so please excuse any discrepancies in tense I may have used. Phew!",33,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0B32A00>
233,Guests and their back handed compliments,"I hate the people that be like:

""Oh wow this place looks a lot nicer than it does on the outside""

Oh thank you, you are so kind. Thanks for sharing your opinion that you think the hotel looks like shit but on the inside it looks nice. Its like saying, ""Hey you might be fat, ugly, and covered in pimples, but you are a great person on the inside""

I just never understand what these people are trying to do. I don't sense them trying to be hostile about it. But it is usually always a ""conversation starter?"" Which I don't know in what world they live in but I dont see a back handed compliment as a conversation starter. Like if someone did that to me IRL I'd slap the shit out of you.

""Hey u/jesusblewfatclouds. Thanks for cooking dinner. Food looked horrible, but tasted really great!""

""U/jesusblewfatclouds I read your post and even though it looks like it was written by a toddler I thought it was a good read!""

Just to make things clear I really don't care one way or another if you like the hotel or what you think of it. I just work here. I just think its more annoying than anything having somoene walk to the front counter just to give a back handed compliment. 

I cant think of anymore examples but it does happen quite a bit and is usually a different wording of ""it looks like shit on the outside but is pretty nice on the inside."" I bet yall have experienced these back handed compliments plenty of times",27,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0B32A60>
234,Is this a normal occurrence?,"So, I'm new to the hospitality industry (hired on at my first hotel November, did retail/CS before), and just had a... maybe weird event?

So, I'm night audit tonight. Come in, 50% occupancy (hotel was closed for most of 2020, and part of 2021, then had a nearly 100% staff turnover. I think we kept 2 housekeepers. 50% is exciting). Get my pass on, nothing major. 

Get a call from a guest, just checked in, never been up to the room, wants to check out.

Reservation was 2 nights, he checked in like 10 minutes before I clocked in. Quick 30-second check of the room verifies no one was in there, so I processed the check out.

Is that weird, of a fairly common thing? The FD who checked him in said he was a walk-in, too. (She was waiting on her Uber).

We're in the suburbs, near a minor concert venue (get some B-list acts, nothing major). Mostly get business stays. No major highways nearby.",20,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0B32AC0>
235,I Feel Like I'm Being Jerked Around (Short Mini Rant),"Let's start with some background.

236,So glad I'm leaving my job as receptionist forever,"Used to love my job but recently after various shitshows and horrendous management (basically doesn't exist) I'm choosing to leave. 

One of the worst thing I hate about my job is the people who's in charge of doing the rota/roster/shift pattern always takes forever.

Today is Saturday, new work week is literally starting in 2 days and no rota still. 

I never know what I'm working until 1-2 days before the week is due to start and I find that genuinely so appalling. Makes it impossible to make any appointments because you never know. 

I will be making a long post detailing all the tea I've encountered in this shitty place but I still have 2 more days to go...

Edit: also work never gives the rota, we have to ask for it. I have had colleagues not seen the rota and missed work as a result.",25,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0B32B80>
237,"""But WHY can you not take cash""","Working the PM shift at a mid sized select service big brand hotel. A woman came up to the front desk and got a bottle of wine from the market. ""How much"" she asks

Me: ""$38""

Her: ""for this shit? Really""

Me: *blink blink*

Her: ""okay fine"" *pulls out cash*

Me: ""I cannot take cash right now"" (I usually add the right now even though it's always because it makes guests more accepting)

Her: ""why not?""

Me: ""We do not accept cash. You can put it on your room and pay with cash when you check out""

Her: ""yes you can take cash""

Me: ""no I cannot""

Her: ""why""

Me: ""I cannot accept cash""

Her: ""why though""

Me: ""I cannot accept cash""

Her: ""fine put it on my room""

She leaves. Two minutes later he husband, clearly drunk from the bar, stumbles over to the front desk, her bottle of wine in hand

Him: ""take this off my room""

Me: ""sure thing""

Him: ""why don't you take cash here""

Me: ""because we don't accept cash""

Him: ""yeah but why""

Me: ""we just don't accept cash""

Him: ""is it because they don't trust you""

Me: *blink blink* ""...sir, the answer why will not change my answer nor your situation, which is that if you want something from our market you must either charge it to your room or pay with a credit card""

Him: ""you don't have to get snippy with me"" *walks away*

My temperament always matches that of the guest. If you're testy with me I'll be testy with you. We're changing management companies rn and that's why we aren't taking cash, makes the books easier.

(which makes me wonder what hotels people are staying at that just let's someone check in under a different name no questions asked. Alas, that's a discussion for another time) But my question is for anyone who works in an upper scale hotel that sees the famous, the rich, and politicians:

Do they ever check in under a different name and how do you handle that? I just can't wrap my head around how you would safely check the person in question in. I just... I gotta know.

242,My discount is manager approved,"We have had a guest check in for a few days per week for the last 2 months or so. At this point he is kind of a regular. I've checked him in nearly every time as he tends to shows up on my shift. I personally gave him a discount for CDL drivers a few weeks ago. We aren't ""allowed"" to give that discount unless we can verify it with their drivers license which has that designation on it. 

He assured me his CDL license was in the mail, as he owns a trucking company, and he'd have it in a week. Another clerk checked him a few weeks ago and also gave him the CDL discount. Last week he showed up and tried to get the CDL discount and I said sure may I see your drivers license. He paused for a bit and said ""uh, its still in the mail man you know how the DMV is with COVID, with precautions we can't be spreading COVID around."" 

I reminded him that a few weeks ago he told me he'd have his CDL license soon and he said the same thing, COVID this COVID that. I told him I'm sorry I can't offer that discount without credentials. He asked me what discounts we offer and I said gov. employees, military, or senior citizens. He said ""oh ok I'm military."" I asked for a military ID and he said he didn't have it on him after he checked his wallet and all his pockets. He asked me what government meant and I said state government or federal government--I went down the list and said first responders and he said ""oh OK but I don't have my firefighters ID on me--shoot-- my wallet was stolen"" as he checked all his pockets again.

I told him we need the proper credentials and he ""explained"" to me his wallet was stolen and he was in the process of getting all his ID's back and it would only be a week or so. I didn't say anything and he rummaged through his belongs again for about a minute and said ""really, I can't get a discount bro I'm on a budget."" He asked what the ""discount"" was for 2 nights and after a bit more rummaging settled for 1 night at rack rate.

Today my boss called me and asked me if I approved a CDL discount for said guest. I'm not management so I have no long-term authority to do so but apparently he was trying to convince my GM that the GM personally approved the discount for him. He said the same thing he owns a trucking company and his CDL is in the mail. He was trying to rent multiple rooms for his crew and was getting upset because my GM asked for a CDL license. 

He owns a towing company not a shipping company like I assumed however he didn't have the proper credentials and tried to strong arm my boss into a discount because the manager gave him a CDL discount. That ""manager"" was me and I got in trouble for it, not ""you're fired"" trouble just ""stop sending these assholes my way."" I try to help people out otherwise I'd just be a kiosk but maybe we should all be replaced by kiosks.",30,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0B32DC0>
243,We're Not Taking Deposits? Tell Everyone!,"Shady people - if you give them an inch, they're going to take a mile. Or cm/kilometer, for those readers in areas with sensible measurement systems.

Tonight, gentle readers, we shall speak of the problems that arise when employees don't follow procedures. Buttercup is napping, having had a lovely but energetic frolic in the field next door.

So it came to pass that I came in to work, and found two of the rooms had some very *loud* people. Not like, yelling and screaming or setting off fire works or anything of the sort. Just a bit louder than is considered polite for a hotel guest.

Loud conversations, doors slamming, kids running up and down the halls, that sort of thing. One gentleman was even having a loud speakerphone conversation in the hallway. Thankfully we were not too busy, so I didn't need to growl at anyone, and the banging around stopped about one in the morning, so all good, right?

Not quite.

I'd been doing my usual audit duties, checking the various folios and reports and all that, when I noticed that the two rooms were paying cash. Of *course* they were. Let's see if the person who checked them in followed procedure with regards to the credit card on file. *Shockingly*, they had not.

Cash room procedures vary widely between hotels. Many require a deposit of varying amounts. Or a card on file. Mine does, but in a roundabout way: the room *must* be checked in with a card. If the guest *then* wants to pay cash at checkout that's fine, but we need to have that authorization.

The reasons for this are simple - it keeps the shady people out. So what happens when policy is followed...? But I get ahead if myself.

So we had two rooms with a noisy family banging around. Word for the day: obstreperous. They have a card on file, but it's been declined for both rooms, and my coworker has gone ahead and checked them in anyways. Yay.

Of *course* they smoked in one of the rooms, but that's not the problem. Well, not *my* problem anyways.

The next evening, they had *five* rooms.

Absolutely *none* of them had credit cards. Not just not authorized, but not even on file. They were just as loud as before, of course.

But that *still* wasn't the problem.

Apparently, they had told their friends and family that we weren't really following any deposit procedures because in comes a walk-in who strongly fits the pattern established by the other group.

ID? Oh look, a pre-Brexit UK driver's license. Haven't seen one before, most international folks use their passports, but good enough. Card? Oh, here's his 'company card'. That doesn't have the name of the business on it. And a completely different name in it. Oh, well, can he use his wife's card? Is she here? No. He tries to convince me to let him in without a deposit, but no dice. I'm not not fooled, and I'm not impressed. Try the Motel Number.

*Thirty minutes later it happens again*.

In walks a young man in his twenties, with his girlfriend. They explain that their car broke down about ten miles away, and they had to take an Uber here, and he left his credit card in the car... Which would be extremely dubious to begin with, if they were not *also* matching the same pattern as the other folks.

He wants to pay with his phone app. Sorry, we don't take those. What about this photo of his card that he has on his phone? No, we have to have the physical card. What about her grandmother's card, that she has the numbers for? No, we have to have the physical card *and* the grandmother for that to work. They have also *both* somehow left their wallets with ID in the car, the one broken down ten miles away.

As the saying goes, pull the other one, it's got bells on it.

Finding me completely unmoved by their attempt at petty fraud, they grumbled off into the night. Getting into their car that they had parked at the end of the lot and driving away. Oh yes, I'd noticed.

Thankfully, that was the end of things. The manager let the whole group know that because they'd smoked in one of the rooms, they'd need to pay the smoking charge *and* a deposit for *each* of the five rooms if they wanted to stay another night. This prompted them to seek lodging elsewhere. 

Now if you'll excuse me, I need to go feed the unicorn before she starts giving me dirty looks and clearing her throat pointedly. Take care of yourselves, everyone.

244,COVID malicious compliance and getting even,"This happened during the start of COVID where they kept the minimum amount of staff and even the GM took a cut in pay and hours in order to not work the desk and have one more person. 

We had:

* FOS (supervisor) which had 5 morning shifts
* PM shift which had 5 afternoon shifts
* Swing shift 2 morning and 2 afternoon shifts
* NA relief 2 overnight shifts
* NA 5 overnight shifts

Something to note that the NA relief also had another job that he was let go from so he was collecting CERB (Canadian Employment Relief Benefit) and if he worked over a certain number of hours, it would come out of his government subsidy. 

I am the regular night auditor and was at this location for 4 years prior to the pandemic hitting. We let go all of our overlap staff and had only one housekeeper on. I had addressed the issue with the GM prior to the pandemic about the morning FDAs always being late. I had less of an issue if they called but the FOS never called, was always 5-10 minutes late, blamed traffic on the same road EVERY TIME, I mean at least contact me or come up with a slightly different story.

Anyways, we were supposed to help with folding laundry since we only had one housekeeper and she was not everyday either. We had cut off stayover service then, breakfast were breakfast bags prepared by me. I had also done extra help by mopping all the public areas and cleaning the public washrooms on my shift since the one housekeeper would be busy with all the check out rooms from a couple days and washing the laundry that doing the public space was one last thing she would not have to worry about. 

The other reason I did the public spaces and washrooms is I could mop the public space on the top floor in a few minutes, comeback down and check my cameras, go back up and sanitize the high touch areas and wipe down ledges in a few minutes, comeback down and check my cameras, go back up, change garbage and comeback down check my cameras. Then I could do it all over again with the next floor. Same with cleaning the bathrooms, wipe out the toilet and urinal, check the cameras, wipe down the sinks and mirrors and handles, check the cameras, change the garbage, check the cameras, do the next washroom and repeat. With our doors locked it did not keep me away from the front desk too long for security reasons. Or if I had a guest delivery or let in a smoker, they would not be locked out for too long.

Well I was informed that I had to fold sheets and towels on top of my usual audit work, the extra cleaning I was doing and preparing all the breakfast bags. The day I was told that I have to do it from the FOS (GM remoted in that day and was not on premises) they had something like 6 check outs, 3 arrivals set but the housekeeper had previous 3 days off so she had a lot of rooms to clean and laundry to do so she would be incredibly busy.

I come in that night, the morning person (FOS) did absolutely nothing to help the housekeeper. Additionally, the afternoon person literally laughed and said ""I did not want to fold sheets today so I did not do any"" and did absolutely nothing to help the housekeeper. Also, she only had the 3 reservations to check in and not many in house so it is not like reservations grew last minute, she was not busy. I thought I do all this other stuff to help the housekeeper and the other two cannot help - why should I break my back to do all this work if the others will not help either. So I did not do any sheets or towels and did my usual public area cleaning.

I got a scathing text message from my GM the next morning telling me we are all a team and have to pitch in where it is needed especially because the housekeeper has been incredibly busy (having one person do all the work and having a couple days build up makes her busy). I tried to call to explain ""hey, I do this, this and this. Also why do you not give your am and pm shit because they 'don't feel like doing it today'"". I called twice and she hit decline both times I called. I texted her to answer the phone so we can discuss this and she sent me another message saying we all have to pitch in and to not argue. I thought that is okay, I will maliciously comply with what she is asking. 

So the next day I folded sheets but did not clean any toilets or public areas. I know I was the only one doing it but fuck it. We have to all pitch in right. The biggest problem with me folding sheets, there is not a specific task that when done would signal me to go to the front and check the cameras. Folding a sheet if it was really tangled could take 5 minutes or I can do several sheets in a couple minutes if the ends came together properly. Towels can be folded like 20 in 5 minutes and I am not counting as I am going, so instead of being away from the front every 5-7 minutes at set intervals, this time some times creeped up to 20 minutes other times I was away for only 5 minutes. Unfortunately smokers were locked out and I apologized for the wait, same with food delivery. We had 5 cars broken into the following 2 months because I was away for the cameras at a longer period of time and I am not clairvoyant. But that was the nature of folding towel and sheets. Because I was able to also get done several dryers of laundry during my NA, both morning and afternoon shift did not help at all.

With the cars being broken into the GM had to start coming on site more often and deal with the guest complaints and get the information from the cameras. The FOS had to respond to the online reviews that bashed our property for these issues because I had to fold sheets. When the GM came in she also noticed that the public areas were quite bad. FOS had to explain that the housekeeper was too busy to do it and the GM was curious how it got done before. As we were still not busy (it would be 5 months into the initial pandemic when we would see a bit of an influx due to restrictions). She had to bring in another housekeeper (but it was the housekeeping manager which was even more money), before she should have to bring him in because of the stuff I was doing was not getting done. Additionally the housekeeper went form 3/4 days a week to a full 5 days. 

So I was actually saving them more money than they realized. Well I am still pissed off about this whole matter, particularly the part where I tried to have an open conversation with the GM about what I do only for her to purposed decline my calls. So when they hired more housekeepers back and we are doing decent (still far from full house) room numbers, we did not have sheets to do anymore to give that work to those that work in that area. The public areas still got ignored somedays and like hell was I going to do them. 

Anyways, as I said at the beginning, I got tired of no phone calls and the front desk being late all the time. I left the GM a note on three occasions (she was back full time) where I asked her to address the FOS being late. Because the GM is always late, she never did address the issue. So one day I got fed up, especially since there was no courtesy call, and punched out and left right on time. I left a note on the desk that said we were away from the desk and will be back temporarily. I left my pass-on notes from my shift on a print out piece of paper and just left. I had enough.

I get a phone call the next day from the GM, but guess what, she wanted to block my number so I blocked hers. I am not on call or salary so I figure she could call at 11pm when I am at work. Because I blocked her number, none of her text messages came through either. Because of this, and the fact that she cannot have ""nobody"" at the desk the GM had to address the late issue with the FOS. The next few months FOS was not late even once. and for the first week she was actually early by 15 minutes each of her shifts. 

A few months go by and I pop in to have a chat with my GM for something else. She starts to bring up the fact that I left the desk unattended. She almost stuttered when bringing it up because I knew it was on her mind but you could tell that she would not like the answer. I asked ""are you sure you want to go there. I will listen to what you have to say but you then need to listen to me.""

Her reply was ""you are actually lucky I did not tell <ownership> that you left the desk unattended. <ownership> would have flipped if he found out.""

Me: ""okay. do you have anything else to say""

GM: ""no, you are just lucky I did not tell <ownership>""

Me: ""actually I spoke to labour relations before I pulled the stunt of leaving right on time. They informed me if my schedule is until a certain time and you do not inform me then I am not required to stay - especially if it is unpaid. It is NOT MY SHIFT that was abandoned, it is the morning shift. If she had the decency to call and ask me to stay, I would have but she doesn't call. Not only that, it means I stay an average of 10-15 minutes past my shift that you do not pay me so I am NOT REQUIRED to stay by law. I was also informed by labour relations that if there was ANY RETALLIATION for me NOT WORKING UNPAID HOURS then they would gladly do an audit of all the time cards and see all the unpaid overtime, but go ahead and tell <ownership> because I am sure he would be happy to have another hotel go through an audit"" (side note that happened 8 years ago - 5/6 years prior to this and it put them through HELL and the audit went through the last 7 years of ALL their records).

GM: ""well I guess we are all lucky, but I cannot have the desk just empty. Besides we do pay when you stay late.""

Me: ""Oh really"" \*I put a shit eating grin on my face\* This was a couple days after cut off and our cheques were ready the day before and I had not deposited mine yet, ""Lets look at the last pay schedule.""

GM brings out all the time cards and her hours payment.

Me: ""Here I punched out at quarter after because the morning person (different from the FOS), called and was late. I show her my pay cheque and say, where is this 15 minutes?""

GM: ""well that is because you punched out at 14 minutes not 15 minutes so it rounds off, if you waited a minute and punched out it would have been added.""

Me: ""so if we look at the morning person who punched in 10 minutes late,"" (note: we have to pass on any information on from the previous shift for constant communication so it is rarely punch in and out right away) ""they would have lost the 15 minutes because it rounds off""

GM: ""well it does not really work that way...""

Me: ""right, we will just leave it at that, and if I am not given the decency of a call, again I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE for that shift and if it is a deal, we can always bring in Labour Relations to mediate...""

GM: ""well lets change the topic""

\*talk about getting some holiday time\*

Me: ""I also want to address the sheets""

GM: ""Okay, we all had to pitch in""

Me: ""yes, you are right. But I also want to address the fact I was cleaning the public areas. The reason I was doing that is at regular intervals I can check the desk and cameras for smokers, or unwanted guests etc. I was also cleaning toilets, was anybody else willing to clean toilets? The reason I said no to sheets is I was doing all this other stuff - which was not recognized. That is partially my fault because I did not go up to everybody 'look what I do, look what I do' while jumping up and down like a toddler so you may have not know. That is part of the reason I was upset when you declined my phone call when I attempted to talk to you about the issue like an adult. You get mad at me but nobody else did the sheets that day either and they were doing less work than me. While I don't worry usually about what other people do, but you also have to be fair.""

GM: ""so that is why the public areas looked good until later.""

Me: ""yes, I refuse to do the public areas when I got in trouble over sheets.""

GM: ""I am sorry that it had to come to this. I know if we talked, I was so mad I was going to lose it so talking about it at that time. I should have recognized or checked what you did on cameras.""

Me: ""do you know why I chose to clean toilets over folding sheets? its because it takes a set amount of time so when one thing is done, I can check the desk again. When folding sheets, I cannot come to the desk after every sheet, that would be unproductive so I do a few and next thing I know it was 15 minutes instead of 5 minutes and smokers or deliver would be waiting, or thieves would be able to get away breaking into cars. Personally, I would have rather folded sheets than clean a toilet but I found myself more productive doing the other""

GM: ""okay, all I can do is apologize and move forward. So I am sorry and I will remember to try and speak if there is an issue.""

Since then, anything over 10 minutes past the hour is given to me at 15 minutes. Morning shift is also deducted if they are more than 10 minutes late. 

\----------------------

Sorry for the overly long rant. This is my COVID story and how we dealt with the first half of 2019. I wanted to get it off my chest for a while now.

tl;dr: NA does extra work which is not recognized, told everybody has to fold sheets, when nobody folds sheets, NA gets in trouble, he maliciously complies and cars get broken into, guests get locked out for longer periods of time and delivery people wait. When he decides he will follow the schedule to the ""T"" he leaves on time and GM has to actually address the issue when he ignores her like she ignored him over the sheet incident.",14,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0B32E80>
245,"So Wrong, But So Funny: An Audit Thought On Athletic Events","(Audit thought = a shower thought, but for desk clerks)

My hotel's in Texas, so we get a *lot* of sports tournaments coming through all year. Wrestling, volleyball, basketball, baseball, tennis, cheerleading, fuckin' badminton - you name it. When we get tapped to be one of the hotels that the families can get a special rate at, they give us the full dates of the event and one thing I've always noticed is that many - most, even - of the reservations we take are not for the entire thing, meaning they totally don't expect their kids to win. Imagine that scenario playing out:

- ""Should we book for all 4 nights?""

- ""Honey...you've seen these kids play. If we're there *2* nights, it'll be by an act of God.""

It always makes me cringe a little when I encounter that, and the worst part is when the kids are standing within earshot at check-in and I confirm the dates of stay with the parents. It feels like I just added 20 hours to the kid's eventual therapy routine every time, LOL. Though, there was one time  a few years ago where the team got back from the game and I suddenly have a bunch of grumbling dads going, ""They made it to the semis, so can we extend?""

246,Naked Man Wants into the Pool Room After it is Closed,"I kid you not, this just happened, and I am typing it right after said event happened.

Me-me
NM-Naked boyo
WM-Winter Dressed boyo
OG- the other guest that accidentally walked up on this

Our pool room closes at a certain time in the night, and the doors automatically lock because of this. It's about an hour after said door has locked, and I get 2 fully grown men walking up to the front desk. One fully clothed and in all of their winter gear. The other, naked. I'm no strange to when someone comes up to the desk only in their trousers because they locked themselves out of their room getting ice or sleepwalking. However, what came next was really confusing.

Me: Hello!

NM: Uh hi. So we just tried to get into your pool, and the door wasn't working with out keycards.

Me: *originally thinking this was about getting locked out* Uh, yeah, our pool closes at (closing time) and the doors automatically lock at that time.

WM: What time is it now?

NM: Uh yeah, what time is it now?

Me: It's (1 hour after closing time.)

NM: Oh, well, is there a way you could let us in?

Me: *At this point, I'm trying to figure out why they are being so persistent about this in my head.* No. Unfortunately, the pool is going through a cleaning cycle for the night, and won't be open until morning. 

NM: Well, do you have a key you could use to let us in? 

Me: *I knew there is one, but it was past closing and as I said to them, it's gotta cycle some stuff for cleaning.* No, I don't. 

NM: Is there like a code or something you can use for us to get in? 

Me: *I was beginning to wonder if they are deaf.* No.

WM: *He looks over at NM and proceeds to point out private part.*

NM: *does the unwanted response*

Me: *I look away to the pc at this point cause this is just weird.*

WM: So anyways, is there a way you can let us in the pool room?

Me: No. 

NM: What if I broke the glass trying to get into there? *he said this was a serious tone*

Me: *I went into full shock and just remember staring because I was fairly certain he wasn't joking.*

NM: *after him and WM said some things I can't remember.* Sorry, bad joke.

OG: *Walks down and stops in the hallway to watch for a moment, then proceeds to our market area*

NM: What if I just go outside and swim in the snow? *attempts his best snowangel pose as he wobbles toward the front entrance.*

WM: Do you know what a snowangel is?

NM: *returns to front desk*

WM: That's not what a snow angel looks like.

Me: *Kinda done and just giving in to the moment* He's gonna make a beefy looking snowangel.

NM: *looks at OG* I think he needs help

Me: I quickly help OG pay for their items. NM and WM were talking, but I don't remember what they were saying because I was trying to focus on OG*

WM: Do you know of any pools that might be open right now?

Me: No. Most public pools are closed because of the weather, and most other hotels in the area close their pools the same time as we close ours.

WM: Okay

NM: Are you sure you can't open the pool for us?

Me: No, sorry.

NM and WM: *proceed to leave. I go back to my work for about 2 or 3 minutes before they return*

NM: I locked myself out of my room.

Me: Okay, what's the room number?

NM: *tells me room number and verifies some info*

NM: Okay, we're going back up to his room now.

WM: Woah, we're not sleeping together. We're not like gay or anything. He's going back to his room and I'm going back to mine with the nice view.

NM and WM: *they made some more gay jokes before leaving for the rest of the night(I hope)*

Side note, they seemed pretty much sober. I did not see or smell any alcohol, so I'm fairly certain two grown sober men just did this in front of me.

Edit: 
My coworkers updated me in them, since I guess they are pretty active group, and they were seen heavily drinking.

Also, NM returned the next night at the same time, by himself, fully clothed, and asked AGAIN if I would open the pool while holding a fresh pack of beer in his hand.",29,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0B32F40>
247,My Days Are Numbered ( Sales Manager Won.),"LITTLE UPDATE TO: [https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheFrontDesk/comments/sbfgng/i\_think\_the\_sales\_manager\_is\_sabotaging\_us/](https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheFrontDesk/comments/sbfgng/i_think_the_sales_manager_is_sabotaging_us/)

&#x200B;

I've posted here before about the Regional Sales Manager at my hotel, Ursula, and all of her antics, but this week it's coming to a head. As in, me and *the entire staff* are lining up new jobs. *Literally the entire staff is quitting.* Starting with our GM who put in her notice today.

Things were set in motion earlier this week when our GM and our hotel's sales girl got into it in an email thread (with the owner and Ursula cced). It was over the stupid shift report- a 'report' that literally is only helpful to the regional manager and owners but the sales team takes way too seriously. She made a huge deal about someone putting a ""group"" that wasn't an official group under the group tab. They're knit-picking. Trying to find ANYTHING to bitch at us about. And now she's sending us literally everything to do. She's not putting in group masters. She's not making reservations. She's not even taking calls. We're also now not allowed to book corporate rates- they have to be sent to reservations call line. Why? Because the QR booking code (that only sales uses) got leaked and randoms were using that code to get a cheaper rate. She's cut off her phone line so it doesn't ring her out-of-office phone anymore and told us not to give the actual number out. So to reach sales you have to play voicemail tag or hopes she calls you at a convenient time. Our manager called her out on all of this. So, a meeting was held with all the higher ups. 

The owner said that our *glowing* reviews (that all mention the staff members by name) were only so good because it's a new hotel, and that staff had nothing to do with it. Ursula accused us of being nothing but drama? Then accused me of stealing from the hotel- how? Well, as the night auditor everything that the AUTOMATIC night audit closeout does is under my name. Including the *BRAND* FREE NIGHT STAYS. Free as in- NO CHARGE TO THE GUEST. She pulls up 'proof' that I was giving away rooms for free. My AGM humbles her by providing the *actual* paperwork that showed where the zero charges came from. 

Ursula made a comment about her shit list, and gave the owner an ultimatum about the number 1 person on the list, our AGM. Basically either AGM is fired or Ursula walks away. And if the AGM goes, so does the entire staff. The owner and Ursula isn't smart enough to realize that. Literally every person from front to back of house is getting ready to pack up and leave. No hesitation. All for our wonderful AGM. 

With our GM quitting there's nobody to protect our AGM and she will not give them the pleasure of firing her. She will be the next to walk out. Our Head Housekeeper is already moving on. The Kitchen staff goes with the AGM. Both myself, the other night auditor, and the entire front desk staff is loyal to the AGM. As well as the kitchen manager who is the only one DHEC certified- so if she goes, so does hot breakfast. They'll have to shut down or the sales team will have to help out. They'll be nobody working soon.",40,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0B32FA0>

249,No we haven't been holding a room for your mom every saturday for 2 years,"Recently had a bizarre call on a very busy Saturday. Caller will be D for Daughter.

D: Hey I just wanted to make sure you have a room for my mother tonight? The name is Jane Smith.  

Me: I don't see anything under that name. Did you have a reservation? Because we are sold out tonight.  

D: Of course! She has a standing reservation every Saturday night. No I don't have a confirmation number, you guys just always have a room held for her.  

Me: Ok...welllll...I've worked every Saturday for the last 3 months and this is the first I'm hearing about this. Do you know when was the last time she might have stayed?  

D: Ummmm...well she got sick around March of 2020, so its probably been since then.   

Me:......sooooo....2 years ago. She hasn't stayed in 2 years. Have you been getting charged no show fees? Have you reached out to the hotel in any way shape or form to see if we're holding rooms?  

D: No, but you guys always hold a room. This is per your general manager 9name I've never heard before). I don't know who messed up, but YOU need to make sure she has a room tonight.  

Me: Ok well since the last time your mother stayed here, the hotel shut down for 9 months because of Covid/remodel, there has been a 100% turn over in staff from the top down, and even if this was a policy at some point, we would have stopped holding rooms after the 2nd or 3rd time she no showed without telling us. I am 100% sold out and you can not stay here tonight, but feel free to call back on Monday if you'd like to set something up with the current manager.  

She hung up on me at that point. I have actually checked this lady in a few times since, and she's even weirder in person.",74,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0B330A0>
250,Guy tried to fight my manager,"One day I was working the front desk at a music studio attached to a well known guitar store, let’s call it ‘stringed instrument center’. The studio primarily offers lessons but rents out the rooms for rehearsal time. 
A couple of chill regular rehearsal guys come in to try out a new young girl drummer for their band. (She was probably in her 20’s and the two regular chill guys were 40’s with dad bods.) I don’t have any reason to think they were trying to “get with “ this girl. 

Drummer girl’s jealous bf (20 scrawny 5’8”), the star of this post, is waiting in the lobby. I first noticed his presence when I hear the office phone ring (not the studios phone) from down the hall immediately followed by his agitated voice speaking to an empty lobby “isn’t someone going to answer the FKN phone?!” I wasn’t 100% sure what his deal was and no one else was in the lobby, which is often occupied by kid students, so I just went on with my paper work. I notice he takes a couple of trips back and forth between the lobby and looking through the window in the room his gf is rehearsing in. Usually preceded by “wtf is she doing in there?!” Again, talking to an empty lobby other than me but not speaking in my direction. I guess he was jealous? She eventually must’ve taped a sheet of paper over the window. I noticed he looked extremely agitated like he was a combination of constipated and on something. Bro-fight-me energy. Sure enough I see him go back in the rehearsal room and backs his girl friend up against the wall (security cams) and starts yelling at her. Out loud I say “oh shit” and bust in there to intervene and kick him out of the building. The chill guys are just standing there speechless not sure what to do. My manager, (35 6’ tall jacked up Georgia boy), heads in immediately after me also telling this scrawny POS to get out. Kid throws a 5 year olds tantrum, threatens to fight my manager, and throws a coffee table across the room. 
For a moment I thought the bf was going to swing a punch but he left followed closely by his gf. 
We all watched as they continued fighting verbally and got to their car. He threw a couple soda bottles which exploded. 
Why do girls stay with a guy like that?! It was nuts for a place that’s usually filled with chill musicians. People suck.",59,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0B33100>

Granted, I work night audit and by the time that I get in at 11pm, most guests are in already, but telling me your name is ""Bob"" doesn't help.

I could have several ""Bobs"" or ""Karens"" or ""Jennifers"".

I mean, if you want to add the first name, that's helpful. Especially if we have a lot of folks staying with us with the same surnames. (As with wedding parties.)

252,I'm Disappointed! You hear me! DISAPPOINTED!,"I currently work as an AGM at a smaller select service hotel, which means i spend alot of time at the desk. This morning i had an encounter with a guest who had an issue the previous night. An issue we *resolved*. but apparently, were supposed to compensate him for a problem we solved? and when i refused to do so this guest genuinely tried to act like he had something to 'teach' me about customer service:

*Me: Myself and I          PWJ: Patronizing Wack-Job Guest*

PWJ: Hello. Im in room 125 and i had a problem last night...

*(uncomfortable 5 second pause as i expected him to actually finish that sentence.)*

Me: OK sir, I'm not finding any guests under that room number, are you certain that was your room number?

PWJ: Well obviously i moved to another room!

Me: What was your new room number?

PWJ: 130.

*(prompt me pulling up the reservation and seeing that the reservation is not under his name, but that it was moved at 10pm last night due to A/C issues.)*

Me: I see that you had an issue with your A/C, but that we managed to resolve that by finding you a nearby alternate room.

PWJ: Well i had to move my stuff in the middle of the night all by myself!

*again. select service. 10pm, less than 30 minutes after he checked in.*

Me: I am sorry about that sir, i do know how it can be frustrating to have to move items after you've started to get settled in. Was everything in order with your new room?

PWJ: Its fine. But i think i should get some compensation for having to move my stuff in the middle of the night.

*(looking at the reservation, their paying about 20% below rack, so no.)*

Me: I'm sorry sir, but given that we resolved the issue I'm not comfortable compensating you for this issue.

PWJ: WHAT?

Me: (speaking louder so he can hear me) I'm not comfortable compensating you for an issue we resolved.

PWJ: Well I'm very disappointed that you dont understand that i should be compensated for the inconvenience, that's very poor customer service...

This guest has now called down 3 times in the past hour telling me how hes going to 'take this matter to someone else' and repeatedly getting me to spell my name to him, and him spelling it wrong.

I look forward to getting a call from corporate where they tell me that a guest has made a complaint using some butchered mis-spelling of my name. with a long list of complete lies attached of course.

I'm not sure what makes a guest think that telling me their 'disappointed' is some kind of devastating blow, because it didn't work when my mother did it, so its not gonna work now.",45,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0B331C0>
253,How to lose a tennis tournament you've already won,"I've been working in the hospitality industry for 4 years now and I can tell you that some of the worst people are those who come to stay with us for sporting events. Mainly, teens and kids, with only their coach for supervision. This story happened in late 2019, before covid, when we didn't have to remind people every other waking moment, that the masks had to stay on.

I clocked in for my shift at 11PM, glanced over at my colleague and saw it was going to be another shitshow, but alas, we only had one other night after this one, where we would be plagued by spoiled teens in a tennis tournament, causing all sorts of trouble in the hotel until the late hours of the night. The shift started off okay, the afternoon people left and then precisely at 11:30PM we're approached at the front desk about some very grave events, about ""one of you entered a girls room, shouted obscenities, slammed doors and threatened to cut off power to a few rooms.""

That's a story for another time, but basically, the afternoon FDA done goofed, coachs thought it was us and it took us some 20 minutes to explain that no, it wasn't us, it was the previous shift. To cut it short, he wasn't fired because none of the parents complained or threatened legal action against the hotel. In short, to prove it wasn't us and to figure out where exactly this happened, I had to go through our awful surveilance system and hope it didn't crash every time I tried to play footage from the last hour or so.

After clearing up that misunderstanding, I noticed one of the cameras on the 11th floor was turned to face the wall, meaning we had no view of the elevators and the door leading to the stairwell. I quickly headed up there and put the camera in its normal position. I started playing back the footage to find out who had done this (obviously knowing it was someone from the tennis people) while the coaches talked and argued loudly about whatever it is tennis coaches talk about. Not long after I find that the previous day, one of the teens holding a tennis racket, comes out of the elevator and nonchalantly walks up to the camera, puts his hand on it and turns it to the wall.

I asked the coaches to come over and have a look, and they start asking amongst themselves who is it. After a few minutes they identify the guy, and as it turns out, this guy won the tournament in his age bracket (16 - 17)!

However, due to issues in previous years and hotels refusing to host them, the people who organized the tournament only managed to secure hotel stays IF in the rules of the tournament, it was added that ""Disruptive behavior in hotel grounds hosting the participants, not limited to excessive noise, disregarding hotel norms, breaking curfew, tampering with security equipment (smoke detectors, cameras, fire alarms, etc...) would result in summary disqualification"".

The next morning, some of the tournament organizers came to have breakfast in our hotel, the guy's coach spoke with them, showed them the footage and they asked him to call that guy over and after a brief chat, he dropped to his knees and started crying in the front lobby, mentioning several times that ""This isn't fair!"" and ""I'm going to sic my mom on you!"".

If you do go stay at a hotel with your kids for a sporting tournament, or they go under their coach's or someone else's supervision, please remind them to not fuck with the security equipment in place for obvious reasons, or they might be finding the sweet taste of victory turning to bitter ash in their mouth, at the eleventh hour.",79,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0B33220>
254,Come Fly With Me,"I volunteered to come in early this morning and drive the shuttle. We have crews from two major airlines staying at our property. They are very different. Let's call one Apple and the other Unicorn. Unicorn just started staying here. Everyone on staff hates the Unicorn crews. They are demanding and rude. The Apple people are nice, on the other hand. This morning the Unicorn crew wanted to go to the airport at 4:30. We had an Apple crew going at 5:00. It takes about half an hour to make the round trip. Loaded them up and at 4:30 started to close the door when Captain said one more was coming. I explained that we had a 5:00 and needed to leave then and there. He got irate and said we can't go without the fourth attendant. I told him the attendant could take the 5:00. Nope. I said I'd give them five minutes. At 4:38 I told them they would have to wait for 5:00. The Captain started a tirade. They had been calling the attendant constantly. Finally she shows up around 4:45. She never explained or apologized. The Captain then expected me to leave. I explained that I would leave at 5. The Apple crew then showed up. There were three attendants. I also had a couple with a kid. I pulled out at 5 and most of the way the Captain bitched. I ignored him. The Apple crews are never a problem but the Unicorn Airlines crews are another story. Last week one of the Unicorn attendants claimed we had 24 hour room service and insisted someone make him a burger-at 2 AM!",21,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0B33280>
255,A tale in which a rambling drunk man does not have ID,"So I just finished checking a guy in (as in I'm literally putting cash into my drawer) when a cab pulls up and a man walks into the lobby.  He tells me that he has a debit card, and he wants a room.  He absolutely reeks of alcohol.  Oh boy.  


I ask him if he has ID, and well, of course he doesn't.  That took about a couple minutes to get across, as he seems to only hear every 3 out of every 4 words I say, and he's busy telling some incoherent story about how two cops wouldn't vouch for him at the last hotel or something?  


Anyways, I explain that I'm sorry, but I can't rent him a room without photo ID.  He just like, doesn't accept that.  Now, I would think that were I in his situation, I would leave and look for another hotel.  What he decided to do though, was lean against my window and just stare at the wall.  


The next 5-10 minutes was me trying to get across that he needed to leave.  Sometimes he'd realize that I wasn't going to rent him a room, so he asked for directions to the shelter (it is really cold now where I am so I gave him written directions in case his cab driver didn't know).  During this time, about once every minute the cabbie is honking his horn, because I'm pretty sure this guy never actually paid him.  


At various points he'd forget that I was denying him service based on hotel policy, and would say something like ""I just want a room man, look me up on the computer.""  


He didn't seem to realize that without ID, I can't verify that he is the name he gave me.  At other times within this ""conversation,"" he'd ask me to phone the police so they could like vouch for him and give him a room?  At one point he pull out a cellphone (and I'm not kidding, was utterly baffled when the time on his phone changed, as is when it went from X:29 to X:30), and said he was calling his Dad.  No, I don't know what his father was supposed to do in this situation.  This man had to be in his 40's bare minimum, so I dunno what a man in his 60's (at least) is supposed to do over the phone this early in the morning.  


Eventually I got sick of this, realized he wasn't leaving, and called the cops.  The officer had me put him on speaker, and spoke to the dude.  He basically said that I was following policy correctly, and if he had to send a car out, someone was going to jail.  If he just left now though, all would be well.  This actually seemed to get through to the guy, and he finally agreed to leave if I called him a cab.  The one waiting outside for him left as I was talking to the officer.  


At another point he seemed to be really concerned why my ""cash drawer"" was open when he was in here.  (The answer was that I open a drawer to put money in it.) The impression I got was that he though this was illegal or something and he could use it to get me in trouble?  


Now, this is when things get really weird.  And a little sad.  


In these (fucking still) COVID times we keep a pump bottle of thick hand sanitizer on the desk for guests to use.  This guy takes the bottle, screws off the pump, pulls out the little plastic tube, and sucks off the sanitizer like it's candy.  I've seen down on their luck alcoholics before but man, this seemed even worse than drinking Listerine.  This is a thick, syrupy aloe-infused alcohol hand sanitizer.  If it hadn't been like one lick, we would be in poison control territory here.  I did mention this to the officer for the record.  


As I'm on the phone with the cab company, he pulls out his phone again and pretends to call his lawyer on me, then gives his lawyer my phone number (well just the area code, which he seemed to think was the whole number), and makes a few vague legal threats.  The he pretends to call my hotel and speak with my manager.  Keep in mind I can see him, I know he didn't dial our number (or any number), nor did any of our phones ring.  


I'm mostly ignoring him at this point, but I have a small office and it's like -40c with windchill right now.  So this guy opens the door and leans against it, instead of y'know staying in the office where it's warm.  I ask him about 10 times to close the door, and that his cab is coming.  


He replies with ""No, the bus is coming"" and just up and leaves.  The cab he wanted arrived maybe a minute after he just walked off into the freezing wind.  After this was all said and done, I looked up the name he gave and sure enough he's Blacklisted from the property.  The officer called back to check in, and sure enough he's known to them too.  


I felt kinda bad for the guy, but I've already been assaulted at work before when I apparently said the wrong think to an aggressive drunk, and I'm not letting that happen again.  Besides, I think we do have a fairly decent shelter in town, one that will keep him warm while it's cold as fuck the next day or so.",17,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0B332E0>
256,“F*ck off you bony c*nts!!!”,"I work at a small-scaled hotel in a smaller town. You’d think it’d be a pretty normal place with normal guests, but NO. Something about small towns and hotels brings the crazy people around, maybe lower prices/less busy? Who knows. 

I want to start by saying this one guest clearly was not mentally stable, and I didn’t judge/call them out as I clued into that something was off. However, the situation took me by surprise. 

It was around 6am and I was almost off. I just finished setting up the breakfast room. I went back to the front desk to send the owner/manager some reports from the previous day. Out of the blue, I start hearing arguing and swearing. I thought to myself “Oh great I get to break up a fight at 6am” But it just went quiet so I thought nothing of it. Fast forward 15mins and I’m still at the front desk hearing heated conversations with swear words being thrown left and right. (The front desk is about 12ft from the breakfast room so I can hear everything) I walk in to see what’s happening but there’s only one guy sitting. I start to fill up the coffee when he starts mumbling random things sounding very irritated. I thought he was talking to me but he wasn’t even looking in my direction. So I just go on and sit back at the front desk. Within minutes, I hear an abrupt “F*UCK OFF YOU BONY C*NTS” at this point I knew something was off, he’s having conversations/arguments with himself! It only got worse after as he continually walked in and out of the front doors for an hour having these random conversations “I wouldn’t eat that it’s poison” “I’ll fight you in the parking lot fucking dick” This just continues for over an hour and I don’t approach him as I felt as if he couldn’t help it. 

Fast forward to when my manager comes in. He starts getting even more frustrated and starts throwing stuff in the breakfast room at my manager. My manager pulled out her mom voice “HEY! DO NOT pull that in my hotel” He immediately went dead quiet and went back to his room. Now he is banned because we got several complaints and we’re a family-friendly hotel. So much happened within an hour and my tired brain being awake since 11pm didn’t know how to interpret it all.

257,3rd parties... WHY?!?!?,"So I don't know if anyone else has this problem but a very specific 3rd party will send in prepaid reservations but won't update the 1 time card they send with the reservation. So when the guests come to check in it literally declines and then the guest spends the next 20 minutes yelling at me because *I must have done something wrong.* That's great you can blame me but you still have to call the 3rd party because I can do fuck all with this reservation. Last time they sent me an email confirmation because the reservation they sent didn't actually come through. The card still declined. Sorry this is a bit of a rant but this has been an ongoing issue for roughly 4 months and it's every reservation. We've had our tech team and the corporate tech support look into it to see if it is an issue on our end but they came up with nothing. My managers also refuse to stop advertising on this site ""It brings in enough money we don't have to worry about it."" It took this same 3rd party 6 months to update that we no longer allow pets.

I'm just fed up with it all.

258,I have now been dubbed...,"""Poldaran, KING OF THE RACISTS.""  It's official.  So sayeth the homeless woman.

And what dastardly deed did I commit, from here on my throne of skulls while I sip bloodwine mixed with the tears of those I have oppressed?

I, uh...wouldn't let her steal our luggage cart and then called the police when she decided to set up camp in our vestibule(the area between the outer and inner doors at the front) in protest at my tyranny?

Yeah.  So, I called  the non emergency, and after 2 minutes of trying to explain to the dispatcher what the hell a vestibule is, he assures me the cops are on the way.  All the while, I hear her - through the wall and door, as the speaker wasn't on - bitching to her big ass dog about me threatening to call the cops.

They arrive, and confirm with me that I just want her gone and trespassed, and proceed to tell her she has to leave.  And MY GOD, the rant she went on.  I'm not going to include the full thing, just highlights.

Apparently I'm part of a system that's oppressing her and her people by not...""turning the other cheek"", which ""he totally could have done"".  I mean, what the hell does she mean by ""turn the other cheek""?  Just look the other way while she walks off with our luggage cart?  Yeah, like hell am I gonna let that happen.

This continued on, for a while, as they walked her away from the building.  And then she turned.  ""That asshole in there is KING OF THE RACISTS!  You stupid assholes should be arresting him, not messing with poor <a slur for people of a certain range of skin colors that I will not be a part to repeating> who are just minding their own business!""

At least the dog never got aggressive with them and they weren't forced to shoot it.  But I wouldn't have minded if they'd tased her, not gonna lie.

&#x200B;

I'm gonna be honest.  I'm tired.  So very, very tired.  I just want to bring in all the homeless and take their kidneys.  Five or six of them disappear, and I'm pretty sure word'll get around not to come near here.

259,Did you just *tell us* you were going to commit... fraud?,"Someone else's story reminded me of this fun little story from a couple weeks back. People straight up admitting they're going to try and break rules simply because they didn't read the proper information about the hotel... It amazes me.

So, to set the scene: it's an average night. Not very busy, but just enough people that I am not the only person at the front desk. I also have my front office supervisor, Rick, popping in and out to assist me when necessary.

So, some needed context for this story: we currently only do stayover service in rooms if the guest requests it. I think this is actually a standard for our brand right now, considering everything going on. We do mention this to every guest staying more than 1 night, and we provide every guest with a welcome letter that goes over this on the front page.

Anyway. The hours have ticked by and halfway through a pretty quiet shift, I go on break, and Rick covers me. As I'm walking behind the desk to go to the bathroom, a guest approaches the front desk and says how nice our lobby is. Rick thanks him, and asks how he can help. I grab a key for the bathroom, but the guest says that I should stay and listen to what he's about to say. Kind of an awkward scenario for me, but I'm pretty easy to catch off guard, so I stay put.

Guest: So, I stay at your brand a lot. I just spent three weeks at a Suites location. Now, there, they came in and cleaned my room every day. Is there a reason my room wasn't cleaned today?

Rick: I apologize, sir, but we only do stayover service by request at this time.

Me: (staring at the guy's profile, which is the base tier on our rewards system, and that's weird, considering it only takes a week of stays to move to the second level!!!)

Guest: No one told me that!

Rick: Did you receive a welcome letter? (he holds up one of the several we have at the front desk)

Guest: Yeah, I got one of those.

Rick: Okay. So, it does explain on the front page the same information about stayover service...

Me: (my spirit is dancing on the ceiling right now as i question why ANY part of my break is being wasted on this. i am still staring at the guy's BASE TIER profile. the one you get FOR FREE. it mocks me.)

Guest: Well, I didn't read that!

Rick: That's fine, sir, and again, I apologi--

Guest: I'M JUST VERY DISAPPOINTED IN ALL THIS. I have to pay for breakfast, I have to pay for parking, and no one will come to clean my room? Is it laziness? Is that what's wrong with everyone?

Rick: Sir--

Guest: I'm not happy about this. I'm going to call my credit card company tomorrow and I'm going to dispute these charges. I'm not paying for tonight. I'm not doing it.

Me: Uh. (i know if i say anything more, i will make things much worse, but my soul will not allow me to stand there and listen to a grown, adult, taxpaying(?) man admit he would try and commit fraud against a hotel because he had to pay for his bacon and eggs at a hotel chain that doesn't advertise having free breakfast) Okay. Have fun with that.

And then, I simply left. Perhaps I am a bad coworker to leave my supervisor alone with such a silly, silly man, but I knew he could handle it. He's my supervisor, after all. Not like Rick could even offer to do anything to help the guy. He even offered to waive all charges if he wanted to find somewhere else to stay at 7pm. But, this guy was dead set a) staying at a hotel he clearly did not like but also b) not paying for the entire stay. Although, considering he admitted it, out loud, to two people, on camera, plus signed for his charges as he checked in, I don't think that was going to work out well for him.

I suppose time will tell. I have no idea how long things like that typically take because this has never happened to me before and I also haven't tried it because I am not a grown toddler.

The end. Have a good rest of your shifts, ya'll!",36,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0B33460>

261,Threaten to dispute with bank for better discounts.,"My front desk checked in a guest that has a prepaid non/refundable rate for 2 nights. 
Everything went smooth, and we even upgraded his basic room to a king. We’re a 5 stars hotel, but our bar and restaurant are closed because of covid, so our rate are super low.

Dude lied on the first night saying how the TV wasn’t working and asking for compensation or discount. so I had the engineer go up there the next morning because It was late at night. I waived the amenity fee for the first night for the inconvenience. However, when the engineer went up there, wife said the TV was working. Cool!

Then dude call the next nights again asking why there was a double charge on his bank. I explained to him that the first charge was his prepaid amount for the room and tax, and the second charge was only an authorization for the room security deposit + valet on the day that he’s checking in. He doesn’t understand what is a pending charges and threaten to dispute and call the bank because its a double charge. We went back fourth for the next 10 minutes of me trying to explain to him. Then he hung up.

The next day of checkout, he came down again and ask for a discount with my agents on my off day:

Guest: Hey, I want a better discount for my stay because my tv wasn’t working

FD: sir, we already gave you a discount on your rate for the first night and the tv issue has been resolved.

Guest: No, I want a better discount because your supervisor said he will give me a better rate because I found a better rate online. (Which I never said) 

at this point he just making shit up

FD: sir, we gave you a complimentary upgrade to a king room on the day you check in, and..

Guest: i don’t care, If you don’t give me a better discount, I will call my bank to dispute it. You can either waived my valet or something. 

He was making a scene in the lobby, so my manager stepped in at this point and wasn’t trying to argue with him and gave him a $68 discounts. 

Man, if you’re that broke don’t stay at a hotel! Our rates are already so cheap and you still want a discount.",26,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0B33520>

263,Lowest rated rated guests bring most of the trouble?,"Starting by stating the obvious, the amount of $ a guest spends at a hotel doesn’t define how reckless, entitled and costly that guest can be. Rich or less rich, there is always a dishonest ,or worst, a criminal person out there trying to not pay at all for the stay or just try to get away with anything they can. 
Coming to the point, every time we are in recovery phase of the demand after a surge, I have to leave the door opened to a higher % of opaque and generally lower rated guests. Every day looking at what happened the prior day, I see mostly these guests complaining and harassing staff to get refund on anything. The latest trend is cut your finger after you get in the room, spread it on the bed sheets and then complain to frontdesk, asking for a room change (you guessed it, a suite who solve all the issues). Smoking in the room and denying it is always a popular one. All sorts of reckless, dishonest behaviors.
When Demand is strong, low rates are closed, I have none of the crazies in-house to complain. We can focus on the real misses with real normal humans/guests. 

So… do you have similar experiences?

264,"Dumbass takes down fire detector, police is called","So this just happened, apologies for any spelling mistakes or whatnot, my hands are still shaking a bit.

This all started when I (25f) got an error alarm on my fire alarm control panel. I rushed up to the room and knocked. Someone replied something, but I couldn't make out what. Gave him about fifteen seconds to open before opening the door with my key. 

He proceeds to hold the door shut so I can't open it! Now he's saying he's undressed and I need to wait. Fine, I dont wanna see that, I wait. Finally he opens the door and the smoke detector is in his hand. He says he took it down when I said the reason I was knocking was the fire detector, to ""show me there was nothing wrong with it."" I tell him that's absolutely unacceptable, he shrugs it off and becomes irritable. I rush down to the fire panel again to shut off the alarm, since there's no fire.

The guy is around my age, tall and skinny, so not super threatening.

The next time I go up, to tell him to put the smoke detector back, he refuses to let me in, saying there's no issue with the detector. I say I need to look at it, or I will have to call security, as we can't have a malfunctioning smoke alarm as it's a risk. He yells that I should just call security then!

So I do. The security guard is let into the room and tries to put the smoke alarm back, but the alarm is still going off downstairs when I reset the panel. I call our electrician to check that it's not a system error, and he says no, it's most likely that it isn't on correctly yet. 

By then the security guard has left, so I talk with a colleague and we decide the easiest thing is to just move him to another room so I can fix the issue without him there. I give him the new keycard and tell him he has to have changed rooms in 15 minutes (after showing him the room and him agreeing to move.)

So I go up 20 minutes later (since I really don't want to run into him), and I get no response when I knock. Thinking he's finally out, I open the door. Nope, all his stuff is still there. Worse, he's snoring on the bed. 

I go back down, frustrated because how difficult is it to just move to another room??, and call the security company back. They say it's now a matter for the police, and I should call them.

Now I really don't wanna call the police over this. It's not like he's threatened my life or anything, he's just being extremely difficult and rude, so I decide to give him one last chance to move.

I knock. Nothing. So I open the door, saying ""Hello?"" loudly to wake him up. 

He is pissed. Comes charging at the door yelling to leave him alone, then rips the door out of my hand, slamming it in front of my face.

Okay, fine. I am done trying to be nice. I call the police, and wait for them in the reception with the door locked. They show up, and I tell them to kick him out, that he is not wanted here. I only go with them to open the door, then I go back down to the reception, because I am definitely not comfortable being anywhere near this guy anymore. They tell him not to come back.

Now the entrance door is locked and I deactivated his card. Really hoping he won't come back.

Also worth noting; every time I went up to speak to him alone I was on the phone with someone (my boss and then my colleague), and I was making that pretty clear. I get that they wouldn't have been able to help me through the phone if he did decide to be violent, but it does make people behave somewhatto know there's another person involved and listening. Being alone at work you don't have a lot of options.",16,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0B33640>
265,"""I AM THE CUSTOMER SO YOU HAVE TO BE NICE TO ME""","I work Night Audit at my hotel and I can't tell you the number of calls I get at 3am asking if something is available. But this call was definitely something special.

3am - Young man calls (sounds about 24 at most) and asks if we have any availability. It is currently President's Day Weekend and we are booked solid. My daily totals are actually at -4 (we are over sold).

I apologize saying ""so sorry, we are actually  completely sold out for tonight""
The lovely would-be guest responds angrily, about half of the words out of his mouth are curse words, and basically says that it's impossible for EVERY SINGLE ROOM to be filled.
Maybe I came off a little irked, but I thought I answered nice enough saying that ""actually  every room is filled right now""
He proceeded to call me every name in the book saying he just needs a room and that he is the customer so I have to be nice to him.
Sooooooooo
I nicely recommended  2 other hotels in the area and told him to have a nice day. All while he was still spurting off more curses towards me.

266,This is becoming a thing,"""I can show you my vax card...""

Bear with me, dear friends, for this will not be an epic tale, nor will it likely entertain much, but it has happened three times, and I feel the need to complain.  What follows is an amalgamation of three separate conversations I've had in the last few weeks.  G will be our guest, Patrick Starr\*.  ""Eduardo, Man of Love"" will be me.

G: Hello, I need a key to my room.

Eduardo, Man of Love: Ah, yes, I can do that for you.  I just need to see a photo ID.

G: I left that in the room(/car/at home).  But I have my vax card.

Eduardo, Man of Love:  Does that have your photo on it as placed by the entity that issued it?

G: No.  But it's an official document.

Eduardo, Man of Love:  Okay, fair enough.  But bear with me now.  A photo ID is necessary because without a photo, anyone could use it if you lost it.

G: Uh huh.

Eduardo, Man of Love:  And a vax card doesn't have a photo on it.

G: Sounds logical.

Eduardo, Man of Love:  So I can't use a vax card as a valid form of PHOTO ID.

G: Makes sense to me.

Eduardo, Man of Love:  Okay, so do you have any kind of photo ID?

G: I can show you my vax card.

Eduardo, Man of Hate(Internal Monologue):  I swear upon all that is holy, I will cut open your guts with that pen right there.  Then I will pull out your intestines and hook them to a car battery.  And more than all that, I will keep you awake and make you watch as I do it.  ""I can show you my vax card!""  Did your mother drink to excess while pregnant?  Did some keg stands while simultaneously smoking and snorting\*\* crystal meth?  Or did you do this brain damage to yourself?

&#x200B;

Anyway, so how has your week been going?  :P

268,"You Can’t Evict Me, My Uncle is a Sergeant","Hello All,

Back to the Legal Garden we go, and only a week after my first tale (the one with the only serious threat of harm).

Once again I’m working night audit.  All is calm at first.  That is until I get a call about a party going on.

Goddamnit, not again.

I head up to the room in question and knock.

-No answer

I knock again

-Still no answer, but I do hear those inside trying to hush the other guests.

We are now at the point that I don’t give second chances.

I knock again.  This time a guest does answer, and I inform them that they will need to leave the property.

They try to play dumb, and I explain the situation.  They refuse to leave, and I inform them that I will call the police if they don’t vacate the property.

One of the partiers scoffs and says I can’t do that as his uncle is a sergeant with the local police.

I give one final warning, and after being told off again, I call the police.

The police arrive, and while that is enough for most parties to disperse, these idiots decided to press their luck.

Some disperse, but others also tell off the cops.  The officers even sent another officer back down by the cars to make sure these idiots didn’t try anything.

The guest who said his uncle was a sergeant made the same claim to the officers.  Obviously, the officers don’t care.  Not only that, but the guest proceeds to call his uncle trying to get him to order the officers to stand down.  He even tries to hand his phone to the officers which elicits a “Hi Serge.  No he’s getting evicted from a hotel.  I think you can see why.”

The guest was dumbfounded that the call didn’t work.

By now the police are also done playing games, and after a threat of being brought downtown, the party finally leaves.",46,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0B337C0>
269,A Karen is Near,"Okay, so tonight I'm working evening shift (3-11) and it's been pretty chill. A few check ins, one of them being a family, but everything went smoothly so I'm relaxing in the break room. I ran out of water so I went to go fill up my cup with ice, and our water just so happens to be in the lobby. The family I mentioned previously was in there playing cards. Not a big deal. They're being decently quiet and not causing a ruckus. 

Except when I went to pour my water, a nearby Karen in the family full on GLARED at me. At first I thought it was my anxiety. I tend to think people are staring and judging quite a bit. But this wasn't my anxiety. I had the nerve to glance at her and she's looking at me, eyes narrowed and lips pursed like she's about to tell me off. I ask politely if they need anything. I'm hard of hearing and was wearing an earphone in one ear so I could have missed something. 

One of them, an older guy, just joked that I could play cards with them. I laughed it off and the conversation ended, but the woman just kept GLARING.

270,A rare sighting: a guest apologized,"I was going to write a post earlier when a guest pissed me off, but she actually just came down to apologize. 

We've been one per shift for a long time now, and I was a bit busy earlier tonight because we don't have a Houseman on tonight. During a lull, I thought I would be safe to go to the bathroom and then bring some towels down from Housekeeping to fold. I was gone for maybe 5 minutes, 7 tops, and when I got back to the desk the phone was ringing and someone was waiting to get in the building. We have an issue with homeless people being in the downtown area but I won't get into that, so because of it, we keep our doors locked 24/7. We used to lock them at 7pm in the winter and 9 in the summer, but we decided that it was worth it to keep them locked all the time. It gets tedious having to open them for the people that don't read the sign (DOORS ARE LOCKED, PLEASE USE KEY CARD OR BUZZ FOR ASSISTANCE), but it's better than homeless people hanging around the lobby. 

I open the door and she storms in, fury in her eyes and practically yells ""I've been out there for a very long time!! I thought you lock your doors at 7?"" For reference, she checked in at 6:45. I apologized and explained that we keep the doors locked at all times now. I also explained that I'm the only one here and was upstairs doing other tasks, and that I was sorry for making her wait. I did the check in, asking all the necessary questions (confirming number of nights, asking if she was using the card on file), and her answers were always short ""yep""s, and she was on her way. I decided to cool off before posting anything, and continued with my towels. 

A couple hours later, she walked down the stairs in front of the desk. She said she wanted to apologize for the way she spoke to me, and that she was a bit cranky but she knows she shouldn't have taken it out on me. She said ""I know you're just doing your job the best you can"", and that it had been bothering her so she apologized. 

I have 4 shifts left before I leave for my new job. I honestly didn't think I would get any more tales, and at least this one had a happy ending.",24,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0B33880>
271,A Most Memorable Experience,"Hey all!

 First off, thank you for what you all do and I can't thank my lucky stars enough that this is an old tale that I was reminded of by a friend and wanted to share (I'm in restaurants now so more of a lateral move, but my hotel stories stick in my mind like glue).



To set the scene, it is the year 2016 and we are in a modest (read: absolute trash) two star hotel off of a highway. The hotel rhymes with Watergate-well, it starts with a W and ends in gate, anyway. It has 84 rooms, a mix of local and business guests, and plenty of crazy for everyone. The hotel was built in the 70s, we're about to go through renovations in a month, and I am the lowly weekend NA.


It's a normal Sunday night/Monday morning, not super full but not empty by any means, and it's around 3 am. I checked in the last reservation about an hour ago into room 111. After that no more reservations. I'm about to start audit and I'm excited that the next four hours will go by fast and I can get off work without having any major pass along notes (oh how wrong I was).


Then I get The Call. It's room 111,  and they're complaining about the carpet being wet. I figure it's a water leak. The weird thing is, if it's a water leak it's gotta be coming through the wall, not a ceiling leak as was to be expected at this property. I immediately offer them a move, they gratefully accept, and I am  left to puzzle out where this water is coming from.


Now a curious thing about this property is that, due to it's age and it's lack of proper upkeep, a leak from a pipe the floor above is a very normal thing. Normal to the point where we had 5 rooms permanently OOO due to water leakage. And, again, we're renovating in a month so it's not like there's an issue if I put another room out of order for the same problems that others are having. However I want to do my due diligence and see if I can find the source of the leak.


Checking in room 111 I can see that the carpet is waterlogged and squishy, starting from the wall directly connected to the next room, and beads of water welling up near the base of the wall. Water is oozing into the carpet from the wall. Weird, and not par for the course as far as I could tell. Clearly there's a problem in the adjoining room, and so I leave 111 and head into 113 next door. 


As soon as I step into the room it's pandemonium. There's an inch of water floating on top of the carpet, the tile, everywhere imaginable in the room. It's like a frog redesigned the place for it's own utmost comfort. Shocked and now dealing with a situation entirely outside of my pay grade, I continue into the room. The water is coming from a giant crack in the ceiling right above the bathtub-ironically the location is not keeping the mess contained. Placing the biggest trashcan in the room directly under the largest stream of gushing water, I speed out of the room and manually shut the water off in the hotel, knowing that regardless of the dire state the whole place is in I will get a serious write up if I don't miraculously fix this. However it is now 4am and I am going to have people bitching up a storm if they can't shower in about 2 hours, so I do the unthinkable: I call my GM.


In an astounding act of god he actually picks up, and during the roughly 30 second phone call consisting mostly of half asleep grunts on his end, and panicked explanations on mine, he tells me to 'turn the water back on and deal with the fallout.' I knew this was a doomed endeavor. Looking back, I wish that I had been a more wizened and pessimistic creature but at the time I was young and naive, and wanted to fix problems that I should not. So I grabbed a shop vac, the giant kitchen trashcan and went back to room 113. 


I replace the tiny room can that was under the leak with the industrial sized garbage can, leave the shop vac just inside the door and go back to the water main to turn it on. The water main is outside, so I don't notice anything wrong at first. Honestly I was probably gone for 5 minutes or so, I took a smoke break on the way because I was being paid $8 an hour and the smoke breaks saved my butt. However by the time I got back to 113 I desperately wished that I had full sprinted back to the room.


The bathroom ceiling is on the floor.


 And in the shower. And in the sink. And...everywhere. In the short amount of time I have been gone, the renewed pressure from the pipes above the shower has had a cataclysmic effect on the durability of our infrastructure. Water is now pouring where it was streaming, there is no longer any divide between exposed piping and serviceable hotel bathroom, and I am about to have a panic attack. It is now 5:35, an hour and twenty five minutes until it is not my problem. I breathe deeply and roll up the sleeves on my cheap Bal-mart button up shirt. And I grab the shop vac.


It took me until 6:51 to clean up the shattered pieces of the ceiling. I dumped the trashcan filled with burst-pipe water twice in the meantime into the storm drain outside. When I left that morning, the trashcan was approximately 1/4 full and the GM would be there at 9. Apparently the main still had to be shut down for most of the day. 


 I never got any flack about how I handled the situation but I learned after the fact that the GM got his ass chewed out because we ""can't limit our already limited rooms when we're about to lose revenue over the renovation."" Said hotel lasted about a year after the renovations before shutting down permanently(can't imagine why). 


While I don't miss that hotel in the least I do miss certain aspects of the job and hope all of you who have been working amidst and through this pandemic have at least gotten some unbelievable stories out of it! Much love to past, present and future front desk workers.",7,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0B338E0>
272,"On my first night shift, I got ripped off by crackheads","Greetings! First language is French, apologies for any spelling/grammar mistakes and the long incoming read. All is not directly to the situation, but it gives context.

This story happened to me 2-3 years ago so some details are kind of blurry as of today. As I wondered what I was going to do with my life, I started working at an hotel because I liked customer service and also meeting all kinds of different people. I usually did the shift from 15pm to 23pm from Tuesday to Saturday.

The hotel is in a somewhat sketchy neighborhood in one of Canada's biggest cities.  But it is still a 4 star hotel and has decent prices, so we usually didn't have weird customers or anything related to drug users/organized crime. The hotel is right beside a highway so the usual customers were mostly business visitors that wanted something sort of classy and fairly close to industries.  I'm really enjoying the job as client are pretty much always happy when checking in.

Then, the pandemic hits. I'm sure I'm not making you guys learn something new, but we did loose more than 99% of all the future bookings we had and with a lot of businesses being shutdown, things weren't going back to normal anytime soon. I went from having around 20 check-in a night to 1 or 2. At that point, we had to lower prices to try to be more competitive for ""locals"".  The clients than started being one of two things, long term stayers or criminals (or at least related to illegal activities).

The hotel administrative staff and managers were mostly a big Italian a family.  Due to the pandemic, more and more employees were let go. I remained employed because I was good at my job and also I was paid way less than the other full time front desk employee (she had a different position before and kept her salary). As time continued, more and more employee left, and we had no more security and no more night shift house keepers. We had a reliable employee coming in for 2 night audits a week but the remaining 5 were given to a newly arrived immigrant who was let go after a couple of weeks due to his difficulties to adapt and even speak English.

The Italian family asked me before if I would be up to do a night shift once a week to help things out. Initially, I declined because I had absolutely no interests in destroying my sleep schedule and also I had heard from previous employees that when you start to give the managers something, they really go all out to exploit it. After working there for a couple of months, I learned that there were 2 types of employees : the family and the not family. However after a while, I accepted to lend a hand because I'm a good guy, and I heard that these shifts were very calm and uneventful.

So during the day before my night shift, I am not doing anything unusual as I am expecting a quiet and peaceful evening at work reading mangas and browsing reddit. Being a stoner, especially during these years, I had the brilliant idea to smoke a bit before clocking in at 11pm (I had never smoked before work in my life and never did after, DON'T DO IT).  It was a Saturday.

So I clock-in and during the evening, I got quite busy, waaaaaaaaaay more than my high self expected to say the least. My shift starts and a couple of the regulars go out of their rooms and come chat a lil bit with me (all workers or long-term stayers). At the time, I was also the only employee present at the hotel and my only resource was to call one of the higher ups of the Italian family who had a room in the Hotel but wasn't there that night. As the night gets close to 1AM, the phone starts ringing asking if rooms are available for the night and I start getting some walk-ins. I ended up doing around 6-7 checks in which is 3 or 4 times more what I would do on my regular shift at the time. I was also on a mild high and wasn't as efficient as usual, so I was focusing pretty hard on not making any mistakes during the process. I was naïve at the time, but now looking back I realize most of these people (probably all of them)  were either drug users, gang members or prostitutions enthusiasts. At that point, I'm really stressed as I am way more busy than I had anticipated and I'm also feeling like an idiot for smoking before the shift (seriously never do that).

Around 3 or 4 in the morning, a couple walks down the elevator. I had seen them come in before as they joined one guest in his room. I did not know this guest and did not know for certain if the couple were clients. They asked me to check out and give me a room number with a key. The room has indeed one guest in it and I don't know the name. There was only 1 key, but that was a continuous issue at the hotel and I really didn't question it. As I look at them, I noticed that they both have dilated pupils as they are talking to me which makes me feel incredibly uncomfortable.  My high is definitely starting to crash, but I'm now sleep deprived operating on caffeine which makes me even more nervous and my mind is still blurry. Reminder that at the moment that I'm the only employee in the hotel, so I can't really go inspect the room and I for sure don't want to leave these 2 people alone at the front desk. My only resource is away doing god knows what on a Saturday night. At that moment, I should have started to ask questions to the couple, but I don't want these weird drugged people to get frustrated at my questions and react unexpectedly. I'm also not at my best mental capacity and the problem solving section in my brain is too busy panicking at me being with 2 hard drugs users. Before, I've let some people leave without room inspections due to being the only employee, albeit not in a night shift.  So I give them back the cash deposit that was made for the room and let them go, hoping nothing would happened before the end of my shift.  Brilliant idea, I know.

10 - 15 minutes later, around 4:15 AM the front desk's phone starts to ring, I look at the display, and you guessed it, it's the room that just checked out!  At that moment, I wanted to crawl into the ground and reincarnate as a happy puppy. That did not happen, so I answer the call not really knowing what to expect. The client is obviously angry and the first thing he mentions was how could I let these people check out?!?! I apologize, tell him to not worry about it and that my manager would fix things up with him in the morning.  Despite being unsatisfied and angry, the client hung up and I didn't hear from him until the end of my shift. The end of my shift is now near and I'm stressed out over my mistake, and I'm basically praying that the guest doesn't come down.

The sales manager than comes in around 6:15 and I tell him I screwed up big time. This manager was the only one not part of the family and was by far the most professional person there.  He explains to me that this is now an outside matter and starts to explain what is happening/will happen. At that point, I'm clearly not high anymore but I am barely functioning after stressing all night due to my mistake and smoking before my shift, so I listen without registering anything and leave.

Walking back home, I realized that I have been scammed and start to wonder how the room occupant KNEW INSTANTLY what I had done. I left hotel work a couple of weeks after.

&#x200B;

TL,DR : I went into my first night shift high and got ripped off by crackheads who pretended to have a room and I let them check out.",14,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0B33940>
273,Interesting start for the night,"This job has desensitized to me many situations and the type of people I deal with, but last night threw me for a loop.

 I came to work last night to start my NA shift and needed to change into uniform, but as i stepped into one of the restrooms near our restaurant I noticed that the trashcan had been pulled close to the toilet. Seeing that, I immediately had a bad feeling about it and noped out of there to the restroom next door. Lo and behold as I walk into the bathroom I am greeted by the same sight. I stand there for a second, giving it some thought and step forward, thinking maybe housekeeping took the time to clean the trash cans today and just didn't put them back.

Boy was I wrong. It turns out some guest(s) or outsider(s), in some ritualistic manner pulled the trash cans close to the toilets and proceed to urinate inside and all over the trash cans....in both bathrooms...Now I've walked into our bathrooms and seen literal shit everywhere, but this one feels so deliberate it feels somewhat alien. Fortunately one of the trashcans had paper towels in it so there's not too much of mess in that one. I end up having to change near our fitness center and just say nothing to the departing PM team as they're the talkative/gossip type and just print out of order signs to place on the doors and write it down for my morning pass a long.

My heart goes out to the lovely people of housekeeping who put up with the messes we just can't handle. Give your housekeepers a hug!



Edit: the housekeeper who ended up cleaning the mess told me at the end of my shift that it was actually extremely watery vomit. So actually worse than pee. Don't question me on if I smelled it to even assume it was pee. I was holding my breath the entire time i approached the trashcans.",19,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0B339A0>
274,Nasty lockers,"Hey all. First post here. Not much of a tale but more of a quick laugh for you all. Specially the ones doing that overnight just like me. 

Here we go. 

I work part time at a hostel in NYC and we have rental lockers so that our guests can leave they luggage before they check in or after they check out. To get to the locker room, you need a password for a keypad on the door. 

Anyways, every night we have to change the code to that room and during the day, the other two shifts give the new code to our guests as they check in/out. 

Last night I noticed that we had a very busy day for a Sunday so I knew there would be a lot of requests to store luggage. 

I’m 30+ but can’t resist. Last night I made the nasty clerks give code 6969 to our guests. I often have it set as 8008, 0420 etc.

Hope you all enjoy your days!

275,The Parasites in room 315,"I can't fucking take it anymore, I genuinely feel so frustrated that it feels like i'm going to cry honestly. In the beginning of January a mother & daughter both checked into room 315 (obviously thats not actually their room) & at first they were ""normal"". The mom said her daughter was mentally ill so she requested their market tab be permanently closed, ok.. didn't have to go into detail but w/e. They were originally supposed to only stay for 2 weeks. However as the days went by we started realizing their item requests started getting larger & more weird. Who needs 5 bathmats & 4 tissue boxes  every day sent to their room?

It's pretty obvious they are stealing them. They have even gotten bold enough to ask us to place the items in garbage bags which we conveniently see them walk out w/ every day. When finally started limiting their supplies they started repeatedly reporting us to our consumer affairs. They just blatantly lie about their items not being sent up & try to gaslight all of us at the FD by denying having requested something from someones previous shift (we have since started an extensive list confirming w/ housekeeping the items that they receive daily). It's driving us all insane

I don't understand why my GM hasn't kicked them out already, they have caused numerous noise complaints bc they both scream at each other constantly (then call down requesting a new room reservation for the daughter only for her to an hour later cancel it, then complain about our cancellation fee). They steal our shit, & have just gotten progressively weirder as time went on. The mother keeps bringing in these massive birthday balloons that her daughter (who is most likely in her early 30s..) screams at her for, the mom also now just walks around the hotel lobby in a large shirt shirt, no bra or pants on underneath & she will just walk around the hotel wearing only that & slippers & whilst picking her nose and wiping her disgusting ass boogers on furniture in our business center I shit you not.

I also have started a daily tally of how many times they call us a night (their highscore being 18!). They are literally human parasites feeding off the hotel, the longer they stay the more insane they get. I picture them as one of the monsters from the netflix show Sweet Home tbh.

**EDIT: ITS THE NEXT DAY & MY GM JUST TOLD ME THEY CALLED CORPORATE TO TRY TO GET ME FIRED LMAOOOO (we literally only have 3 FD employees (besides night audit), they would not function w/o me)**

276,"Lie to a new member of staff? Believe it or not, jail. I mean DNR.","DNR- Do Not Rent for you non hotel working lurkers.

Long time readers may remember that we had a drunkard night auditor. Fortunately I get to use the past tense regarding his employment here because he finally screwed the pooch so hard the boss had no choice but to fire him. He lives on property and stumbled drunk to his room at 4am one night and passed out, leaving the desk completely unattended. Quite a surprise for me when I came in at 8. Had to do audit for him and then some detective work to piece together what happened. 

Anyway, on to the story I actually meant to tell.

We hired a very sweet girl to replace him. She has prior hotel experience though at a more upscale place so she's a little unfamiliar with how things are done at economy properties like ours. Last week she gave someone a 3pm c/o for free. She'd either forgotten or never been told that the latest we allow for free is 12. It wasn't a big deal.

This morning I came in and she tells me this guy checked in and told her that he always gets a 3pm c/o, he has an arrangement with management. She told him she wasn't allowed to offer anything past 12 and that he'd have to confirm that arrangement in the morning with her supervisor (me). I told her he was probably full of shit, I didn't know anything about any arrangement but I'd look into it.

I recognized the name, and know that he stays somewhat regularly. But when I checked his past reservations I didn't see any notes or any indications that he'd ever been allowed to check out that late so I left his c/o at 12.

I mentioned what happened to my longtime coworker who was recently promoted to GM (and is doing a fantastic job, should she happen to read this. And I do mean that). She scrunched up her face when she saw who it was and told me to put him on the DNR because she already didn't like him.

277,Guest Looks for FD Agent in Bathroom,"I mean title says it all. We have a group of travel nurses that have been here the past 3 months and I never encountered such rude people in my life. I mean I have but the consistency of which these horrid nurses treat us at the front desk so ill mannered is just starting to become unbearable. Don't get me wrong I respect their role significantly in our community especially during times like these but that doesn't give them the right to talk to anyone any kind of way.

It's 7:20am when I go to the use the restroom after having severe cramps the day prior and this morning. I'm the only one at the front desk. One of the nurses (known by our team to be flat out rude like a few other of her colleagues) decides to go to the back office (as told to me by one of the housekeepers), then goes into the bathroom  and yells ""Hello!? I Need a new key!!"" As I am washing my hands, I go to briefly fix my hair in the mirror without saying a word and she keeps the door propped open saying ""I can't get into my room I need a new key"". I don't say anything. Just walked to the front desk and made her keys. How disrespectful and humiliating. I've completely lost my patience with this group and that was the last time I'm tolerating that behavior.",97,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0B33B20>
278,Your car went for a drive without you.,"The King's Feet was a 62 room motel on a large property. It had multiple parking lots, one of which was beside a pond/brook. 

On one of my night audit shifts, in walks a young Aussie by himself, after making a last minute Sux-Speedia reservation. He's got the passport and c/c to match. Beautiful! I decide to upgrade him from a 1 bed to a 2 bed suite, just because I'm in the mood. I’m having a good night so far, so why not? He seems happy, and off he heads to his room. 

My shift appears to be going great, but about 1am (while keeping an eye on the security cameras), I notice a vehicle start to back out of a parking space with only it's day time running lights on. It's backing out of what the staff call the Pond Side parking lot.

I'm not paying a whole lot attention until I realize that the vehicle is still backing out in a straight line instead of backing out at an angle. A straight line leads to nowhere but the pond. With growing concern I watch as the car gets close to the edge of the paved parking lot, then I start to hit panic mode as I see the car slowly dip over the edge and roll backwards into the water. 

Trying not to freak out too much, I try to reason out whose car just went into the water. I decide to start with the wing that has their room windows facing the pond, figuring most guests like to see their vehicle from their room. 

Off I go down the hallway. I only hear noise from one room, and you darn well bet it’s from Mr. Aussie Upgrade’s room. I knock on the door and when he opens it, surprise, there are 3 more guys in the room. I ask “any of you guys drive a little dark 4 door standard shift car?”. One guy pipes up and says he does. I then ask, “Did you park it by the pond ?”. He says yes. I then break the news to him. “I’m pretty sure your car just rolled backwards into the pond, you might want to go check.”.

Sure enough, it was his. He had to call a tow truck, poor guy.",26,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0B33B80>
279,"Well, if the first four hotels say the same thing, surely the fifth will say something different!","Hi, I'm new!

Anyway, had a guy call up the last few days. He's been fairly decent, to the point. He's going to be in town later this week, specifically Monday, and wants to know if he can get an early check in.

We have 120 rooms, and currently have sold 89 of them. There are 72 departures in the morning. 

So, I tell him that early check in is on an as-available basis, and I can not guarantee anything being available before 3 PM.

He starts to get annoyed, and complains that I'm the fifth hotel to tell him that, and starts arguing about various ""what-if"" scenarios, then hangs up.

280,Thanks for the honesty,"It was 6 am and I was one hour away from finishing an 11 hour shift. I had finally caught up on all my tasks and was looking forward to a last 1 hour relaxing end to my shift.

Nope.

I hear a “boom, boom, boom” of bass. An older blue hatchback car pulls up to the front door. Out exits who I can only describe as a French lumberjack (checkered jacket, brawny build with a full beard). He enters the lobby and starts the convo this way; “I’m here to visit my sick granny, but I have to let you know I’m from California and am a member of a Mexican/American drug cartel.”. 

I am already over this encounter (just the latest of a full moon 2 day wtf?), so I say as calmly as possible. “Sounds good. I just need a valid picture ID and credit card. Check out is still at 11am this morning, but before we go any further, can you head back out to your vehicle and turn down the music, please. Guests are sleeping.” 

God bless him, he gets the hint and says “I might be back, it doesn’t matter what the room price is, I can afford it.” 

Yeah, we gonna be sold out just in case, once I leave a little incident report in the log book.  Bye, bye, now. All the best to his Grannie, though.",13,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0B33C40>
281,The 2 For 1 Special,"I could NOT wait to write this story for you all to read. I'm still cackling about it with my co workers. 

Tonight, we are almost sold out with two rooms left. However, we still have a number of reservations as i95 south is busy with construction and just busy in general. I go to check in a guest reserved for an empty room. The guest goes up to the room and comes back down because their keys aren't working. I redo the keys and send them back up after apologizing for the inconvenience. No big deal, right? Wrong. I hear the elevator and see them come back down. Now they are pissed and I can feel my heart in my stomach. Someone REALLY is ALREADY in the room. But how?

Everybody is confused. Me, my co worker, the laundry girl and the maintenance guy. I call the room in a panic and nobody answers. So I send the maintenance guy to check the room out. He can't get in because the dead bolt lock is on. Again, I call the room and still no answer. In the meantime, I tell my co worker to move the other guest to the only suite we have left and give them bonus points. 

The other guest just came down to ""complain"". She lied and said my co worker (who checked her in last night) was supposed to put her in for two nights. However, when your keys didn't work for you to get back in the room, you never came to the front desk to see why. And apparently she had a family member stay in the room to open the door for them. Then she asked for her receipt. I politely gave her the receipt from LAST NIGHT and her receipt from TODAY. Especially now that's she claiming ""we're checking out early so why are you charging us a full day!?!"" We go back and fourth with each other for 5 minutes. And she's loudly cursing in front of the other guest waiting to check in. But I was not budging; I will not be intimidated tonight. She finally gives up, snatches the receipts out my hand and walks away slamming face first into our automatic doors. 

when I tell you, it took everything in me to not bust out laughing. she turns around and flips me the bird before her husband had to drag her out. all I can say is Karma. Ma'am you tired to stay a second night without paying and somehow some way it backfired on you. 

I'm feeling really good right now off of this Karma-isc high. lol",15,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0B33CA0>
282,I have sympathy for the hotels that regularly get hockey groups,"My hotel got a hockey group that came this past week. They check out tomorrow and Monday and I feel for the hotels that get them regularly. First I don’t know why they decided to book with us. My hotel is located inside an airport terminal. First they booked mostly doubles. We have about 100 doubles, and the rest of the 400 rooms are either kings or suites. We do not have free breakfast, and we do not have free parking. The parents are all bitching about the parking fees, which they’re getting for half price. The rooms are normally $400 a night, but they’re getting them for $150/night with a mandatory 4 night stay. The night they all checked in we had a blizzard come through and so many people were pissed we could only offer kings. We’ll likely get nailed on the reviews when they come in next week. They also pull their cars multiple times from valet to the point we had more pulls from valet than we had rooms. These assholes don’t tip either. The valet drivers are losing a ton of money over this. The group is also getting half price valet. 

My GM hasn’t gotten the heat yet, but when those reviews come in they will. They also bitch about having to pay for Wi-Fi, but if they’re a loyalty program member they can get it for free. They refuse to sign up for the loyalty program. They’re also pissed they can’t get outside food delivered to their room. They have to go to valet and pick it up. The main reason is because it’s an airport and cars can’t be left outside for anymore than just a few minutes. 

This is the first time we’ve had one of these groups and I doubt they’ll be welcomed back.",98,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0B33D00>
283,Think I'm going to break some rules tomorrow.,"I've already told the handful of housekeepers and front desk to be ready for burgers, dogs, chicken and beers tomorrow. Once I punch out I'm going to crack open a beer, grill up some food on the hotel grills and then sneak my family in to swim in the pool. I told housekeeping to join me. We're also going to eat by the pool. I'm going to be breaking at least 4 rules. Add in condiments, napkins, towels, use of carts, and keeping my work key handy, that's probably closer to 8 broken rules.

Hehe I'm such a troublemaker. But hey, it's the off season, the big bosses aren't there and the staff deserve a little treat.",12,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0B33D60>
284,Shortest interaction with an upset guest,"So this guy walks in and says he has a Reservation under ""Jack Smith,"" so I look it up, nothin. I tell him, ""Sorry sir, it looks like we don't have a ""Jack Smith"" tonight, could it be under a different name? He says, ""No, Your app did the same thing to me last night."" I apologize for the reservation not being in my system, and ask for a confirmation number. He snaps back, ""Well if your app didn't make the reservation then I don't have a confirmation number!"" I reply, ""I mean, it's not my app, so... I'll need an I.D. and credit card you reserve-""

The guy looks at me as if his eyes said, ""This bitch"" and actually says, ""You know what? Fuck You.” and leaves. I pause and say ""okay, bye. Have a nice day,"" he sarcastically replies the same and takes off. This encounter took all of I min. 30 sec. tops.

285,Last week on the desk. Of course I have to deal with a D-Bag guest first thing.,"***UPDATE ADDED***

I just posted yesterday how I handed in my resignation as I am moving on to a better opportunity. So I'm not that surprised that the universe has decided to send me a total d-bag of a guest first thing in the morning. 

Last night a family of four checked in. Mom, Dad and 2 teenage boys. I didn't see any of them until this morning when I got in for the AM shift. I see the Dad and lo and behold, no mask. (Restrictions are still currently in place and masks are still required to be in the hotel in our public areas) 

For this story I will be ME (duh)
D will be Dad or D-bag (honestly both are fitting)
M will be Mom

ME: Excise me sir, do you have your mask?

D: It's in my room

ME: ok sir, but just a reminder you need to have it on once you exit your room and can remove it once you are outside as they are required on all our public areas 

D: whatever ( mumbles as he walks away)

I knew things were going to get worse after seeing his shameless response. But thankfully I didn't hear anything for about an hour and a half or so. Then I see him coming in again, (he must have slipped past me at some point) once again without a mask. I step out from the desk and put my hand up for him to stop.

ME: sir I have already asked you, you can't come in without a mask on. 

D: (while holding a mask in his hand tries pushing me out of the way to get past) IVE GOT ONE

ME: ok but you clearly aren't wearing it and now you have shown you have no interest in following the rules of the hotel so I will have to ask you to go up to your room and collect your thing because you are no longer welcome here. (This is where Mom finally chimes in)

M: well, just wait. Why do we have to leave? 

ME: because I have asked him multiple times to wear his mask and he refuses to comply.  (D-Bag rounds the corner)

D: Ya know, why are you making this a big deal?

ME: I have to take our rules seriously as well as the health and well being of our other guests. You just have to wear your mask, it's really simple.

D: Well I think you are a simpleton and you can screw off.

ME: you now have 30 minutes to vacate the property or I call the police to have them escort you off. We don't tolerate our staff being insulted. 


5 minutes later the Mom comes down asking why she had to leave since it was her booking. I told her if her and the boys wanted to stay that was fine as they had been wearing their masks and following the rules and being respectful but he had to go. She said ok and went back to the room. 

30 minutes later they came down all dressed in fancy clothes like they were going to a wedding with NOT A SINGLE PIECE OF LUGGAGE!!! I was in shock, I know they are going to try to come back when I'm not here and sneak their way back in. I have left notes everywhere, locked their keys out so they are forced to come to the desk to get them working again, taken screenshots of him off our security camera. I regret not calling the police immediately. I had to laugh to myself when she asked to speak to my manager, I happily handed her his card because what's he gonna do.... Fire me!!! HA! 

Any advice on how to handle this when they come back would be helpful. I won't be here when the next shift will have to deal with this.


***UPDATE***

I got into work this afternoon and got pulled into my managers office almost immediately to ask for my side of the story as the proverbial shit had hit the fan.

Apparently, not only did D-Bag come back but he tried fighting multiple staff members and other guests. Around 11pm he came to the desk after not being able to get the keys to work on their room, threw his keys at our PM shift supervisor and starts screaming about unfair treatment. The supervisor informed him that he knew who he was and would not allow him back in the room and he had 30 seconds to leave the property before we called the police. 
Well.... He didn't like that and tried taking a swing at the supervisor over the desk. One of his teenage sons tried grabbing him and pulling him back and apologizing but it was too late, the PM Supervisor was already calling the cops. Even knowing the cops were getting called he still kept going. Our night security came out and grabbed him to drag him out but D-Bag regained his footing and tried squaring up with him.
 Our security guy isn't huge but isn't small either, still it was a blessing when a few guys that were staying with us had rounded a corner to head out for the night saw what was happened and lent a helping hand in dragging the guy out kicking and screaming. The cops arrived a few short minutes later and arrested him. Mom and the boys then begged our PM Supervisor to let the three of them stay because they had been trying to help us. And they had no where to go. I wouldn't have but he has a bigger heart than I so he let them. They checked out this morning without incident but then my GM gets an email from the Mom saying that she wants a refund for the entire stay because they were all kicked out on the first day of their stay and didn't even get to stay even one night (I legitimately laughed out loud) that's why I was pulled into the office right away. I showed him the security footage I had saved that clearly shows the whole family. 

In the end, he was arrested, she tried getting out of paying for a stay, they all were DNR'd and reported on the OTA they booked through and I got a good laugh and a good story out it. I chalk it up as a win!",22,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0B33E20>
286,You threw away my trash!!,"TL;DR at the end. 

10 years of working operations in 600+ bedroom hotels, and today I had the dumbest and most flabbergasting story ever. 

Housekeeping calls me (Manager on Duty) that I need to go to room #1478 because the guest is missing items from the room. 

I go up to meet them, middle aged couple, and the man immediately begins his story of how last night he went shopping for very expensive clothes (about €300 in value) and today after our Housekeeping cleaned their room, it disappeared. I asked them where the items were in the room, and he said it was in the bin. 

??

Apparently last night he didn’t have anywhere to put the clothes, and he didn’t have a bag, so he decided to put them in the trash can. Then during the day, while he was out, Housekeeping serviced the room and of course discarded the trash. This surprised him? 

I told him we will go the extra mile and crawl through the circa 50 bags of trash we threw into our compactor today to see if we can find the items - 3 of us spent 20 mins searching through the bags, no luck. 

I call to inform him, at which point he gets very upset and demands compensation. I explain that if items are in the trash, we will throw them away, and he threatens me that he will write a review on travel agent website about his experience as he is not happy. 

Imagine throwing out trash, how dare we.  I cannot wait for the review where he says he threw clothes into the trash and they were gone. 

TL;DR: Moron guest put clothes in the trash, and was surprised we threw them away.

287,Where do they grow these morons?,"Guys. GUYS. Been a while since I’ve been active in this sub, but tonight I had a good old fashioned moron that I needed to share.  
  
It was 2 AM and I was working on my paperwork for the night, getting ready to run audit at 3 when the damn phone rang.

Me: “Thank you for calling (hotel) this is CompilerCat, how can I help you?”  

Lady: “Hello, this is (her name). I’m at the airport and need a pickup.”  
  
M: “Oh, I’m so sorry, our airport shuttle service does stop at 1 AM, so your best option will be a ride share app like— wait…” *realizes her name isn’t on my arrivals* “I’m sorry, what did you say was the name on your reservation?”  
  
L: “Its (her name).”  
  
M: *yeah her name is not on here* “Um, I don’t see that here, is it possibly under a different name?”  
  
L: “No it’s definitely under (name). It’s for Saturday, but I was told I could get an early check in.”  
  
Ah hah, mystery solved then as to why it’s not on my list. It’s because today was FUCKING FRIDAY. This very special human being planned to check in at 2 AM on the day of her reservation by asking for an early check in. Now I don’t know what fucking planet this lady is from, but I don’t know a single hotel that does an early check in for 13 HOURS before normal checkin time.  
  
I also happen to have some very powerful knowledge: our management (may the hotel gods bless them for this decision) has told us that we are no longer going to offer ANY early check ins. That’s right: zero, nada, zilch, you may not check in before 3 pm on the day of your reservation. 🙌🏻  
  
M: *evil smile of the victorious night auditor spreading across my face* “Oh, I see the problem ma’am. Our system hasn’t switched over to the next day yet, so your reservation for tomorrow isn’t showing up. Unfortunately, I can’t check you into that reservation until check in time tomorrow.” 😈😈😈  
  
L: “Oh. So when can I check in today?”  
  
M: “3 PM.”  
  
L: “What? But I was told I could ask for early check in!”  
  
M: *enjoying this immensely, plus I can see she booked through hooking.com, so it doesn’t matter to me if she talked to Jesus himself, she’s getting nothing and going to like it* “Well our policy is that we do not allow check in before 3 PM. Our check in time is listed as 3 PM online. Unfortunately that is the earliest we can have a room ready for you.”  
  
L: “Well then how much is it for a room tonight?!”  
  
M: “For tonight my last room available is $369 plus tax.”  
  
L: “What that’s so expensive! I’ll just book online!” *hangs up*

289,"everyone, be more like this man.","there’s an old cowboy who has been at our hotel a few days. he was very sweet right from the beginning. one day he came up to the front desk so i could help him figure out how to fax a paper to his company and figure out the email on his phone. afterwards he tipped me $20 and he told me i was very nice and he appreciated my help so much. today i went outside to show him how to use our ice machine and helped him get a container to put his ice in, i turned around to go back inside and he told me to wait, pulled out his wallet and tipped me another $20. he had a conversation with me about how i should never let rude people get under my skin, i laughed and told him i used to work in the medical field so the people i meet at the front desk will never get to me, he laughed with me. he then told me to keep it up and continue killing people with kindness. he told me to keep up doing the good job that i do, and that he hopes i always remember him. i told him that i always will. i’m actually crying while i write this, i’ve never had such a compassionate and caring guest and he was surely the highlight of my whole week. who would’ve thought a cowboy would be so caring to a tatted up small town girl like myself. after having a crazy last two weeks surrounded by awful and rude guests his kind gestures meant more to me than he will ever know. be more like this man, we need more of him in the world. and this is why i love working at the front desk. 💛",13,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0B33FA0>
290,"„Oh well, guess I lost my only credit card” she said, casually","Important info: This story took place in Germany. Most hotels here don’t require guest’s credit card details, neither at booking nor check in. You can provide your details to have your booking be guaranteed, most people do it and some hotels don’t accept bookings without it, but, like credit cards themselves, it is way less common than in the US. 

I was working front desk late in the evening and got a call. They wanted two double rooms for the night and asked if the restaurant was still open. Great, every room sold counts in these difficult times. They arrive. Two parents, a son, a daughter. Mom does the checking in, which is odd because Dad booked and she has a different last name, but he’s right there so all good, right? Since they’re technically a walk in, I have them pay the night upfront in cash. They go up to their rooms and order room service. Food is brought up to their rooms. All running smoothly. Or so I thought. 

Two minutes later, the phone rings. It’s the mom and she informs me there’s a roach in her salad. Now, what you Muricans call “roach” isn’t really a thing here in Germany so there’s no way that’s what she means. But as they say, the guest is king, so I apologize profoundly, offering to have the whole meal remade for them. She just says no. Click. What an odd call I think, but hey, I tried. Problem solved, no reason to go and post on reddit about this. Oh wait.

Next day is my day off, mostly so I can come back the day after to work first shift. Luckily I’m not alone on this one. My colleague, let’s call her Iris, is doing check-outs while I’m in the back office preparing for a conference later in the day, always ready to jump in if it suddenly gets busy. Imagine my surprise when the family arrives for check out. They’ve added another night and also spent around 200€ in food and drinks. Iris presents them with the invoice and here’s where the complaints start. 

Mom goes from pleasant to furious in seconds. How dare we try and make her pay for the food? There was a roach in it, she was promised it would be compt! What kind of business even are we? Keep in mind that she hasn’t seen me yet. Which is about to change. Before Iris can respond I get out, greet them with the best smile I can master behind a mask and interject. I politely inform them that I’m so sorry they weren’t satisfied with our services but, since we offered to remake not only the salad but the whole meal, and they refused, we can’t comp it now. 

They were obviously trying to scam us out of those meals and at this point, I’m convinced there was nothing wrong with her salad. If I hadn’t been there, maybe Iris would have compt it just to appease them. But the best is yet to come. Mom opens her purse, takes one look and tells me she’s lost her credit card and can’t pay. Yes, just like that. No surprise, no panic at all, just “Oh well, guess my only way to pay my bill is gone. Now what are you gonna do about it?” Yes. She asked ME what I would do about it.

In my head I’m screaming “You better give me money NOW or we’re calling the cops!” at her, but I stay professional. Does her husband have a card? Of course not. They only share one. How would you react if you just realized you lost your one and only credit card? Probably at least a little bit shocked? Embarrassed maybe? Look for it immediately or at least make a call to make sure, whoever finds it can’t abuse it? Nope. You know when actors sometimes deliberately act the worst way they can, not emoting at all? That’s her right now. Only she’s doing it unironically. 

I ask them if they have enough cash to pay. Of course not. They have maybe enough for a third of the bill. Great, I say, we’ll take this as a down payment and send you the rest of the bill. Now, if they would please hand me their IDs so I can make a copy as proof. They claim they’ve lost those too, but I had seen them at check in so we already got names and addresses. I ask them for their address just for shits and giggles and off course, they give me a fake one. I decide not to call them out on it and simply imagine the looks on their faces when the invoice will still arrive at their address in a couple days. And then, without even so much as an apology, they leave. 

Iris and I share a look and, to my detriment she’s the first to say “Well, you’re explaining this to Mr. Freeze”, our code name for the GM. 

tl,dr: A\*\*hole guests make fake complaints to have their meal compt, then don’t have the money to pay the bill, even if it actually had been.",31,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0B34040>

292,Your parking lot is public property I don't have to leave,"I got on shift at 3pm everything was normal we we'rent that busy and I had 1/2 basket of laundry to sort through so I thought it was going to be a quiet night. Things started picking up around 5pm (the wave we call it where everything is quiet for 3 hours then super busy for 2 hours) so I'm running to and fro helping people with their needs.

Shortly after a guest comes by and whispers that there's a drunk person in our stairwell. I go and check and there is indeed a drunk person sitting in our stairwell. I ask him if he is staying with us and he says yes and gives me a bogus room #. I ask for a name so I can double check he has the right room number.

He starts to get testy with me and I tell him if he isn't staying with us he needs to leave the property, we don't allow loitering. He said ""I'm not loitering I'm just sitting here I'm not bothering anyone!"" I said that is in fact loitering and he would have to leave--I offered to call a taxi or the drunk tank for him and he said ""I'm not fucking drunk and I don't need no damn taxi."" After a bit more wrangling he got up to leave.

By that time more guests had shown up and he left the lobby through the front door. After 15 minutes or so I check to see if he's gone and he isn't. He's sitting by the curb near the driveway. I go and nicely ask him to leave the property. He ignores me and I ask him a second time to leave and he said ""Fuck you! This is public property I pay my taxes I can go where the fuck I want!"" I tell him that it is our parking lot thus is private property and I tell him I've asked politely enough times so I'll just call the police next.

He was silent for a moment then got up and headed towards to street so I thought that was the end of it. He got to the very corner parking space next to the sidewalk put up both his arms and fell backwards onto his backpack into the parking space. I say ""Sir"" and he cuts me off and yells ""I'm not going anywhere call the police park on top of me I don't caaaaAAAARRRRREEEEE!""

So I call the police then my manager who thankfully comes over (she doesn't live that far). The police arrive and after awhile they come in and ask me if the gentlemen hurt himself in our building. I tell him not that I'm aware of. He said the gentlemen is claiming he injured himself in our building. I tell him about the guy flopping down into our parking lot but that he didn't seem injured at all when I first made contact with him.

My manager reviewed the tapes and the guy slipped in behind a guest from a backdoor about 20 minutes before I made contact with him and didn't leave the stairwell. By that time the EMT's showed up and were checking him for injuries. My manager decided to stick around until everything was settled and about 30 minutes later as we were talking and sorting laundry we heard yelling from the parking lot. We went out and the guy was in a tussle with one of the cops and ending up getting face planted into the parking lot and arrested.",12,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0B34100>
293,A guest absolutely trashed a room and there’s no way to get them to pay damages,"So we had this family staying for awhile at the hotel I work at because they were looking for a house in my area. Whenever second shift checked them in they let them go ahead and go to their room without getting A WORKING CREDIT CARD. They ended up racking up thousands of dollars from staying and constantly extending at the last second and paid in cash when the card wasn’t working. Finally they checked out today but when housekeeping went in they found out that the family had absolutely fucking trashed the place. Diapers everywhere, messes everywhere, puke, shit, ripped up sheets, and permanent marking on the tv along with four tv remotes. We also found out that someone from one of the shifts gave them a bottle of cleaner and OUR VACUUM! We didn’t find this out until they left and they aren’t returning their calls. No one is owning up to letting them use the vacuum or who let them come in without a working card. I’ve only been here a week and I’m already done with this place.",25,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0B34160>
294,No cake,"Worked at a resort/marina on an island in the PNW near the US border. We had a lot of weddings as a destination spot not too far from the city. 

I worked front desk but my background was serving so occasionally I’d work some events and such to pick up extra $$. 

I had checked in this entire wedding party. It was one of the bigger ones we had that season ~150. All ages. They were absolutely lovely. Checkin went smooth. 

I finish my shift, change my shirt, and head down to the event. Everything is going SO smoothly. Guests are incredible. So. Nice. All we had to do was tidy and make sure the bar was stocked basically. So we were all sneaking beers and taking turns doing a lap around the room.

But it’s all too chill. Because we get through dinner service and the bride comes up to me and asks “any idea when the cake is coming out?” And it’s like RECORD SCRATCH. 

Hold up. Cake? I pull my BEST professional face and say “hold on I’ll go check” while RUNNING to the back to check the BEO. There is nothing about a cake. 

Our DUMBASS events manager would frequently fuck up the BEOs but this was an EPIC ball drop. This is a wedding. Outside of a white dress people think cake when talking about a wedding, right? 

Talk to chef (being generous there because common. He was a cook at best) who is also absolutely flabbergasted that there is no cake on the damn BEO. Call events dude to yell at him but he’s just like “whoops”.

Keep in mind this is a very remote place so running out to get a cake from a store was not happening.

I levelled with the party that the events manager fucked up and it wasn’t on there but not to worry because the chef was gonna whip something up ASAP. I also told them I would personally see to it that they would meet with events in the AM so they could “discuss” ie dude had better give them some money for this failure. Somehow they were SO NICE about this.. I got so lucky they didn’t rip my head off, but they probably realized it wasn’t *my* fault.

We just snuck them extra booze and started dancing and such to keep guests occupied.

All while this poor cook starts making a TIRAMISU in like, record time. Sweat pouring down his face, so much angry muttering to himself. I’m running back and forth to the party to give them updates.

It gets made. It is hideous. We cut it up and serve it out to maybe 1/4 of the people since it’s a tiramisu…. and then we drink all the alcohol. Events guy gave them a couple vouchers for things around the resort and didn’t get in trouble because of course he didn’t. Sigh. 

TLDR - no cake for wedding. So much stress. Pulled cake out of butt. Threw events manager under the bus, deservedly.",35,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0B341C0>
295,"I am the manager, Karen","This is a card I don't pull too often, but on paper I am the front desk manager. At my hotel, that mostly means that I train people, and get calls from night auditors at 3am.

So, our hotel is in a small town, but we're almost always booked. I came in at three today, and we had one room at $139. Our discounts recently changed, and went into the laughable territory, so maybe you can get it three bucks cheaper. Gone are the days of 10% discounts for us. That said, the room was booked by 4pm.

Enter Karen (thankfully via phone)

She calls, and asks if we have rooms. ""No, ma'am, unfortunately we are booked."" The call ends, but the story goes on. 

She calls back, asks the same question, and gets the same answer.  ""Well, when I called earlier, I was told that you had plenty of rooms. You just sold out? I was told I could get a room for $77.""

""Um... we don't have a $77 rate. ""

""The woman I spoke to said that I could get a 10% discount, because I'm visiting my son at the college!""

Now this is just laughable, because that would imply that our base rate is around $85. This isn't a sketchy motel off the interstate, and even when I worked at one almost ten years ago the rate was $89. So I try to tell her that we don't have any rates that low even if we did have rooms, and she must have the wrong hotel. 

At this point Karen does what they do, and asks to speak to my manager because she wants to know why she was lied to! She'd come all the way from Florida, after all! 

So, there's my time to flex the title I got by accidentally working here so long that the old FDM left. ""I am the manager."" She then goes on with the same argument, and insists that this was the hotel she'd called. I kept explaining that we were booked, and no such rate exists, even if we were giving 10% discounts. 

Then she pulls the mega Karen, and asks to speak to my manager, who's been gone for hours. I had enough at that point, and told her,  ""Listen, I've already told you that I am the manager, and that we have nothing available, and we certainly don't have anything available for $77. I have no clue who told you that we did. ""

There was a moment of silence, but at last she hung up. It was a good thing too, because I was about to do it myself, and I'd hate for her to show up in person, and give me the wrath of whatever comes next after mega Karen. 

Anyway, I was only on until eight, so I just left early awhile after that.",37,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0B34220>
296,Handed in my resignation today!,"Obligatory ""I'm on mobile sorry for format mistakes"" message 

Let me start by saying I absolutely adore the people I work WITH, so this was not an easy choice. That being said, I did not enjoy the people I work FOR. 

Just like any typical hotel, the front desk does many jobs. This is not uncommon and was such the case when I signed on for supervisor 7 months ago. However, it quickly escalated once we lost multiple people at the beginning of the winter season. Now, most people working in hotels would say ""at least it happened right before your slow season"" and they would be wrong. 
I work at an airport hotel in a city that gets lots of snow. The amount of distressed passengers we got this season from cancelled flights was astronomical. Almost fully booked every night. Going from 10% occupancy to 80% in a 10 minute span. Couple that with being understaffed and it was a nightmare everyday. It was too much. Multiple times I had been verbally abused by guests and when I got called in to my managers office and was told that it was my fault because my customer service was slipping, I replied to him that his customer service might slip a little too if he was getting screamed at and cursed at for simply enforcing policy. At that point, I knew it was time to go. 

I have been, without luck, searching for a more suitable hotel to move to. Thankfully, an amazing opportunity came along for better pay, better hours and only about a third of the work. I'm ecstatic. I handed in my official resignation this morning and will be finishing the week off here and taking a few days for myself before heading off on a new adventure. Wish me luck!",20,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0B34280>
297,Lunchbox issues!,"It's time for another story from Turkish transferman.

 It seems that there is some problem with lunchboxes. Most of them were... pretty lightweighted. I mean, they were almost empty. Bread with no sausage, or sausage without bread, some pieces of fruits, maybe some salad... And that's it! Nothing more. 

It seems like some hotels just doing lunchboxes for ""the gap"", to mention that they do serve such a thing. Many people expect something valuable (in calories), but intead, they get disappointment.",1,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0B342E0>
298,Crazy Guest Freaks Out about Neighbor's Sex,"(Sorry for formatting, I essentially copied from our MOD report)

Guest called around 12:45 to complain about their neighbors having loud sex. She was very upset, and needed to vent.

 In the conversation, she brought up how her previous room had the bathtub issue, as well as bed bugs (this is not something I have seen reported, so I am not sure what is going on now).

 I apologized for those issues. She kept saying that we need to space out rooms, and how it was inappropriate to put someone next to her. 

I apologized for the inconvenience, but told her that the nature of hotels is to expect a neighbor. I am not trying to put any blame on her, but it sounds like she is just trying to start an issue with her neighbors, and I have no idea how to handle it. 

She went from thanking my co-worker for her help, to being a paranoid wreck about me asking her neighbors to quiet down, because they might bother her/knock on her door/she would have to kick their asses. 

I went up to her floor around 1:10 AM to see if I could hear any noise for myself, and this guest was standing in the hallway, seemingly in a way to start an issue with her neighbors (contrary to her previous concern of them knocking on her door). 

I had spoken to them (the guests in the other room), and they are very calm and respectful for being bothered at 1am by the front desk guy. 

While in the hallway, I let her know that, again, having neighbors in a hotel is something to expect, and that it was completely inappropriate to be standing in the hallway waiting for them. 

She said she was waiting for me to ""get off my ass and actually do something"" and I told her that the situation was handled, and that her escalating, and instigating would not be tolerated anymore.

 I told her to go into her room, and leave them alone for the rest of the night. 

I offered the other guests an upgrade to move out from her annoyance (they did not move, which is a pity because this lady is freaking crazy).

 In our original phone conversation, I tole her that the front desk could, in the future, space apart guests if room availability would allow, but that it was an unreasonable expectation to have the front desk be able to predict who would, or would not have loud sex.

 I also feel terrible that I have now, one very upset paranoid guest in one room who has made big accusations about how horrible we are, and upset guests in the other who have been contacted by the front desk at 1am because of a nosy neighbor. 

I wanted to solve a problem for the guest, and she just wanted to complain (that's fine, but then she escalated). 

She has said that she will be checking out tomorrow since we run a horrible hotel, and I let her know that if she chose to do that, that would be fine. 

Very weird situation, that did not have a good answer regardless. 

Update: At this point, the situation is bizarre. The guest seems to be trying to start a fight with neighbors, and me because she had bed bugs and they had sex she could hear. It's unwarranted, and confusing behavior. I would label her as a nosy neighbor. 

Ultimately, I let her know that it is her choice to give us her business or not, and that we would do what we can to accommodate, but that I am no longer interested in playing games tonight. 

Update 2: She reached out to hotels tonight to cancel her last night, which I approved, BUT she also wants every other night returned to her due to the bed bugs (15th-17th). I don't see a report of bed bugs from her previous room. I said I needed more info before I could allow that.",17,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0B34340>
299,The Wedding from Hell,"This happened a few months ago, tl,dr at bottom.

If you go through my post history, I work at an all-suites limited service property set up for extended stay. If it happens after hours, it is up to the desk to handle it. This takes place between my property, and the sister property, a hotel that shares a parking lot but is much more transient and is mainly standard rooms, of the same brand and franchise owner, let's call it H2. 110 rooms at my hotel, 127 at H2. 

I get to work at 3, working til 11 as usual, and notice we have a large (20+ rooms) wedding group checking in that afternoon. I speak with sales(SM), and learn they have booked our large conference room (40 person) for the night. Sales informs me that they have been making odd requests before arrival, so I steel myself for the usual entitled suburbanites.

I check in a couple wedding rooms, and notice they are bringing in supplies to decorate the conference room for their rehearsal dinner. Fine, this is nothing strange. What is strange, is that they brought in a luggage cart with 4, count them 4, 60 gallon igloo coolers. The cart seemed very heavy, so they were full. SM steps out of the office, and after a quiet ""aw hell no"" she informs me that she needs to speak with the bride's mother (EB for entitled you know what). 

Sales has a come to jesus meeting with EB about what is allowed in the contract and what is not. At this point I recognize decor around the lobby and lounge from the wedding. SM wraps up and I get a chance to speak with her:

OP: ""They're decorating the lobby, that's not allowed is it?""

SM: ""no, they also decorated the patio (connected to the conference room) and I told them that's public space, they can't do that. Also, they wanted add-ons today that they denied when negotiating the contract. (Our AV requires a tech to set it up, and they wanted to play guitar hero).""

OP: ""they also brought in some big coolers, what are those?""

SM: ""they brought alcohol. They signed a waiver, as per the contract, but it's a early 20s bride and groom. So be ready for the group to drink a lot.""

OP: ""wait, if they brought their own booze, they aren't buying from our bar. Please tell me we charged them a lot for that!""

SM: ""nope. OP, I know, but the contract was negotiated and signed before I even started. Now we have to honor it and just take the L for the bar."" 

OP: ""fine. Whatever. Corporate wants this bar to make money, looks like it never will. Now I have an excuse.""

Apparently, SM had to literally print the signed contract and show EB where it said they only paid for the conference room. They were not allowed to take over the hotel simply because they had 40 rooms between 2 hotels. After MAKING her understand, not asking, that they could not make other guests feel like our hotel was the wedding's private venue, could SM convince EB to take down the decorations. 

But, everything that should have come down came down, and peace was in the hotel again. For the time being.

I continue to check in the wedding, and run into a singular problem with the guests. Aside: our housekeeping is fair to middling at best. Often we are waiting until 5pm for enough rooms to be ready for our arrivals, forget about specific rooms. I have to play musical rooms at the desk more often than should be necessary.

 Anyways. The wedding guest all want to be on the same floor. Next door to each other if possible. I joke to my rather green FDA that they all want to sleep in the same bed. As we are checking them in, it's very much a ""do we have a room ready? Yes? Then that one is their room."" Situation. Room location is purely at the discretion of which housekeeper is moving faster. Keep in mind, this is 4pm, an hour after check in time. 

I get one guest, let's call him D for Dave, as that's as generic as I can get. D wants his two rooms next to each other. System says: two different floors. That's what I have to work with so I prep damage control and my contritest apologies to get him to accept distance vs check in time. 

D: ""I thought check in time was 3pm!""

OP: ""Yes sir, it is. And I have rooms ready to check you in to right now! They just aren't the specific rooms you want. If you like, you are more than welcome to hang out with us in the lobby until the room number you want is ready.""

D: ""How long will that be?""

I call housekeeping on the radio and learn it will be a good while until the room is ready.

OP: ""About an hour sir""

D: ""That's ridiculous! My cousin/uncle/John Cleese is in the room next door and said the housekeeper just left that room!"" 

I decide to take some flak for housekeeping. I know they work hard, and we are a team after all. 

OP: ""Regardless, sir, that room is not ready at the moment. I can still check you in if you like. We've already done everything necessary to get you a room immediately.""

D: ""fine. But that's not good. That's very not good!""

I apologize, and he leaves irritated but nonetheless with two room keys. The night goes on and I don't have too many problems from the wedding after that interaction. I was keeping an eye on the clock with their meeting room time, at the end of their time I went to remind them and they were finishing cleaning up. Overall, they didn't destroy the room (surprised Pikachu face). Just some trash stacked next to the full trash can, which is nothing to complain about. So ended my time (so I thought) and I could simply move on. 

Boy was I wrong. 1 am and 4 beers deep, my weekend NA calls and says she has a noise complaint about the wedding on the patio. They left the conference room and commandeered the lounge/patio for their party, and rooms directly face the patio. 

My NA was fairly green, so I tell her to inform the party that if they don't quiet down, they will be kicked out. No concessions, no wiggle room. We take noise complaints seriously, and only issue one warning. She has me on her Bluetooth earbuds so I can hear that she has to shout to get them under control. They aquiese and the dull roar I hear over Bluetooth reduces to a quiet din. I tell my NA that if she gets one more noise complaint, kick out the lot. Wedding be dammed.

I continue my night, and after about an hour and 3 more beers I get a call from the NA at H2. Once again I am on Bluetooth, so I can hear nearly everything she can hear 

H2 NA: ""OP I'm about to call the cops on these people""

I go from 0 to sober much faster than I have any right to.

Aside: I worked at H2 for 10 months before moving to my hotel. I trained H2 NA. She takes no prisoners and no crap and is one of the best FDAs we had.

OP: ""ok. But if you take that step, there is no going back. The only way that ends is someone in jail for the night. What's going on?"" 

H2 NA: ""they left your hotel and I was waiting for them at the front entrance. I told them they had to go to their rooms and be quiet for the night. About 20 of them got down to the patio by going through the back door and walking around. I told them as long as they were quiet they could stay, but as soon as I got a noise complaint they had to break it up. I got a noise complaint and spoke with EB, but several of the group walked into the parking lot and started drinking around their cars. I've told them to disperse. They haven't, and I'm getting more noise complaints.""

OP: ""ok, call the cops. Tell the cops anyone not in their rooms is fair game. Tell the regular guests to go to their rooms until the cops finish-""

At this point I'm interrupted by H2 NA forcibly telling someone that they cannot do whatever they are doing, and she is calling the cops.

H2 NA: ""OP they just broke my doors"" (our doors are locked at 10pm for security reasons) ""they are gonna go. I'm not having this tonight."" Apparently one of the wedding guests forced our locked front doors. These doors are not bolted, simply turned off, per fire code. But if someone forces them, they have to be reset by maintenance.

While she was saying this, I heard all manner of abuses being hurled at her. From names, to threats, everything. She's a POC, and these are drunk suburban white folk, so you can imagine the things said to her. She hangs up and I get on the phone to H2 FOM, my counterpart. I talk with him about what we should do and debate going in myself, completely unscheduled so that I can render assistance as a MOD. In the end, he convinced me to let our NAs handle it, as they need to be able to function autonomously and this should be a learning experience.

The next day, I go into work ready to spend all 8 on damage control, telling people that they will not be refunded as they violated our rules. Come to find out, one person was arrested for disoderly conduct after being hidden in the rooms of several wedding guests. After a merry goose chase, the cops ran out of patience and hauled him off to county. 

Ultimately, the fallout amounted to 3 rooms we had to have evicted as they would not check out on time, and 2 bad reviews. Responding to them was a fine practice in the art of diplomacy as I believe Winston Churchill put it: ""diplomacy is selling someone a ticket to hell and having them look forward to the trip.""

Tl,Dr: wedding fucked around long enough, got to the find out stage and learned hotels have more authority than they think.

Edit: after some quick google-fu I found Churchill never said that. Regardless, it's a good way to look at customer service",37,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0B343A0>
300,An ill prepared hotel that is understaffed.,"I dread this upcoming weekend and following week. Everything has slowly been picking up so we have been averaging between 20-50% occupancy every night. But my hotel has been having major issues and we are not prepared for the almost 100% occupancy that is upon us this week. Rooms having bad leaks, water not getting hot, boiler has just stopped working some days, and just general cleanliness issues. 

The leaks can be isolated but the problem is that my front desk during the day keeps putting guests in rooms that are the possible cause of these leaks. And since a guest is in there maintenance can’t fix the problem. Front desk has been told to not use those rooms but they still do.

We’ll probably lose as much money as we make for the next week because guests will be wanting refunds for these issues if they aren’t fixed. But they can’t get fixed if we aren’t making money.

Everyone in the area is till too understaffed for these kinds of weekends. We shouldn’t be accepting these kinds of group contracts, it will most likely hurt us more than help.

They honestly need to shut us down and fix as many of these issues as they can before taking large group reservations again. The whole situation is very much a double edged sword. We are just completely ill equipped for this kind of week.",7,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF5ADF70>

2nd: No, the maintenance guy had one of his friends showering in one of the empty rooms and I checked guests into it. 

Me: *Dumbfounded silence*

2nd: Yeah, he was suddenly very concerned with a room being dirty and came running from upstairs, and offered to bring guests new keys and ""clean the room."" GM wants to make sure that he didn't give the guy a key for him to use a different empty.

I don't think I'm gonna check the rooms, there's like 25 vacant rooms and the maintenance guy is sketchy, so I'm sure his ""friends"" are too.

“Ok sir what’s the name on the reservation

As most of you know, we don't charge this fee for service animals.  Guests know this and often try to take advantage of it.  But, you know that already.  


I had a couple check in last week, with a dog in tow.  Part of my check in spiel is to ask if they're traveling with an animal.  They said yes, they have a service dog.  I was going to let it slide until I hear barking.  Down at my feet is a little black terrier mix with a bright red EMOTIONAL SUPPORT ANIMAL vest on.  Our interaction goes something of:  


Me: Ma'am, I'm not sure if you're aware, but an ESA is not considered a service animal, so I will have to charge the pet fee.  
Her:  No I have the papers right here.  
Me: Oh, I don't need those.  Can you tell me what services the animal is trained to provide?  
Her:  Emotional support.  
Me:  ESAs are not service animals by ADA standards.  So I have to charge the fee.  
Her: Okay well I can just cancel it then.  


Her and her husband go back and forth a few times while I'm standing there like it's a thing to do.  They get to bickering about the room and keeping the booking and so on and so forth.

Me: I couldn't tell you.  But I will have to charge you.  
Him:  But it's a service animal it's against the law for you to charge us.  
Me:  Would you like me to print a copy of the ADA laws for you, sir?  


Long story short, I got the pet fee.  They had tried to contest it in the morning, but management backed me up.  


Kind of.  


Yesterday, our AGM had a chat with me about it.  Apparently, the guest left a very negative review and a low score for us because I was ""so mean and rude"".  So the big guy in charge said I should have let it slide and not give them any trouble.  I look her dead in the face and ask ""So am I no longer to enforce the policies?""  Of course, she said no I need to enforce policy and I was in the right, but the HBIC thinks I should had let it slide.   


Well.  He wasn't happy when he called me about it.  I asked him the same question I asked her, tripping him up, then followed it with ""If you want me to both ignore and enforce the hotel policy, then what exactly do you want me to do?""  I got chewed out a little, but I stuck to my guns.  When I finally asked ""Am I just supposed to let guests walk all over me and ignore procedure just to get a positive review?"" he decided this wasn't worth the effort and ended our chat.    


Sure, I could had handled it nicely.  But I'm a grumpy, stubborn old auditor who is good at his job and doesn't take crap from guest nor manager.

tldr;  guest is salty because they have to pay for their ESA.  Management backs me up, then chastises me when the hotel gets a bad score over it.",50,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0BC44C0>
306,"I fought fire with fire, not literally.","For context I work night audit at an extended stay hotel so we have lots of long term guests. Recently my state's National Guard units were activated to help the hospitals battle Omicron so we have about 50 Guardsmen currently staying for about 3 months or until they are told they can leave.

Ever since day one there has been one Guard member who absolutely refuses to use his room key on the key pad in our vestibule to unlock the front door because per policy we have to lock the door from 11 pm to 5 am because of numerous factors like guest and staff safety, plus the area my hotel is in is right in between 2 homeless camps so we try to limit opening the door ourselves as much as possible to keep non-guests out.

Let's call the guard member Roger Ramjet. Roger has decided since I sit at the desk, which he sees clearly from the door, that he doesn't need to use his key to regain access to the hotel despite my nice laminated sign that explains the doors are locked between certain hours and has an arrow that points to the key pad in which he can swipe his room key to get back in. At first I was letting him in no problem, I just assumed he didn't see my sign, but I put it at eye level every night so he should have seen it regardless, but after 2 straight weeks of him interrupting my audit paperwork I informed him that his key will let him back in without my need to get up while I'm elbows deep in revenue and tax spreadsheets. Roger shrugs it off and says ""whatever.""

It has now been a month of him doing this and I've told him at least half a dozen times to use his key, he ignored me but last night when I told him again he replied ""you're the night person, it's your job to let me in, I don't have to use my key if I don't want to."" I didn't respond, and technically it's not my job, I'm not a doorman ok. I did speak to my supervisor about it but upper management won't do much else because they don't want to piss off the Guard to a point that they'd take that nice chunk of government money every night to another hotel.

I decided I'm going to fight fire with fire. Tonight was the first time in a week that Roger didn't show up during my audit so I was able to get it done in a timely manner. Once I was done I decided that I wasn't going to sit at the desk like he'll expect me to be. We have a big spacious lobby so I can sit practically anywhere and still see the front door as well as the desk and I'm still close enough to the desk that I can answer the phone if it rings. I put the 'away from desk' sign up and point it directly at the front door to where he will be able to see it clearly and decided to sit in a corner of the lobby with my iPad but still keep an eye on things. 

Roger finally shows up, I see him but he doesn't see me. He stood at the door for about 5 minutes, looks around, starts knocking and waits. I'm not at all ashamed that I'm not opening the door for him because he has a room key, he's never asked for a replacement, plus even if he lost his key there's an intercom in the vestibule he can use to get my attention. After 10 minutes he finally gets it and used his guest room key to open the door. It wasn't until he was standing at the elevator that he saw me just sitting in a corner in a big comfy chair reading my Stephen King book on my iPad. He glared at me for a second but I didn't care because I had gotten even with him hopefully once and for all.

Before the comments commence I would like to add that sitting in our back office watching cameras is not an option like at most others as my hotel is new and was constructed between 2019 and 2021 and COVID wreaked havoc on the budget and security cameras were cut as a way to save the owner money. I've heard rumors we are supposed to have cameras installed at some point this year but we will see.

TLDR: Long term guest refuses to use room key to unlock front door after hours so I intentionally hide from him to make him use his key instead of depending on me all the time.",84,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0BC4520>
307,"“It’s a charge, because the text says it’s a charge.”","For context, I’m a GSM at a Schmilton property. We have a guest staying with us who, not for the lack of trying on my behalf, does not understand the difference between an authorisation and a charge. Our system is a little wonky, so we offered to take her card off the reservation and have her come pay once a week. She’s been really good about it, but one little (read: not so little) problem has arose. 

She claims that charges have not returned to her card from everything we charged her previously. I personally have gone in and voided all authorisations from her card being on file, releasing them on my end. She says that they haven’t been returned because her bank’s texting system hasn’t sent her texts about deposits in her account. 

I have tried to tell her that they weren’t charges, but authorisations, temporary holds that release once we let them go. She insists that she would have gotten a text, and I advise her to call her bank about them to make sure they weren’t doing something on their end. She comes down last Saturday, and informs me that she’s reporting it as fraudulent charges, despite not having called and talked to her bank about them. Cool. Go ahead. Doubt it’ll go any where. She then proceeds to tell me that until it’s cleared up, that she won’t be paying any more. 

I know, I know. I should have informed her that that’s not how it works, but I just wanted to be nice to her. She pays, but, lo and behold! The mighty system ops is struggling to process credit cards! So it fails authorisation, I call her, tell her to come down, and snapshot the fail screen just in case. She does come down, she sees the screenshot, and we try it again. It goes through on her end, great! But… that’s when I noticed our system having trouble. 

She leaves because she got the text it went through. Five minutes later, my system finally returns to me, telling me that it couldn’t process because of internal issues. My manager told me to leave it be a few days, see if the system would clear it up and process it. I checked today, and it didn’t. I sent a text to my gm, asking him to talk to her tomorrow, seeing as I won’t be there. 

I guess this post is just kind of a rant on how technology is a hindrance as much as a blessing, and a way to better explain authorisations to people so they aren’t as confusing. Thanks for listening!

308,Discounts? I want more discounts!,"I have a guest that checked in today for 2 nights. She wanted to get a discount because our restaurant and bar are closed because of covid. Even though on our website it does stated that our bar and restaurant are closed! Only if she takes a little of time to look at our website then she would see that they are closed. 

I get it, it’s inconvenient for guest to have to look for that information, so we gave them a very hefty discount for their room on the first night. However, she still asking for a discount for the second nigh or have the the amenity  fee waived.

I told her that we already gave her a very big discount on the first night but she still insisted to get a discount for the second night and said that we didn’t have that information on our website. Like really? 

Our hotel is in the middle of downtown and there are tons amazing of bar and restaurants nearby that is walking distance. Just because bar and restaurant and bar are closed, doesn’t mean you won’t use other amenities in the hotel. Just to save some headache, I waived the amenities fee for the 2nd night. 

Even after we gave her a discount and amenity fee waived, she still wanted to speak to my manager when he comes in the next day.",30,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0BC45E0>
309,I need help,"Hello, 
I work the night shift as a hotel front desk.
Today we had group accommodation in our hotel(most of the hotel was booked) and as a result we had just one double room left(loaded for single use) from a client that said he couldn’t arrive. Just this evening I get a call from a couple wanting to book a double room(our double rooms have twin beds that can be separated or put together according to guest wants). They also said they will arrive shortly. Unfortunately I didn’t see that it was single loaded and accommodated them there. An hour later the man from the room tells me he needs extra towels for the room because they had one pair. I immediately realised that the room was single loaded and apologized for the mistake. I went up to the cleaning ladies’ office and gave them to him. Unfrtunately, they will have to connect their beds themselves(essentially they will have to move it a little bit to the side). They didn’t make a big fuss about it but thy weren’t very happy either.
I’m honestly freaking out right now because this has never happened to me before. Mistakes at work are terrible and worst of all I had a sixt sense feeling right whe they called to go up to the room and see if it’s signle loaded(nobody at our hotel uses the SGL loaded indicator in the hotel software, we essentially just tell each other when the other comes to work).
My question is how big of a mistake do you think this is",17,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0BC4640>
310,Any one can help or give me advice?,"So my managers made a group chat where they would message us some of things that we would need to know (ie a certain guest that needs look out for, or to tell us to stay at the hotel if there is a snow storm or anything new). But now a days, they just send messages there saying ‘for now you have to do this’ or ‘please advise guest that…’ 
Where now whenever I see a message from them. I feel like that it was either mine or my co-worker’s fault where there was a mistake in a reservation, or the payment method or at checking in a guest. I just been feeling pressured on by this which cause me to sometimes make common mistakes. 

Do any of you have group chats? Or does you managers also do this? I’m open to your opinions and advices. Thank you!",17,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0BC46A0>
311,The 12 Inch Pianist,"I'm the Night Concierge at a 5\* UK hotel.

Last week, we had probably the most entitled stuck up narcissists I've ever met staying with us. The night started out when these two guys on a business trip were drinking in the bar. One of them asked the bar manager if he could play the piano in the bar. The Manager responded; ""I'm sorry but we don't have any live music tonight and we don't allow people to just come up and play the piano."" The Guest who we nicknamed ""12 Inch Pianist"" wasn't amused and he got quite annoyed and started to berate the Bar Manager demanding to see the written rule about this whilst his friend I'll call Ken started to film. The Bar manager went to inform the hotel's Night Manager what was happening and NM came through to the bar and explained the rules. Ken and 12 Inch Pianist called the rule stupid and that they should let him play because apparently he: ""gets paid thousands of £s"" to play the piano and he was doing it for free. Once NM left, the two of them talked loudly about how much of a C\*\*\* NM was and declared to the Bar Manager. ""We have the money to buy this place. We're gonna do it and sack all of you for disrespect."" 12 Inch Pianist then marched over to the piano and started playing and declared ""I should be f\*\*\*ing paid for this. I've played in some of the top venues around the world and I did this as a gift.""

Later the two guests walked through reception to go back to their room and they decided first that they'd berate NM by telling him they would have him fired and that they've ruined their stay by not allowing them to enjoy themselves. I intervened asking them not to speak to my colleagues in such a manner. 12 Inch Pianist responded by telling me; ""Go f\*\*\* yourself."" In 10 years of hospitality, I have never shouted at a guest. I told him; ""Don't you dare speak to me like that again or you'll be leaving this hotel shortly."" He then responded with; ""F\*\*\* you."" as him and Ken left to go upstairs.

Ken came back down 5 minutes later and gave us a half assed apology claiming his colleague was European so supposedly that gave him the right to be rude. Me and NM accepted his apology and told him that we will not be spoken to in the manner in which they did. Ken backtracked again demanding he see the written rule about the bar piano and NM informed him, ""There is no written rule, it's a thing called common courtesy. We asked you not to play the piano, but still you did."" Ken claimed again how he was going to have both of our jobs and then left with 12 Inch Pianist to find another bar. They returned around 2AM and got their phones out to record themselves berating us again. 12 Inch Pianist claimed to me that ""You should show me more respect. Even if I called you a C\*\*\* and took a S\*\*\* in the lobby, you should still treat me with respect. You have no idea who I am and what I could do to you."" I responded; ""If you did any of those things, you'd be thrown out of the hotel. You realise there's families with children staying at the moment? I would also have the police called for indecent exposure."" Eventually both of them went to bed.

In the morning, me and NM informed the hotel manager who has since gotten in touch with their company and they have been blacklisted from our hotel and any other properties associated with our brand. According to one of my day colleagues, they said everything with their stay was great on checkout. I wander if they sobered up, thought about what total turds they had been and realised that this was a business trip and therefore they'd get hell from their company. Either way, they are without a doubt the worst people I have ever dealt with.",34,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0BC4700>

The rules for men say we have to have “business appropriate” hair and “clean shaven or an established beard”. Fuck me I fell nervous like “is my hair business enough” and “is my beard established what is established mean?”  I’ve meant both of them before and the DOO even hugged me but I’m still shitting myself that I’ll get into trouble lol. I also have painted nails which is technically only allowed in the girls uniform but my both said she doesn’t have an issue which gender uniform policy I follow which is nice.

314,Nice Ring! I Don’t Care,"Just happened but weird enough interaction that I(25f) almost wonder if I am just reading the situation weird or what lmao.

Stars of today’s weird encounter:
G - Guest, S - Me, Chef

Guest starts walking towards the front desk, about 20-30 feet from the front door. Looks semi-blue collar white guy, about 40-50yrs old by himself.
Usually the friendliest guests from my perspective so I don’t hesitate to greet them at the time they walk through the door. He is my last arrival so I already have his info pulled up. Dude has Never been to the hotel but all is good! 

S: Hello! …. Hello?! …. Checking in?
G: GOOD AFTERNOON!
S: Good afternoon sir! Checking in?
G: I’m doing fine, *Hacking* yes I’m checking in. *Coughing*
S: What’s the last name?
G: Doe
S: Alrighty! I’ve got you pulled up Mr. Doe, do you have your ID?
G: *Stares at me for a second like he’s trying to read me* Yes I have my ID. *coughs*

I put and confirm the rest of his information. He stares at me the entire time except to cough.
While proceeding to get him to sign the reg card, he points out my ring.
G: That’s an absolute beautiful sapphire.
S: Oh! Thank you! It’s my engagement ring. It’s called red fire black opal. (My favorite gem, with red and yellow streaks)

2 things left on reg card to complete
G: *Stares after finishing* Yeah I know. Oh I don’t care about anything else you have to say about this(ring?) or that(paperwork?) *Glances at reg card*
S: …. Okay sir? *Tries to ignore him* These are our breakfast hours. Go up to the # floor, take two rights - straight down.
Guest stands there staring at me for a few seconds until Chef walks up and starts chatting.
G grabs his items, stares at me while chuckling to himself.
I proceed to then sanitize literally everything he touched or was around while relief-chatting to Chef.

I’ve checked in many off-putting individuals in my time but “predator-like” stare made it the most..eck.",8,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0BC4820>
315,Black Out,"During one of my shifts at a popular hotel chain, I was helping the owner of the hotel put some supplies away that the hotel needed for breakfast. I was putting oatmeal packets away in the cabinets of the kitchen and making sure everything was neatly stacked. The owner had wandered off back into the lobby so I finished putting away the supplies and made it to the front desk.

The wife of the owner and his little girl began talking to me as I sat down, just talking about random stuff about the hotel and we were making conversation. The owner was at his truck that was parked in the entrance looking to see if there was anymore supplies that we had missed. While chatting with his wife, all of a sudden, we heard a loud KABOOM! We all got startled and I was confused as to where the large KABOOM sound came from. It was accompanied by the sound you hear when fireworks fizzle down to the ground after being lit and thrown into the sky. So I asked myself, did someone just light off a firework just really close? The hotel was near a neighborhood, literally right across the street from one, so maybe someone was playing with fireworks. Or maybe there was thunder? I wasn't sure so I went outside to investigate with the owner's wife and his kid. The owner looked at me and said that he just saw a transformer blow out. I looked inside the hotel and it was pitch black. The lights had gone out in the entire lobby. The only thing that illuminated the lobby was the fact that it was still daylight outside so the lighting helped me to see inside the lobby. The owner told me to call my manager D to get down here so he can call the electric company to see when the power could be turned back on. I'm not sure why he couldn't do it himself but I obliged and called my manager who laughed at the fact that the owner didn't do it himself but he too obliged and told me he'd be there in five minutes since he lived up the road from the hotel.

The owner, his wife, and his kid went on their merry way and left the hotel. I was stuck by myself waiting for my manager to show up. Luckily no guests had came down to complain yet but the computers, the front desk phone and other landline phone, and the fridge for the snack shop were all out. Nothing was working so I knew this was going to be a long shift. I knew it was going to be an even longer shift when I heard a bigger KABOOM! and that meant another transformer just blew.

My manager arrived and tried to check to see if anything in the hotel was working at all. The fuse box wasn't working to turn anything back on, half of the emergency lights weren't working, and it was getting darker by the minute. The back up generators refused to work to power anything besides the emergency lighting. He called the electric company who said it might be hours before they could get the power back on. Which means we were stuck in darkness for a long time. 

Sooner or later, the dreaded part of this whole experience decided to happen. Guests were beginning to arrive to check into their rooms. We couldn't even program a key, let alone check them into the rooms. Luckily we had keys we made in advance for the guests that we did have, but we couldn't check them in electronically to their rooms. The elevators didn't work either so guests who were coming in and trying to check in, they had to use the back stairwells to get access to their rooms. Which didn't go over well for some people but this was a situation we couldn't control. We allowed the guests to sign the forms that they needed to sign for their rooms and gave them the keys. My manager said we'd just keep track of those who have checked in with the forms they signed and we'll electronically check them in when the power gets back on. So, we did. Some guests though who were beginning to check in were not pleased with the situation and asked for a refund for their room and left, which my manager just said they'd get a 10% or so discount off the price they paid because this wasn't a situation that happened because of us.

Guests who came in to get a room for the night were denied because we couldn't make new reservations for them whatsoever so we had a lot of unhappy guests that night that needed a room.

We had a ton of guests coming down and complaining about the fact that the power was still out three  hours later and nothing was being done about it. My manager had to explain to them that this wasn't due to us, the whole neighborhood surrounding the hotel was without power too and it was up to the electric company to send somebody down to fix the power situation. We had so many guests that night asking for refunds or discounts on their room, which some were just happy with a discount. Some were mad that we couldn't offer a complete refund. But we couldn't do anything about it. Some guests were complaining that they couldn't use the stairs because of their medical issues which the only thing I could do was apologize because I couldn't do anything to fix the elevators. Eventually guests were complaining that they couldn't use the stairs because the emergency lights were now off inside the stairwells. Which we couldn't do anything about so we recommended they used the flashlight on their phones. Some people couldn't so I had to usher people to their rooms with the use of my flashlight and I also had to direct people to the stairwells my entire shift with the use of my flashlight.

Eventually after hours and hours of guests complaining and demanding refunds and me having to usher people to the stairwells, the power finally came back on at 10pm at night. An hour before my shift was supposed to end. Luckily my coworker didn't have to spend her night audit shift in complete darkness so it was a win for her. My manager was finally able to go home and same with me, and after that we got a crap ton of negative reviews because of the event but like I said, it was a situation we couldn't control.


Edit: This happened a while ago and I’ve since found a new job but I figured I’d share this story especially since it’s so confusing to me that the owner just sped off with his family to leave an associate and a manager to deal with the situation instead of himself.",28,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0BC4880>
316,Why is the price so high?,"I work at a hotel in a major airport. We’ve sold out often this year, and our rates are the rates. As a front desk agent we have no authority to change them. If somebody is nice I can apply the AAA rate, but most if these asshats are paying with their corporate card. I don’t care if your company will only authorize $200/night. If you don’t like the rate then stay at an off site hotel for less. 

When they ask I always say it’s supply and demand. I don’t set the rates, and it’s not like I’m going to say anything to disparage the fact we get a decent wage at our property.

318,"I had to call an ambulance for a drug addict, now she's back 1.5 years later","I'm on mobile so sorry about any formatting issues, and English is not my mother tongue so sorry for any spelling/grammar errors.

So, this story began a year and a half ago.

We had two drug users staying at the hotel (we're cheap and central so it's not at all unusual). They weren't awful, didn't wander the hallways half-naked, argue loudly, tear apart the room looking for imaginary bugs or refuse to pay, so they were already better than most and we decided to let them stay.

However, on the day of check-out they were late. I arrived four hours after they were supposed to have checked out, and they weren't out yet. It was a busy day so we just went up and told them they had to leave a couple of times, but they were always very agreeable and promised to be out soon, so we let them be without calling security.

Bad idea.

Five and a half hours after they were supposed to have checked out, we (me and my coworker) went upstairs to give them a final warning. The guy rushed past us down the stairs saying he was going to kill some guy, then ran out the door. 

We rushed up to the room to find the woman heavily drugged, and getting less and less coherent. After arguing with the emergency services for a while, she stopped responding and they finally agreed to send an ambulance.

My coworker had to go down to the front door to guide the ambulance workers to the room, and I stayed behind to make sure she kept breathing. 

I noticed that when she lay on her back, her breathing became strange and uneven, and I was terrified she'd stop breathing. But because of how she lay on the bed and how heavy an unconscious person is I couldn't put her on her side, so I had to brace against the bed and pull her over to her side, trying to be as gentle as possible, then hold her there. (Maybe I could have done it some other way but honestly I was so stressed (anxiety) that it was all I could think to do.)

I spent half the time listening and watching for her breathing, and the other half staring out the window hoping the ambulance would arrive soon. It must have been less than ten minutes, but it felt like at least an hour.

When they did arrive I was so relieved. My hands and arms were shaking, partly from the exhaustion and partly nerves. They took her with them, and she came back the next day to collect her stuff so clearly things went well. The guy explained that she had been forcibly drugged by someone, but after having worked here too long I know not to take anything they say at face value.

Today, she checked in again, one and a half years later. I honestly didn't recognize her at first, and I don't think she recognized me. If I'd known I never would have checked her in, but now she's here, and my hands are shaking. I don't think I can do a repeat of last time. (She did seem drugged, but said something about some handicap so I thought it was some disorder that messed with her body and speech, which is why I checked her in.)

At least she's not with the guy she was with last time, so here's hoping it will go better this time!",68,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0BC49A0>

She gave me a piece of paper that was all the information on it which is fine except for the fact that the piece of paper shows that she was supposed to stay here last month instead of this month. So I explained that to her expecting........ resistance.

However lo and behold she and her group were understanding. They asked if I had a room and I went looking while they huddled together trying to figure out what to do. We were at nearly 100% capacity so I wasn't sure if I can get them room to fit their needs. It didn't help that the system was lying to me. We had one empty room that would have fit their needs, and in one part of the system it was showing that it was clean and unoccupied, however in another part of the system it said it was occupied and dirty so I sent security up to check it out and it was indeed clean and unoccupied but the system wouldn't let me check them in the way I usually would, I had to finagle it a little bit.

So I finally get them checked and then they're extremely grateful and I told them to come down in the morning to talk to the first shift to see what they could do about having them stay here.

So the next day I come in and I ask what had happened with the group and it turns out that reservations fucked up. The group was here for the right day, but reservations accidentally put it in for January instead of February. So obviously we found a way to keep them at the resort, refunded the deposit that we absconded with. And gave them that first night free, honoring the original, cheaper price for the rest of the rooms. 

And even more shockingly the woman and her group didn't get pissed off, they didn't get angry, they didn't start demanding things, they simply thanked the front desk for their help, and went about their vacation.

So obviously we couldn't let such nice people go unrewarded. So the GM set up a spa package for the group and dinner at our super fancy restaurant, to apologize for our MAJOR fuck up. Needless to say they were extremely happy. 

I wish more guests understood that you catch more flies with honey than with vinegar.",65,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0BC4A00>
320,Guest Complaint I Just Got," ""night audit guy came up to me and my friends around 1am because we were in the lobby asking us if we were going to go to sleep or what were our plans, with that being said we were not being disruptive or **running** through the **halls**. no reason to ever be asked that when we have **access** to the hotel 24/7 since we are paying **guests , and in fact members**. we were given vouchers but i feel like i deserve more then that.""

Huge shout out to this guest who was SLEEPING IN THE LOBBY that I asked to either go to bed, or just do something else. 

What front desk person goes out of their way to bother guests? You were sleeping in the lobby. Love it.",55,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0BC4A60>
321,My heart is as cold as our unheated pool,"We have a repeat guest - scraggly old lady- who just comes to the hotel for the outdoor pool.  She usually comes in the summer and tries to get in early and/or stay later (no, pool times are fixed and inflexible)  This particular morning she went when the pool opened at 8 AM.  It is February but warmer than normal here- about 70 degrees outside in the morning.  Now our pool isn't heated.  It never has been.  So when it is 70 outside, the pool is probably going to be around 70 as well.  She comes inside and complains that the pool is freezing.  I explain that is isn't heated, it never has been heated, and that when she came here in the summer and it was 90 by 7AM, the pool was warmer because the temperature outside was warmer.  When she tries to checkout later that morning she asks if she can come back to swim.  I say no, since you need a key to get access to the pool and since she isn't a guest anymore she won't have access to a key and we don't give out day passes.  She slams the keys on the desk and walks out the door. She later writes a review and mentions me by name saying how cold I am.  I had already written a report about her so I simply attached a note to corporate to check the file I had already made for her.",39,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0BC4AC0>
322,Tales of the Bellman: Unpredictable Tipping,"I had a solid six years as a bellman/valet, and since I’ve been out for some time (4.5 years), I figured some of these stories are now past the “privacy agreement,” so I’ll regale with a few tales. We’ll start with something positive.

****

I worked for a large resort in Florida that has a lot of beach view rooms, so we were a very popular spot for weekend vacations, romantic getaways, and families. We also sold a lot to conventions, whether they were large corporations that sold out the place, or 30-sum folks for a conference.

Most of the time, as a bellman, you can predict what your tip will be like depending on how the cart is filled. For example, if a person brings a couple large bags/suitcases and maybe a hanging item, it’s about $5-$10, same with a cart filled to the brim but some things packed with plastic bags. Usually a $20 bill was tied to the heavy amount of luggage, but families really only applied that to the $1 per bag rule. Personality came into play a lot - if the guest likes you, they’d take care of you. Those were always cool.

My favorite tip moment: one of our competitors was about three miles down the road, and they had a restaurant EVERYONE used to fight over reservations for. One night, it’s slow and we have a hefty staff. These three guys dressed business casual (jackets, no ties, slacks or jeans) come to the drive and ask if one of us could give them a lift to said restaurant.

I clear it with the boss, grab one of our house cars, and we take off.

When we’re in the car, we’re talking nonsense, football, and I get picked on for being a lifelong Giants fan. I get them to their destination, give them a callback number, the guy I spoke to the most slips me a bill and I take off.

I didn’t see what he gave me, just pocketed it to be polite, so when I got about halfway down the road, I pull out the bill and almost wreck the car - dude slipped me a $100 bill.

My brain goes to “Maybe he meant to give me a $10 and grabbed this by mistake,” so I mentally prepare for that conversation for when I go grab the lot. It’s happened before with a $5 and a $50, so it’s fine. A ten minute ride warrants something smaller, no big deal.

I get the call about two hours later, slide over to grab them. 

When they get into the house car, they’re talking about the Mayweather vs. Pacquiao fight and the Kentucky Derby (it was around the same time). The same guy who gave me the first bill goes “Yeah, I’m going to the derby, then I think I’ll hop over to Vegas for the fight.”

So now I know that he gave it to me purposely, and he’s about to give me another one, which he did.

Two nights later, same thing occurred, same guys, same amounts. I also got an additional $100 when I belled him out.

Sometimes, you really have no idea what you’ll get from these folks.",16,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0BC4B20>
323,"""So long, farewell, Aufwiedersehn, goodbye."" AKA I put in my notice! + pool debacles","As the title states, I put in my two weeks notice. I've been working in the hotel industry since 2015, and the past two years have been hell. From being laid off for 13 months, to how much more high maintenance guests are today, I'm burnt out and ready for a change. I don't know if it's like this everywhere else, but in my city all the hotels are the same; shitty Management that takes advantage of good workers, when there's issues with co-workers it gets swept under the rug and hardly ever addressed, and if it is it's sent as a mass email to everyone (i.e ""Just a friendly reminder that debit payments are posted with a negative! If anyone needs help please let us know!"")

This post is now 3 days in the making because we were swamped all day and night Friday and Saturday.

The hotel has been pretty dead since before Christmas. Out of nowhere, the hotel is practically full this weekend. And of course we weren't scheduled accordingly. We've been 1 per shift for a while now, which has worked fairly well up until Friday. We have a small parking lot, which doesn't have enough spaces for 133 rooms anyway, and it doesn't help that the restaurant that rents space from the hotel (no affiliation to the hotel. Can't charge to your room, they don't deliver to hotel guests anymore, can't access the restaurant from inside the hotel) has their guests park in our lot, and 99% of the time they don't come to pay for the parking. So they take up space for our actual guests. At least no one screamed in my face tonight when I gave them alternative parking like people have done in the past, so yay?

The pool. The dreaded pool. For a while now, we've been doing reservations for the pool, because only one family/room is allowed in at a time. The slots are for half an hour, but since it's been so slow up until now, as long as there wasn't another reservation after, the family could stay for an hour if they wanted. There was a couple mix ups Saturday night. A couple showed up at 8, and there was a different room number in that slot. At the same time I was dealing with finding parking for someone, so I called the room that was reserved to make sure we had the right time for them, and the guy said that the kids would be down. I was running around like a chicken with my head cut off for maybe 10 minutes between the parking lot and people in the lobby, and the family that had the time slot called and cancelled. The couple had left the lobby and I couldn't remember what room they were. I called the room that I thought it was, and it turned out to be the adjoining room with them. I heard the couple open their door, the person on the phone said they could go now if they wanted but they declined. Probably all pissy pants because of the mix up.

Then it happened again tonight. Grandparents show up with their grandson at 4. I went to bring them to open the door and there was someone in there. It was the girlfriend of my friend who is staying here, so I just said that someone else was booked for 4 o clock. She said that she only came in at 3:40, and that the other FDA said she could stay until 4:30. There must have been a miscommunication because the 4 o clock slot was already booked before she went in. I told R (the gf) that from here on out we would only be doing slots of half an hour, because the pool is getting busier and to avoid these situations. Of course she was understanding about it, the other people? Not as much.

I'm hoping the next 2 weeks go by smoothly and without issue. Day shift usually isn't as bad. But in case I don't get any more tales, thank you to everyone in this sub for your stories and advice over the years, it's really helped me in some situations at work. I'll still be lurking around though, because hotel guests be crazy.",17,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0BC4B80>
324,I gotta try to figure out what's going on in Afghanistan.,"So I'm working the front desk at a hotel, if you can believe that. It's near the end of a shift I was working where I both had to clean up breakfast and run back and forth to the desk helping people and answering the phone because our breakfast/front desk agent/driver got injured. I was kind of wrapped up in my own shit.

Anyway, a few weeks ago I was informed that our hotel ""won"" a contract to host some Afghan refugees. They've been great except for one person we had to kick out for being fresh with a housekeeper, they got relocated. 

Sometimes they come and talk to us, we got one pretty damn fluent in English and some barely, most not. I know the fluent guy but don't know who else. At one point one of them shows me some newspaper articles on his phone and it's all written to me in a squiggle language I can't make heads or tails of and I'm just kind of like ""I don't... get it."" After a little while he's like ""that's okay"" and moves on.

So now for mae culpa. A guy that's semi fluent in English starts trying to talk to me about how fucked up it is in Afghanistan and I'm just kind of thinking man I'm not going to be able to have this conversation, so I'm kind of dismissively like ""yeah, it sounds pretty rough."" After a few volley's he says ""well, sorry to bother you"" and I'm like ""oh it's okay! I'm sure... it's rough."" I'm still wrapped up in my own shit but I start thinking about my troubles and there's and it's like that moment from those old Looney Tunes cartoons where they superimpose the image of a sign that says ""jack-ass"" over the characters face and plays *honk hank hoonk hank* with a donkey making its noise. 

So I want to try to figure out what their situation is better I'm not a goddamn geo-political scientist. I know enough about geo-politics that if I just try to dive right in I'll be diving into an inky black ocean of bullshit. Maybe there's questions I could ask that would get me better situated to where there coming from and approach it from there. 

Anyway, that's the story.",28,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0BC4BE0>
325,Some people can’t exist without being insufferable,"The phone rings. I answer with my usualy greeting.

Me: yes, how can i help you?

Guest: i have a reservation arriving next week that i’d like to cancel.

326,They call him Fred.,"One night I checked a couple into 304. Not long after, they called me and said their sheets were wet. I was thoroughly confused and went upstairs to see what they were talking about. Housekeeping had been gone for hours. Even if the sheets weren't completely dry when they put them on the bed, it should probably be dry by now, right?

&#x200B;

I knock on the door, the woman answered and let me in. She led me to the bed and pulled back the duvet. Sure enough, there was a wet spot about 2 & 1/2 feet in diameter. It was freshly wet and seemed like it was caused by a decent amount of water. I looked at the ceiling above for evidence of a leak but the plaster was pristine. The duvet that was over the wet spot was completely dry as well. I made a note to ask housekeeping what happened to cause this. The only rational explanation I could come up with was a housekeeper spilled a bottle of water on the bed and left it like that. I moved the couple to a different room and thought I would hear the story eventually.

&#x200B;

I checked a few different people into 304 in the following weeks. Each time I had to move the guest to a different room, due to another wet spot or the heat not working. We sent maintenance to the room to investigate these complaints but he never came back with anything that could cause these things. I made it a point to stop putting people in the room. I would soon learn that these repeated instances weren't just a product of my overactive imagination.

&#x200B;

Our executive housekeeper was chatting with me at the desk and made a a joke in passing about the ghost in 304. I asked her why she thought so. She mentioned the wet sheets. No matter how many times they change them, the wet spot returns. Maintenance had been to that room, checked the HVAC system and the pipes above and below the room but there was nothing wrong with them. She also said that the lights will flicker sometimes when she and others were in the room. They named the ghost Fred, short for Alfred. The ghost was temperamental and didn't enjoy having company in his space, like a crotchety old man. So they gave him an old man's name.

&#x200B;

Whenever I have no choice but to put someone in the room, I get the same complaints. Maintenance gave up their search for a source. Management told the front desk team to rent that room last or not at all if it could be avoided. The hotel is only three years old but our city is said to be cursed by the natives that lived here. I try to look at things skeptically and feel secure thinking there's a logical, earthly cause to most of what is categorized as paranormal phenomena. But to this day, we haven't found one.",25,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0BC4CA0>
327,MY BEST FRIEND'S DAD SHOWED UP WITH AN *ACCOUNTANT*,"I don't even know where to begin here.

Last March I started a job at a new hotel (I've been working in hotels for a few years). This hotel has day reservations available for the purpose of travelers, seeing as we are right beside a major highway.

One day I'm perusing my day room check ins, making sure shit is done and all that and I notice a familiar name. The name of my best friend's dad.

I didn't honestly think it could be him, even if their last name is 'never-heard-it-anywhere-else' type of unique. I went on with my morning and got all my pre-arrivals ready. The day use rooms here don't show their credit cards because they're pre-paid and the incidentals are covered. They only need their I.D to collect their keys.

ANYWAYS

Some time later the automatic doors slide open and I look up from my book to see my best friend's dad saunter into the hotel. He's wearing a mask, it's COVID, but I would recognize this man anywhere. I've literally known him my entire life.

He walks up to me at the desk (I'm alone) and says his last name and hands me his I.D. Its at this point I realize HE HAS NO IDEA WHO TF I AM!?? I don't know how but I'm so stunned I don't even question it. I hand him his keys and he goes up to the room.

Now some backstory: This man works in town. Maybe ten minutes down the road from the hotel, and his house is a 20 minute drive away. Its far, but not far enough to warrant a day use room at noon on a Wednesday. He actually works at the same company as my dad, so I know that he has a work credit card and he's in a high enough position that he could dip out of work for an hour and no one would bat an eye. He's a father of 3, him and his wife have been together for 30 years, they're the picture perfect family. That one family everyone knows that are just always happy and doing everything right? That's them. Except for recently, when one of his kids started struggling with depression and the other (my best friend) has been battling a new disorder that's nearly taken her life a couple times. But despite those issues, their family seemed happy and strong.

Anyways back to the story.

So I'm sitting at the front desk just absolutely confused, digging through our hotel's reservation history to find out that he's stayed with us 6 other times in the past couple months. I try to rationalize it, like maybe he's just tired and wants to take a nap? He's going through a lot, right? But that's stupid. I just couldn't fathom another reason why he would be here, at a hotel, in the middle of the day. I wouldn't entertain the idea of there being a possibility of infidelity.

It's not long after that thought crosses my mind that the automatic doors open again and a young woman walks in. She's young, like college-age, maybe 20/21 years old.

I don't have anymore day use rooms and I know she isn't in-house, so I ask her if I can help her find anything.

She goes ""I'm looking for room 206""

I freeze.

I'm going to be sick.

That's the room I just gave to my best friend's dad.

I silently point towards the elevator and wait for her to make her way over to it before immediately running to the laundry room.

Its a small hotel, all the departments are close, the only other person I can tell currently folding fitted sheets.

I tell him what's going on and he's as stunned as I am, even if he doesn't know them. What the fuck, right? This is seriously messed up.

He waits with me at the desk for when their time in the room is up and he takes the burden of checking them out. I stand in the back with the CCTV cameras and wait until they're both out of the parking lot before my coworker and I run to the room they were just in.

I need evidence that I'm not literally going insane.

Lo and behold the bed sheets are a mess and there are two condom wrappers in the garbage.

At this point all I can do is go about the rest of my day and every once in a while ask my coworker what tf I'm suppose to do.

We signed a privacy agreement when we started working at the hotel, I can't just out him because I'll lose my job.

Throughout my time there, my best friend's dad came through another 5 times. The last time he came through he paused at check in and really got a good look at me.

I had resorted to trying to make my identity obvious by drawing attention to my name tag or having a coworker call the desk from the back so I can announce my name through the receiver. I figured this way if he figured out who I was and what I knew, maybe he would out himself and I wouldn't have to fight with myself over whether I should do it myself.

He seemed to have realized it was me that last time, and I never saw him at the hotel again.

The thing is, I don't work there anymore. I just recently got a better job at another hotel in the area.

What do I do? Do I keep it to myself and continue to feel fucking awkward and awful every time I see my best friend? Or do I tell them, consequences aside?

This is some crazy moral dilemma and I need advice ya'll. Help me out.

****
EDIT: I’ve been getting a lot of people saying that I’m a horrible person for being curious about his frequent visits. I never told my coworker about previous visits. I haven’t told another soul. I’m here for some genuine unbiased advice from people in the same industry. I haven’t made any decisions. Thank you to the people who are offering their honest advice without attacking me as a person. I’m only human, after all. I don’t think it’s fair I have to shoulder this burden that shouldn’t have been mine to begin with. I’m taking this seriously and will take it to the grave if I feel it’s best for those involved. 

All that aside. Thank you everyone for your advice.",220,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0BC4D00>
328,Thompson,"I had a guest walk into front desk and just say, ”Thompson.” 
Hello Mr. Thompson, how can I help you?
Checking in obviously. 
I said, “Ahh, good to know.” Considering I didn’t know what he wanted. 
He didn’t like that and asked for the manager. I went in the back and my manager came out and asked him what the problem was and he said that the staff should be trained better so they can properly anticipate the needs of the guests. 
Because my manager is awesome, she told him, “I apologize, but no amount of training can make him a mind reader.”
He was dumbfounded and she proceeded to check him into a not great room (we are a timeshare and don’t book by view, just size)
Once the checkin was done she walked past me, fist bump, and told me to tell him if (when) he came back to tell him it was all that was available. He came back 2 hours later and told me that he booked an ocean view (again, we don’t book by view) and demanded to speak to the manager again. 
She came out and told him that was the only 2 bedroom available but she would be happy to upgrade him to a 3 bedroom for a $50/night upgrade fee and a $150 cleaning fee since he was in the room for 2 hours. He refused the move and left.

We were sitting in the breakfast area bullshitting while I was killing time before the audit. 

I got up to go to the bathroom AND THEY FOLLOWED ME INTO THE BATHROOM

They guy started pulling my hair and the girl was like I don't think she's into this I think you should stop. 

Like yeah definitely not into it. I don't know you first off. Second I'm at work!

I mean don't get me wrong that could have been a cool fantasy if I was into that. But I'm not. 

So thanks but no thanks guyssss!

Edit: my boyfriend made friends with this couple when we got snowed in a couple weeks ago so I was more relaxed with them than I normally would have been.
They were really drunk so I'm chalking it up to poor choices that they hopefully will not repeat. They've been good the whole time otherwise.

330,No good deed goes unpunished.,"TL/DR is at bottom.  I am sleep deprived so as is customary I apologize for formatting, and spelling and... well everything.

So it is Valentine's day weekend, and the city where my hotel is, as well as the next city over, has multiple tournaments going on.  I am the GM of a small hotel near the southern House of Mouse.  Once again the owner has gone out of town, leaving me and one other front desk agent as the only people here.  I have been sold out, every. single. night. this week.  That is your context and here is my tale.  I shall be UB in this story, and and the guest shall be CM for Crazy Man.

I arrive at 1pm on Saturday to start my shift, I do not get off until sometime after 3pm on Sunday.  As I enter the lobby and go to clock in  I see a car pull up and let someone out, with apparently everything they own.  I clock in and go to the front desk.  CM walks in.

UB: Hello sir, how can I help you today.  
CM: Yes I have a reservation for today.  
UB: Ok I can verify that for you what is your name?  
CM: Crazy Man  
UB: Ok I do see your reservation, unfortunately normal check-in time is 3pm and I was sold out last night, so I don't think I have a room ready yet.  
CM: I stay at hotels all the time, and I can usually get in a little early.  That's crazy man, are you sure you don't have anything.  
UB: (I feel bad for the guy because he has a ton of stuff and an apparent toothache as he is asking me about using teabags to relieve such an ache).   Give me a few minutes and let me see what I can do.

I walk around the hotel and talk to the housekeeper on duty, the only one I have, because who doesn't need help these days?  She hasn't even gotten close to the room CM is supposed to go into, but she has finished some.  I get a list and head back to the lobby.

UB: Ok your room isn't ready, but let me see if I can't move some people around and get you into a room.  There are multiple tournaments going on and it's Valentine's day weekend, so I can't promise anything.  
CM: Yeah you do what you can, it would be crazy man if you can't get me in early.  
UB: Alright I got you set, I see you are staying on rewards, however I do need a credit card on file just for damages.  
CM: I've never had to do that before, that's crazy man.  
UB: Each hotel is different, if you don't smoke in the room or throw a tv through the window you'll be alright  
CM: Alright here is my card, but that's crazy man, I've never done that before.

Roughly two hours later CM is back in the lobby.  He is looking for change for our soda machine as it currently isn't accepting dollar bills, and did you know that it's ""crazy man"" that a machine is busted.  
Another two hours and he is up front getting change for the pizza delivery guy, and did you know that it's crazy man that it's going to take 45 minutes for his pizza to be delivered.

Finally  just after midnight, my last arrival shows up.  I shut the lobby lights off, and lock the door, and head to the room that I have blocked for me to grab a few hours sleep before I have to be back at 6.  
But of course I have random people who will ring the doorbell asking for a room, disregarding the 4 signs that say I'm sold out. And therefore I get broken sleep at best.  At 4:45 AM the doorbell rings, and it is CM.

I answer via the doorbell connection.  
CM: Yeah I stepped out of my room for just a second and forgot my key and now I'm locked out.  
UB: Ok give me two minutes and I'll be right there.  
I get there and make him a key and hand it over.  
CM: I've never been at a hotel that doesn't have someone in the lobby at all times, that's.  
UB: Crazy man, yeah I know, we do things different.  Have a good rest of the night.

And with that it is now time to run audit, and there is no point in me trying to go back to sleep. Check out is at 11.  At 10AM CM walks into the lobby.

CM: Where is breakfast?  
UB: I currently do not have a breakfast, we have coffee available right here though  
CM: No breakfast that's crazy man.  I'm trying to extend my stay, but I don't have any more points, what is your rate.  
UB: For tonight it is $100  
CM: I saw that online, why is it so high?  
UB: There are multiple things going on locally and I'm almost out of rooms, I told you that yesterday when you asked for an early check in.  
CM: The hotel 30 miles and 5 cities away is cheaper. You should match them.  
UB: I'm a better hotel than they are, and I'm currently busy.  
CM:  That's crazy man.  You need to lower your rate.  
UB: That's the lowest rate I have, using the AAA discount that I will give you regardless of if you have it.  
CM: Nope that's too much, if you won't lower your rate I'm going to need a late check out. I should be out around 2pm  
UB: I can't offer you that late.  The owner doesn't want any late checkouts and I'm busy, as I've stated.  
CM: That's crazy man, why are you busy?  Every other hotel gives me a late check out.

At this point I'm done with Crazy Man, I've had very little sleep and my wife called me earlier to let me know that I have a plumbing issue going on at home that requires my family to go elsewhere.... yay.

UB: Check out is at 11, if you have not remitted payment to extend your stay by that time you must vacate the room.  I don't care if you want to bring your stuff to the lobby while you wait for a ride, but you have to be out of that room.  
CM:  So not even 5 minutes... that's  
UB: I get it that's crazy man, but that's how it's going to be.  

He was out of the room by 5 minutes after checkout time, and told me that he would never stay here again.  I can not tell you how thrilled I am to hear that.  Can't wait until my front desk person arrives so I can get a little sleep.

331,Boring Hotel,"I have a guest write a review saying that the hotel was boring. He works for one of the biggest companies we do business for. My job is to reply to the comments. I told him I am sorry that you felt that the hotel was boring and then listed all the amenities for the hotel and the surrounding areas. He wrote back that he wanted a refund for the legitimate complaints. WTF!!! I know that we are in an area with not a lot to do. The hotel is located in a small industrial town. However, we are close to a lot of major attractions. We are also less than 1 hour away from 3 big cities. Gotta love entitled assholes nowadays. I'm not sure what he was looking for.

332,Front Desk Noir,"It was a night like most Saturday nights in this city.  The streets were choked with the cars of Jill and Jack College Student, galivanting about, looking for a place to slake their thirst or fill that rumbling in their belly.

But I wasn't worried about their affairs.  Sitting in my chair behind the front desk, our bar closed and food service no longer available, I was safe and peaceful, free to work on getting some paperwork done, or, more likely watch some videos on Youtube while thinking about how I wanted to write the ""trailer"" for my upcoming Pathfinder campaign.

I knew that dame was trouble when she walked through the front door.   Five foot six, wearing dark clothes and an expression that said, ""I'm going to ask you to do something, and not going to take no for an answer.  Not without speaking to a manager first, anyway.""

""Evening, Ma'am,"" I said, a slight Texas twang to my greeting, like a sheriff in some dusty town long forgot to time.  ""How may I assist you this fine evening?""

""I have a reservation for a room with a king bed,"" she said.  ""And I need to pay cash at check in.""

See, like I said.  I knew she'd be trouble.

""I'm sorry, but unfortunately, cash at check in is not an option.  I need a valid credit card.""

""But I bank with a credit union and we're from out of town, so we have to wait for another credit union to open in the morning to be able to put this money in our account.  Is there nothing you can do?  Can you at least call your manager?  I'm sure they'll approve it.  We are, after all, Shiny Level 2 members.""

Ah, yes, Shiny Level 2 members.  You know the type.  Sooner kick you off a cliff than risk not getting their free check in water.  ""Sorry, Ma'am, but I've already had this conversation with my manager, and their answer will be the same.  And since it's well past eleven, I'm not waking anyone up just to get the same answer.""

""There's nothing you can do for us?""

""Well, if you can find other accommodations that will accept cash, I'm willing to cancel your reservation with no charge, since it's less than an hour old.""

She gave me that look.  You know the one.  The one filled with incredulity that you dare defy her, but also containing the resignation that she isn't getting her way.  ""I will speak with my husband in the car.""

She walked back out my front door, taking that dark cloud with her, and I breathed a sigh of relief.  After a few moments, they drove off, and I cancelled their reservation, considering myself lucky that they'd wandered off.

Old Joe from security - he's neither old, nor named Joe, so I'm not sure why we call him that - comes back in from his rounds.  ""So, that guest just asked me to use my card for their room, and they'd MoneyApp me the cash,"" he said with a laugh.  Obviously, he'd said no.  So we had a chuckle.

But some guests, you can't get rid of so easy.  They just keep turning up, like a bad penny.  I guess that's why I wasn't so surprised when I saw a familiar truck pull up in our lot, and a familiar brunette stride through our doors.

""I was able to find a credit union ATM and put in my money.  So our card has enough funds now.""

I'd be lying if I told you that I was happy with that news.  But these are hard times, so sometimes even a night auditor has to take in clients he doesn't want.  It's either that or you don't eat.  So I proceeded to begin the check-in process.

""I just need your government ID to confirm the government rate,"" I said.  And before she even answered, I knew this one was gonna end up as a tale I told.  The eyes are everything.  If you learn to read them, you know what's coming.

""Well, you see, our truck was broken into, and they took my husband's government ID.""

""Unfortunately, Ma'am, I cannot check you in at the government rate without that ID.  It would be against our policies, and a violation of our relationship with the government.""  I already knew what she would say next.

""Can you call a Manager to ask?""  

""Once again, Ma'am, I've already had this particular conversation with my manager.  There's no way they'll approve it.""

""But my husband's a pastor, you can't cut us a break?""

I sighed internally.  Men of the cloth are a bit of a soft spot for me.  I wanted to help them.  But I couldn't budge on this.  ""I'm sorry.  I can't extend the Government rate without a valid government ID.  But I have a little leeway with other discounts.  Let me take a look and see what I can do there.""  I found that the auto club rate would save them a Jackson on the rack rate, and I had a loophole for that one.  ""I've found a discount that will save you twenty bucks.  I just need to see an auto club card to authorize it.  And there's one here.""  I put my wallet away, smirking at my abuse of the rules.

""I'll probably have to go by the ATM again, so let me talk to my husband.""

She sauntered out into the night, and a few minutes later, the man of the cloth entered.  I knew who he was immediately, as he had that Friar Tuck look to him.  Not the sackcloth robe, of course.  I mean the girth.  I begin to greet him, but he cuts me off.

""My wife tells me you can't do the government rate without a government ID?  But it was your central reservations that told us to use the government rate, since we're tax exempt, and that comes out to about the same cost as the normal rate at tax exempt.""

""Sir, I don't know who told you that, but it's unfortunately patently false.""

""Well, then, I'll get my tax exempt paperwork and you can put us in at the rate you offered my wife.  It should be similar in price at least.""

I felt like one of those early Roman Christians, about to martyr myself via lion, but I had to inform him of an unfortunate fact, and holding back would not make my death any less painful.  ""I'm sorry, Sir, but unfortunately, our state doesn't do tax exempt for non-tangible goods like hotel stays.""

We went back and forth over that one for a bit, and spun our wheels over the government rate for what seemed like four boring innings worth of a bad baseball game, but what was more likely only five minutes.

""And there's no way you can give us the government rate?""

""None whatsoever, unless you can produce a valid government ID.""

""Well, then I guess I'm going to have to go tell my wife and our five kids that we're going to have to sleep in the car tonight.""

""Sorry to hear that, sir.  Have yourself a great night.""  After I spoke, he left into the darkness of the college town night once more.

But, as all things terrible, one entitled customer follows another, so perhaps one day I shall regale you with the tale of the man who wanted compensation because I cannot turn off the building ventilation system which was apparently drying out his nose, or the other man, who was pretty angry that alcohol sales end at midnight.

But those are tales for another night and I have a date with a dame whose first name is ""Haagen"" and whose last name is ""Vanilla"".

333,"No, boning someone in the military does not qualify you for our military rate","A woman came in for a walk-in and asked for a military rate. I went over the three rates we offer to guests who are in the military (most of our clientele are military or mil contractors), and asked for her military ID. 

She said she didn’t have one because her FWB is the one in the military. I told her that was fine, he would just need to be the one to check in and pay for the room. 

She then said he won’t be staying in the room with her, but that he could text her a picture of his ID. I fought the urge to laugh in her face and told her that not only would she still not qualify, her FWB could get in deeeeeep shit for taking a photo of his military ID and sending it to her. 

What followed was the most childish and embarrassing display of discontent I have ever seen. Like, I’ve not ever seen an outburst like this from my 9 year old step-son, let alone a grown ass woman. Crying, pouting, “let me speak to a manager” (hey, that’s me!), you name it. 

As an added bonus, she also asked to use her reward points for a free night stay. She was not a member of our rewards program or anything, she just thought those were the magic words. 

I never thought I’d meet an entitled dependa-in-training, but here we are.

336,A hookup that causes two employees to get fired,"Buckle up, this is a long, crazy ride.

The players
Me-me
Guest-big guy
Fd male employee-Sam
Housekeeper-Janet

Sold out night with one room out of order.

This started last night about 130 am.  I had the big guy come up to me asking if Sam was still here. I said no, he had left several hours ago.  I asked if I could help, the big guy said he had a question for Sam.  

I asked what was wrong,  he said he had felt uncomfortable with Sam. That when he got off work around 1030 pm, he waved at Sam and Sam ended up following him onto the elevator.  Sam had made a sexually suggestive comment to him while on the elevator. I took the information and called my boss. She said she would look at the cameras in the morning. 

7 am comes around,  the big guy stops by the desk. I inform him that my boss knows and will be investigating what happened. Janet was at the desk looking to get her paycheck and a room for the night.  At that point I was on the phone with my boss, telling her the new information I got. She denied Janet a room due to almost being sold out for Friday night. 

My boss came in and discovered that Sam followed the big guy onto the elevator through the cameras. She also discovered that all night long Sam was going in and out the big guy's room while the guest was in it. 

She also discovered the room that was out of order last night was slept in, with a strong smell of marijuana. Looking on camera she found Janet and 7 of her friends stayed in the room. Sam gave Janet a key to the room and put the room out of order.

Looking at the previous nights Sam has worked, he has been giving Janet a free room. This week was the beginning of his 4 week here. Janet has been going into rooms with his help, taking the housekeeping keys to go into a room or deliberately not cleaning a room so she could use it later.

Both lost their jobs this afternoon due to a complaint because Sam couldn't keep his business in his pants. We don't know why the big guy complained; maybe embarrassment, maybe Sam wasn't a good lay, maybe he was looking for more service or he came up with an excuse on why he was looking for Sam at 130 in the morning. But we wouldn't have known about Janet's and Sam's stealing/using rooms without the complaint, which exploded into this huge problem/issue which cost both of them their jobs.",46,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0BC50A0>

338,But Google Says,"Hello all

Welcome back to the Legal Garden.  This tale is from 2013/14 shortly after I started.  At the time, our walk in rates ranged from $169-$219 depending on the time of year(those were the days- so few troublemakers).

I’m working night audit and I get a call asking what our rate is.

I inform the caller that it is (let’s say) $179.

The caller gets upset and says that Google is saying it is something ridiculously (for the time) low - like $89.

She asks if I can price match, and I tell her I can’t.

She continues to insist that Google is giving her the rate she is claiming.

I pull Google up, and even for the advanced reservations they advertise, the rate is still around our rate for the night.

I ask what site she is on, and she continues to say Google and demands a room.

I tell her I can’t giver her the rate she wants, but if she is able to book it that we will honor it.

This continues with her questioning why, while I continue to repeat that she will need to book the room herself if she wants that specific rate.

After she questions why I won’t help her, she eventually hangs up.

I search Google for our hotel, and after a couple pages, I find an out of date local business/tourist/local website advertising the hotel at the rate she wanted.

A couple days later, our hotel received a review that simply mentioned how we had rude staff and that the reviewer wouldn’t stay here.",24,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0BC5160>
339,I told you how to use the elevator 3 times,"So, I get that sometimes technology can be confusing to people, but its not super hard. Occasionally, people will forget or it won't register, but most people don't get angry at me or anything; they're apologetic. 

We're built onto a parking garage... you can get to all 3 levels of the parking garage and the lobby without a key card, but the floors above, with the majority of our guest rooms, require you to access with your key. This is fairly common to my knowledge, but a rather new thing. 

When I check people in, I explain that there is a card reader right above the numbers, you hold the card up to it and the light green, then you can push your floor number. Without the card, the elevator remains on the original floor. 

I had a guest this afternoon keep pressing the number aggressively and the door kept coming open. I asked if he needed help and he asked if our elevator was broken. I explained how to use it again, he said thank you, but continued the same behavior. This would have been the second time I told him. 

""Why isn't the elevator moving?!""

""Because you need to use to use your key on the card reader. Do you want me to come show you?"" He declines, gets off the elevator and waits for the door to close, tries to call the elevator again and gets mad its the same one. 

I walk over, ask again if he wants help, he again declines. After a few more minutes of him cussing at the elevator and just being annoying, I walk over with a FOB, go to elevator, point to the card reader and say ""you need to put your key here, see, the light turns green, then you press your floor."" I asked the floor, he told me, and I press it. He said ""you could have just told me."" 

I told you once when you checked in and 2 or 3 more times while you were fighting with the elevator. WTF.",41,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0BC51C0>
340,A guy just threatend me over a mask,"*This just happened to me. A guy walks in with a mischievous grin (Sorry, that song’s been stuck in my head for a week now) but, more importantly, without a mask.*

*“Guy” will be the guy, “Me” will be a Magical Entity. Or maybe it’s just me.*

Me: “Excuse me, do you have a mask?”

Guy (*smugly*): “I don’t need one. I’m not a hotel guest, I’m just here to visit the hairdresser.”

Me: (*dying a little on the inside*): “I’m sorry but since you will be walking through our hotel, we need you to put on a mask.”

Guy: “I don’t need to put on a mask, I have a letter from my doctor that says I don’t need to.”

Me: “In that case, I need to see that letter, please.

Guy: (*triumphantly*): “You can’t! It contains medical information about me! I’m not sharing that with you!”

Me: “I’m sorry sir but if you don’t provide proof that you’re an exception from the rule, you need to put on a mask. I have one right here if you need one, complimentary of course.”

*Guy sighs and gets out a sheet of paper, holding his hand in front of it so I can’t see a thing. I somehow manage to not roll my eyes at this and ignore the fact that I would need to see both his name, the doctors’ signature and some ID and just nod. They’re not paying me enough to try and spot a fake, I decide.*

Me: “Thank you.”

Guy: “You’re welcome. Now remember” (*suddenly gets quiet*) “you always meet twice in a lifetime.”

*That last sentence is a common threat in German. I don’t know how to better translate it, but the intended meaning is “Next time I see you, you’re done for.” With that, guy leaves. And now I’m sitting here, hoping the nighty will escort me, a grown adult, to my car once my shift ends.*

*Anyway, what’s your worst “You have to wear a mask” story?*



*Update:* Thanks for all your comments. You're right I probably should have called the cops while he still was on property, but he wasn't there when I asked the hairdresser so he snuck past me when I was busy. Anyway, we got his name blacklisted so he's not coming back anytime soon. Also yes, night audit did escort me to my car, but he wasn't waiting for me.

341,Why are all these grown a** people still acting this childish over masks,"We are about 2 years into the pandemic. TWO. FUCKING. YEARS. I get it we are tired of wearing the facemasks but after 2 years this shit is now the new normal. The facemask is now (has been for a while) part of the wardrobe. 

At the beginning of the pandemic was the absolute worse. I dont want to speak for everyone but I was legit scared of getting covid. As soon as the mask mandate hit I strapped that shit up asap. I would have to ""lock"" people out that refused to wear masks and only let them in if they put one on. Got cussed at for telling people to wear a mask. Had guests that refused to wear a mask in the lobby and we would have to threaten to kick them out. I think alot of our DNR list from the past 3 years is mostly people that refused to wear masks. Literally made me want to quit it got so bad. I come to work to work not get verbally assaulted by ""guests."" We had free masks to give out and would have to threaten to cancel their room or not check them in for not putting the one I gave to them on.

Its been a while sense I have had these ""mask babies."" For some reason we are getting more and more of them. They come to check in, walk past the sign that says ""mask required"" and act like total tools when I ask for them to put one on. 

A very common scenario:

""Hey do you have a face mask""

""No. >:( ""

""Okay, I have one for you""

I give them the face mask and they don't put it on. They only put it on after I threaten that I wont check them in without one. 

I don't understand. I feel like they are trying to do this weird fucked up ""power play"" but I aint playing that shit. Put the mask on, follow our (and the states) policies or gtfo its not that hard to understand. Follow the rules or leave. I would expect this shit from kids but not grown ass FUCKING adults. Covid has really made me rethink if I ever want to work in customer service again. Customer Service has always had the typical few bad guests or customers but the good ones (genuinely nice ones) out weigh the assholes. With covid the ratio has been fucked.

Edit: Wow this blew up. I only use reddit at work so unfortunently couldnt reply to everyone but I am glad to see yall replying to eachother and shit.

342,Hotels Rates,"This just happen to me a while ago. I don't know if anyone has also experience this. Also it's a bit of  a rant.

So two old couples came in. I greeted them and ask if they have a reservation. They said 'no' and are looking for a room. They said that it was for one night, but they might extend tomorrow if something happens to their schedule. I was fine with it since we do have those guest that will extend their stay another day so I told them the rate which was $129 (before tax) and ask if they have the usual AAA/AARP/membership.

The guy said ""Oh, but it's different from the rate online. It says that it's $97 (also before tax).""

I already had a vibe that the guy is cheapskate. But I just let it be, so I ask if they could show me where they found the rate. They should me a google search of the hotels in the area with the filter showing lowest to highest rate. Red flag\*

I told them. ""That's actually not our property, but a different hotel. It's not to far from here actually."" I pointed at their screen and I also gave them directions if they wanted to go there instead.

Then the guy said, ""Why are you shooing away us, ***your potential customers***? Can't you just match the price here"" As he was, shoving the phone to the plastic divider as if that could make the rate go lower.

SMH.... In my mind, The rate isn't like that because the system generated it out of thin air. The rate is like that because you are not paying only for the room, but for a lot of things, it pays for the hotels amenities (bathroom amenities, the free teas or coffees in the room, complimentary breakfast & wifi), our services, the housekeeper whose going to clean the room after you check-out and taxes too. And I wasn't 'shooing away potential customers.' I was giving you directions to the hotel with the price that you wanted. Since that was what you where looking and not this hotel. Our hotel doesn't price match, but to those whose working at a hotel/s that does, Kudos to you guys. It must be a pain to deal with this kind of people.

IRL, I told him, ""I'm sorry, sir. But our property doesn't price match. I only thought that since you were looking for that hotel that you might want to know the directions. I didn't mean to shoo you. I apologize if I might have offended you.""

He was still grouchy that I didn't give him the price that he wanted since he was mumbling something I didn't understand. He asked about the rate for AAA and I told him the rate which is 5% less. Then he shouted, "" Well that doesn't change a thing. It's just $5 less. This is a sham and I will never stay here. You just loss yourself potential customers!"" He left with his wife trailing behind him and not saying anything during my conversation with her husband.

In my mind, Well good, at least I won't be seeing you then.

I don't know if this is rude or I'm just stupid for doing it. As they were passing the 2nd door, I said ""Have a good night."" I don't know if the husband heard me, but the wife did turn around to look at me.

I've actually had this discussion before with flat-earth relatives and I'm not sure where our guest stands on all that but I don't want to get into a conspiracy/political discussion with a guest so I attempt to play it off.

Me: I'm not sure but it looks like an ordinary plane.

G: No, did you see how it took off straight up? A normal plane can't do that. It must be some type of military aircraft. Is there a military base near here?

Me: I've not heard of one if there is a base near here. The nearest military base I'm aware of is 200 miles away.

G: No, there must be one closer it's probably classified so you wouldn't have heard about it.

M: OK, I need to get back to the desk nice chatting with you.

I could have told him that due to the curvature of the earth and your position relative to the plane it can appear to be flying vertically. I told my flat-earth relatives that and they said I was brainwashed.",50,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0BC5340>
344,Coworkers make my last day... Interesting.,"A few years back I worked at a resort in a major tourist destination in the Food & Beverage department. There are three restaurants on site, so we would receive the food orders and deliver them to their respective restaurants. I had only been there for a few months when I received a call offering me a job in an industry I had been trying to get into for years, so, in goes my 2-weeks.

My manager was a super cool guy but was always swamped, so he hired me as his AM to help manage the other two guys. Lets call them Dumb & Dumber. Dumb was a nice guy. My only issue was that he liked to smoke a lot of weed. I don't care if people do, but maybe, just maybe, have a clear head for work? I found him a few times taking food from the storerooms to snack on. Dumber, on the other hand, was an angry person. A conversation with him was like getting blood from a stone and he'd yell at kitchen staff to make him lunch. I'd try to intervene or talk to our boss, but nothing ever got better. Dumb & Dumber did not get along. If Dumb was near the door, Dumber would bump into him intentionally as he left. 

In the week of my last day, I could see tensions rising between them, but nothing outright aggressive. My final day arrives and Dumb & Dumber are nowhere to be found. I get started on our daily tasks and see a pretty large order of food needs to get across the property NOW. I start loading everything up when D&D finally arrive. Dumber blows past me while Dumb offers to help. I tell Dumb about a few things that need to get done, so he and Dumber should do that while I finish this. Off he goes, and off I go to deliver the food.

30 minutes later I'm approaching our work area and hear what sounds like screaming. When the door opens, I see Dumber with his hand on Dumb's throat. I manage to separate them and tell Dumber to step outside until he can calm down while I checked to see if Dumb was okay (he was, as EMTs checked him out). Then I called my boss to our office to let him know of the situation. He comes running into our area and immediately starts making the calls to get Dumb checked out and report to higher management. Dumb explained that he accidentally bumped into Dumber, and before he could apologize he had a hand on his throat. He did manage to punch Dumber in the head once. Long story short, both were sent home for the day pending further investigation.

So, here I am, about 2 hours into my last shift, having to cover the work of three people. The FD had a few guests call asking what was going on since the screaming was so loud. But hey, my boss gave me a few beers on the way out. I suppose that makes up for it.

345,I Don't Want to Lose My Shit,"Today has been a really good day, and that's saying something. So, now that I have someone messing that up, I believe it's time for a rant session.

We'll call this woman Margarita (her real name *is* a drink, but not that one). Margarita made a reservation using her account rewards for 1 night. I did her the *favor* of allowing her to check in early several hours before check in time, because she said she had surgery to go to, and her babysitter was with her (blah blah blah). We had plenty of room available, so I thought, why not? She had a local address on her reservation, so she came right over as soon as I told her she could check in.

She goes to her room with her kids, and then comes right back, complaining about the room.

Margarita: Um...I thought I booked a two-bedroom suite?

Me: No....(double checking in system) you booked our One-Bedroom Suite with a queen sized bed.

Margarita: And ya'll don't have a bigger room I can upgrade to?

(in my head) \*-First of all, you're not a high enough tier to qualify for a complimentary room upgrade. Second of all, we don't have those available even if I *wanted* to give you one.-\*

Me: No ma'am, unfortunately we're sold out of our Two Bedroom Suites. (she rolls her eyes) I'm really sorry.

She goes to her room. This morning, I see she has a new reservation, same room type, at the regular rate of about $180. She's wanting to extend an additional night. So I call her room just to make sure she's wanting to keep the same room she's in or go to a different room.

Me: Good morning! This is \_\_\_\_\_\_ at the front desk. Just calling to ask, I see you have a new reservation coming in for today. Did you want to stay in the room you're in now or move to a different one?

Margarita: Is the other room bigger?

Me: No ma'am, it would be the same room type you booked.

Margarita: (scoffs) Then no, I'll stay in this room.

Me: Alrighty, I can keep you in your current room. Did you want to use the same card you provided for incidentals for this second night's charge, or did you want to use a different card?

Margarita: No, he'll be down with the card.

\*-""He""? Okay....=\*

Me: Okay, I can change the payment on file when someone comes down for it.

So I see her maybe 30 minutes later standing at the desk with her kids. Like literally standing *at* the desk with her hand on it like she's waiting on me. I go out there, and because I know what she looks like, I don't bother asking her name or anything.

Me: Good morning! Did you want to go ahead and put your card on file?

Margarita: (as if I'm bothering her) Um, he's coming in with the card now.

She rolls her eyes again, snatches her one child by the hand while carrying the other and walks out. Right after she goes to this car out front, an older gentleman comes in eating cereal from our breakfast area.

Me: Good morning.

Him: Morning, I want to put a card on file for room \_\_\_\_\_ under \_\_\_\_\_

Me: Alrighty. I need your ID as well with your card. She has her reservation booked at the rate of $180.

Him: That's fine. (eats his cereal while I'm putting the card on file and checking ID)

I give him the receipt and send him on his way with it. Not 10 minutes later after they're gone, she's calling front desk. *UPSET* as hell, wondering why I charged him a higher rate than what she booked online. I look at the reservation, and see she'd booked it previously at the government rate per diem and it had been changed by Night Audit to the rate of $180. I can only assume it's because she came to inquire about it last night and was already asked for her Government Rate ID, and she didn't have one. Night Audit is asleep at this time, I'm sure, so even if I wanted to bother her to ask why she changed it, it would take forever to get a response back.

Me: I'm so sorry, it looks like the rate was changed last night. I'm not sure why it was changed at the moment. Do you have an Active Duty Government ID?

Margarita: Yeah, I have a \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  Bank Card!

Me: Okay, but you need your actual Government Rate ID, not the bank card. (that you're not even paying with!) If you have your ID, I'd be more than happy to change the rate back to the Government Per Diem.

Margarita: I *have* my credentials. I'll be stopping by later and you *will* be giving me a refund.

Me: No pro---- \*she hangs up in my face\*

Now I sit in the back office and patiently await Miss Margarita. I will be as nice as I can be, in the hopes that I can be a better me and not stoop down to anyone's level. It's my favorite past time, giving someone a taste of their own medicine, but I have been trying to do better.

Don't you just love people?

&#x200B;

\*UPDATE\* : She left this afternoon without a word to me about any form of ID. She approached me this morning to inquire about getting a late check out, and then left and never approached me again about the Government Rate or this ""ID"" she claimed to have. I've made a note on her reservation in case she tries to call back and claim she should have been changed. ",92,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0BC5400>
346,I think I scared her pretty badly.,"I'm not in the trade, but this is about a time I scared a front desk Lady. 

A number of years ago,  my wife was having an operation.  I had to stay at a hotel overnight.  I had a monster day of stressing about the op, and got to the hotel pretty late. I somehow managed to find a parking spot right out the front and went in to ask if it was OK to park there. Being tired and not really with it, I walked into the pokies (poker machines area) and up to the service desk.  I had a small overnight bag with me and without even thinking,  I put it up on the counter.  I saw the ladies eyes bulge,  I guess she thought I was going to try and rob her. A second later I realised what happened and told her that I had in fact,  come in peace.  Dunno if it's as bad as my recollection,  but I learnt that actions are important when dealing with high stress  area staff.",8,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0BC5460>
347,COVID conspiracy theories are not an appropriate sales pitch while representing one of the worlds largest hotel chains,"Hospitality veteran here, thought you guys would appreciate my recent experience. 

I had a pretty easy question concerning a future reservation, so I called the main 800 corporate number. After verifying my shiny Honors member account, I got transferred to the usual offshore call center. They promptly answered my question. At the end of the call, I was offered extra bonus points to listen to travel offers, and I said yes. 

I did this once before, years ago, but totally forgot that it’s not an automated recording, but a live sales person. I start to remember this before the sales person even gets on the line, and regret my decision. Just sitting around folding laundry, so decide to just continue anyway.

Greeted by an enthusiastic (US based) sales person whose voice and demeanor draws me in. Definitely good at their job. Go through the questions, which of these destinations sounds interesting, etc. I play along. The destination I say I have interest in is actually interesting to me, and the rate is actually compelling. 

I start to realistically consider the offer, but my upcoming year is a little too complicated, so I decline. For whatever reason the sales person’s response actually brings out a legitimate explanation from me. I lightly get into how I haven’t really been making travel plans for leisure the last two years, blah blah, etc. Mentioning “the last two years” is where I messed up.

That’s when the manifesto was laid out. Using the same pro-level bubbly sales voice, it was explained to me that it’s a fake virus, and that the government is behind this. I should not be scared, because that’s what the government wants. “We” need to get me out of my hiding place at home, and back into the world, because I shouldn’t be scared. The message was peppered in a few more times before the call was over. I tried to get out of there as graciously as possible. 

Honestly, it was so out of leftfield and unexpected, I was almost impressed. I couldn’t even appropriately respond, but maintained composure. Didn’t want to get into it with a stranger, or anyone really. I know these calls are recorded. I just couldn’t believe that someone would actually lay down “fake government virus” conspiracy theories while on the main corporate line with me, representing their multinational corporation. Especially on a call that’s linked to a specific member account. 

Can’t imagine how many other people have received this “corporate messaging”.",79,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0BC54C0>
348,No room for you,"I work at a 62 unit motel with a bar/restaurant. On slower evenings I work both the front desk and bar. The bar is directly off the front desk lobby so it’s easy to keep an eye and ear on both.

A few evenings ago I thought I heard someone in the lobby so I poked my head out the bar door into the lobby. I see a man standing at the front desk.

Now, I should mention, I always leave a large laminated paper on the front lobby check in counter which reads “For front desk service or to check-in, please go to the bar to your left.” This guy’s left hand was actually on the paper but apparently he is illiterate because as soon as he sees me he yells “I’ve been waiting 5 minutes for a room, b***h!”., before I even had a chance to say hello. 

Guess who didn’t get a room?",66,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0BC5520>
349,Late Check Outs,"This is going to be more of a rant than a tale, sorry. As most of you, we are understaffed. On top of that our sheets iron broke yesterday, and over 50% of our (on market) rooms need to be flipped.

Of course all of our guests want late check outs, we have none. Our in-house guests either want full stayover service (again, no way to press sheets) or to move rooms entirely. And NOBODY wants to respect my ""no"". Like literally both of my housekeeping supervisors will be helping with rooms today, and one of them was supposed to get a day off today.

Like why do people always set video call meetings that ""have to take place in a quiet spot"" for standard hotel check-out time? You know you're staying at a hotel, you ***KNOW*** you'll need to vacate by 11 am, so why are you scheduling quiet meetings after 9:30 am?? ""Sorry, I won't be available at that time, does another time work for you?"" Its not that hard!

Anyway the current supervisor on staff (who is also playing houseman this morning on top of supervisor and housekeeper) told me not to fall for the puppy dog eyes and I told her ""they don't realize that my name is \[misspelled feline\] and puppy dog eyes don't work on me"" and I mean after 3.5 years on audit they don't lol",64,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0BC5580>
350,"Nearby hotel was robbed, now I'm worried about our safety precautions","Hi all,

So over the weekend, another hotel of our same brand was robbed at gunpoint. I can't give out many details, but they injured the desk attendant and stole an ""undisclosed"" amount of money. This hotel is in the next big city over, about a 30 minute drive. 

Obviously, being 3rd shift, I'm freaking out. We have ""safety measures"" but not much. The door to get behind the desk does lock, so I always make sure it's locked on my shift. But that's it. We used to be able to lock the front door at night and people would have to pick up a phone receiver to be buzzed in, but the lock system was updated and I don't think the buzzer is compatible with the new system. And I'm not about to walk up to the door and open it for every person who needs to come in and out of the lobby all night. Also not sure if there's a card reader that would allow guest keys to unlock the door.

I'd get on management, but they don't do anything.

Obviously, in the event, everyone's advice is to just give them what they want, don't fight it. But is there anything else I can do to protect myself? I don't care about the hotel property, I'm just not trying to get killed on the job, ya know?",44,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0BC55E0>
351,Ridiculous taxi driver guest!,"I manage a small independent (57 room) hotel and we are the cheapest hotel in town. We also cater to long term stays. So we get a lot of needy, non adulting guests. 
We have a recent guest who decided to open a taxi service. First he expected me to make and print flyers for him. No, I pay for paper for THIS HOTEL not some other random new business. 
Then he wanted me to leave his flyers in our lobby, which at first I didn’t think was a bad idea, as it helps some of our non adulting or googling guests to not ask me to solve their non transportation for them. 
But then when a guest would take the flyer he wanted me to copy another. I did that one time and then decided to hang it so people could not take it so he couldn’t have that expectation of me. 
NOW I am getting phone calls to the hotel from people looking for the taxi! This business line is for THIS BUSINESS!

352,"I am NOT your babysitter, but I guess I'm not allowed to TELL you that.","We have a family in two rooms living with us, being paid for by their insurance, while their living situation is fixed from a house fire. There are several children, the youngest of which seems to be around 2. This morning, it was just the mom and the youngest in the lobby for breakfast. The child is left unattended for just about the entire time they were down there, but is mostly entertained by a nearby TV. The mom has a very relaxed parenting style and doesn't check on her kid but once in the span of 15 minutes or more, and the child is NOT within view of where the mom was at all. There is absolutely no way the mom could view her child from where she was sitting. The kid occasionally gets dangerously close to the front door (*lots* of vehicles going by at this point) but mom isn't paying attention. Eventually mom comes to get the kid and they leave for their room. 

I tell my supervisor about this and ask her what we're supposed to do, because these people are long term guests so it's not like we can just wait it out till they leave, and I know this will probably become a daily thing. I tell her I'm not a babysitter, and she agrees, that we aren't liable for her child and don't have to watch it, but also have no right to tell the mom how to parent. While I agree with everything she said, and I don't want to make the woman feel like we are telling her how to be a mother in any way, I still feel wrong about it. I asked, what if the child is running out the door, what do we do? She said to just tell them mom about it but she wouldn't go after the kid. I said, what if the child is ran over? I don't feel good about that knowing we could have had a conversation with the mom to try to prevent this sort of thing, but she just reiterated that we can't tell her how to parent.

 Later I went to the GM and she essentially said the exact same thing the supervisor said, and to ""use common sense"". But this still doesn't sit right with me. I kept pushing the issue. I asked specifically, where is the line here? When is it okay to get involved? Shouldn't we make it clear to the mom, in a way that isn't telling her how to parent, that we aren't going to watch her child? Because she seems quite comfortable letting her child wander with us being there at the desk, and I don't know if she knows that we aren't watching her child. After a bit when I wouldn't drop the issue, my GM said she'd go to her boss to ask about it, who is higher up in the company. My GM was probably quite annoyed with me by pushing this issue and in hindsight, I almost wish I hadn't said anything. I feel bad about making something out of nothing and bothering them with it, but I just felt so icky with the answer of ""Do nothing and let this child run off and maybe get hurt, it's not our problem."" 

I want to know what you guys think. Was I right in pushing for a direct answer in this? Or was I going too far and I should have just not said anything? What is a proper procedure in dealing with this issue that is within legal limitations and is respectful of the parent?",128,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0BC56A0>

354,Guest fakes having a service animal and pays for it,"The last hotel I worked at had a no pet policy but naturally allowed service animals. We had a guest check in with a small poodle claiming it was a service dog. Well next day after she checked out housekeeping found a nice brown 'present' left in the hall so we checked the security tapes to verify that it was her dog so we could charge her. What we saw was freaking hilarious. She had closed our bar down and was stumbling down the hall, dog following. She then proceeded to to pass out in the hallway just a couple of doors away from her room. Now this is where a real service animal would take action but noooooo. This little doggo walked away, took a deuce on the carpet and then *pissed on its passed out master!* Much laughter from us. We fast forwarded the tape to see what else happened.

355,"""It'S uNdEr My BoSs's NaMe""","*(Usual disclaimer, names are all aliases for anonymity purposes. Third-party booking site names are also modified, otherwise automod will zap this post.)*

So in comes a guest, Jenny Jiffpeg, who's here to check in. I go through the usual motion of asking for an ID and a cred or deb card, and the standard incidentals deposit disclaimer (hence why I ask for the card).

She goes and presents both an ID and a card, but I can't find her name in the arrivals.

""Oh, it's probably under my boss, Kyle Peengee.""

Sure enough I see a res for Kyle. But there's no res notes stating that Jenny is the authorized guest.

> **Jen:** He's in another city.
>
> **Rin:** Well, unless he's here and presents his ID, I cannot check you in under his res, this is part of our check-in policies.
>
> **Jen:** Ugh, just give me back my ID and card, thanks for wasting my time.

She storms off, and I'm sitting here trying to hold back the urge to scream obscenties at her. 

*But wait, there's more!*

The phone rings, and it's her boss Kyle. ~~Cue [boss music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6cSbof7Pik).~~

> **Rin:** Thank you for calling the Pineapple Pizza Motel, how may I help you?

The res was made through the third-party booking website Moping.com, so I pull up their extranet and go into the res details there to see if Kyle used Moping's messaging system to ask us to authorize Jenny to check in...negative.

> **Rin:** There's nothing in the res stating that Jen is allowed to check in for this res.

> **Kyle:** Well you know what, I've got a pissed off employee here now, I've stayed at your hotel many times, and I'm just never going to stay here ever again!

> **Rin:** I'm just--you know what, that's fine. We'll just cancel your res free of charge then. 
>
> **Kyle:** My card isn't gonna be charged, right?
>
> **Rin:** No. We haven't put any charges on your card, and we will not be charging it.

And he hangs up.

In hindsight, I probably could've informed Jen to please call Kyle and have him call me to authorize her to check in, but she stormed off before I really had the chance to do that. Alternatively, I could've asked Kyle when he called me to verify his identity by asking for his phone number or the last 4 digits of the card he used to book the res, then I could've added Jen's name to the res with his blessing. But by this point it was perhaps too late to really do any sort of damage control. Jen had ragequit her check-in, Kyle made his introduction by lacing his statements with anger and swear words, and even if I were to have Kyle authorize Jen to check in on his behalf, she certainly would not be interested in coming back because as far as she was concerned, I committed a capital offense by not checking her in without any sort of OK from Kyle.

Nonetheless, the takeaway here: **If you are booking a hotel room on behalf of someone else (such as an employee, your sibling, or your friend), put *their* name on the reservation, not your name.** If you put your name down and you're not going to be at the hotel for the check-in, or even in the same city, then it's just going to cause problems because any hotel that cares about the privacy and safety of its guests ain't gonna check someone in on behalf of someone else. Or, if you've already booked the res and there's no way to modify it or cancel it free of charge (with the intent of rebooking), get in touch with the hotel ASAP and ask them to authorize that person to check in, although do be prepared to possibly answer a few questions to verify your identity. Otherwise, it's not the hotel's fault that Charles Seevgee can't check in for a res under his boss Kate Buttmap's name.",31,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0BC57C0>
356,Behaving when a tour gets cancelled.,"Hope this is ok as it is not strictly hotel but a cruise front desk.

Was reminded of this recently when family were talking about my in laws. My (fil) father in law (rip) was an imposing man, solid 6 foot 4 and a very successful Aussie plumber, but with a really dry sense of humour. He also hated privileged wankers as he called them, as he used to have to deal with lots in his work.

He retired some years back when another plumbing firm paid lots for his business which had some very lucrative government contracts. 

So to celebrate in-laws booked themselves a big tour to the US, Alaska and Canada, which included a glacier cruise. 

Arrive at the cruise check in to be told that their cruise ship had hit an iceberg so was in for repairs. Choice was a refund or try to fit on a competitor ship.

An English couple ahead of the in laws were bitching and yelling about not good enough and they better get a good room. As they finally left both the poms and fd heard the fil muttering 'wingeing wankers' which horrified mil.

Mil told us that when they stepped forward to the desk the poor woman was looking concerned at this big bloke. She is about to start her explanation when he stops her saying 'I heard you before. So some idiot's getting his arse kicked cos our boat's stuffed. We've travelled from the other side of the world and are not coming back so don't want a refund. If you can get us on the other boat would be great thanks love. Don't care if it's in the bowels with no window as long as we can get somewhere to see the sights.'

She apparently looks very relieved, tells them she will see what she can do and sends them off to a lounge to wait for a bus. Bus comes and takes them to the other ship. Get taken around some corridors and open the door into a stateroom top of the decks on the corner. Floor to ceiling windows facing front and one side. Had a fantastic cruise of course.

Fun bit for them both was finding the wankers were down the bottom of the ship.",77,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0BC5820>

He's pretty well adapted by now, but every now and then he's got a cultural quirk.


So we're a business oriented hotel next to the city's convention center, leading us to get a lot of conferences. A few weeks ago, we had a group of prosecuting attorneys. They were great. Didn't leave messes, had their tax forms in order, didn't cause trouble. Ideal guests. I left a comment about that, because we could use a little positivity in our logs sometimes. Mr. Whiskers says that of course they were good guests, they're cops. LMAO. I correct him, these are lawyers, definitely not cops.


Well, now we have a full house of nothing but cops. They're belligerent, arguing about tax exemptions, yelling about how I AM THE STATE and all that. We're just rolling our eyes and sticking to the actual tax law as it's clearly written on the form they're arguing over.

358,Worst guest I have experienced so far,"Today I dealt with the worst guest in my almost 5 years in hospitality. Below is a copy and paste of the email I sent to the management team at my part time job, edited to provide anonymity to all involved. 

&#x200B;

Good evening,

&#x200B;

Mr. Shiny arrived at the property tonight around 4pm. I could not find his name,  and asked to check his confirmation email to make sure he was at the correct location. He took offense to this and started acting in a defensive manor but let me look at his phone. I thought when I looked at the email confirmation it said <Our property name> , but the confirmation number did not work. I apologized and set him up a room and let him know I would speak to <Brand> to get the situation resolved. Mr. Shiny remained irate through this, and kept making comments on how ridiculous the situation was, and how he would never come back to this hotel. He wanted a two bedroom suite and was not happy we didn't have one, saying it was on the website. He mentioned he had a dog so I informed him the pet fee was $100. Mr. Shiny didn't like this either, and told me he never paid for a pet fee at <Brand> before. I informed him this was our policy, and there would be no exceptions. He was checked in to room 920. I had to find where his other reservation was at this point and mke sure a certificate was applied to the one I created for him at our hotel. I spoke to <brand online sytem support> on <brand tech support chat> to find that his reservation was at another <brand hotel> a few exits up. When I saw Mr. Shiny again in the lobby, I called out to let him know I found his other reservation and asked him if he wanted to go somewhere with 2 bedrooms like he wanted, but he would not stop walking away and just yelled that he came here for a reason and wanted to stay here, so I got his other reservation canceled no charge. A few hours later he came to the desk, around 7pm, and was immediately confrontational, wanting to know why I would ever put anyone in that room or on that floor. He said it was very loud with a lot of vibration. I apologized and asked if hew ould like to move but he declined and walked away. 30 minutes later he came back to the desk and said he would be back for my name and employee ID #. I told him I had no employee ID # and would not be giving him my name. He returned after walking his dog and asked for my full name and my manager's name, but I refused and told him I management would be in in the morning and would know who I was. At this point he started demanding I give him my name but I did not. He was started getting louder and was insulting me , saying things I will not repeat. I asked Mr. Shiny if he would like to leave the property, and he replied what he would like to do is shoot me. At that point I told Mr. Shiny he had 15 minutes to collect his things before the police were called, and he invited me to call him and said he would be back to take my picture. I immediately called the police and went to the back office because I did not want my picture taken. The restaurant attendant was here for all of this as well as a guest in another room. Mr. Shiny came down stairs and stayed at the desk for maybe 15 minutes or more, waiting for me to come out so he could take my picture, and even asked some of the employees to take his phone and and take my photo for him. Eventually he tried to go into our back office but was redirected by <employees> and went back to his room. I called the police at 7pm and they did not arrive until afer 8. Mr. Shiny has been evicted from the property and per <AGM> he has been rebated all charges. <Employee> was her as MOD to declare him banned in the presence of the police.",27,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0BC58E0>

360,Turning Down an Octomom,"This was a quick, surreal little interaction on the phone yesterday that was thankfully pleasant and funny!

Here I am, working a 3-11PM. Quiet weekend, only a couple check ins. I get a phone call.

Lady: ""I have a quick question. What's the maximum number of people you can fit in a room?""

Me: ""Four in a room with two queen beds. You could squeeze five into a deluxe suite if you use a rollaway, but more than that and it's breaking fire safety codes, sorry.""

Lady: ""Oh, dang... you're sure you don't have anything that can accommodate 8 kids and 3 adults?""

**EXCUSE ME? DID YOU SAY** ***EIGHT KIDS?!***

Me: ""Erm, no, sorry. I wish I could help, the most we could do is three separate rooms, or two deluxe suites...""

Lady: ""Oh it's no problem, don't worry! I'll just sleep at my baby daddy's house tonight. You have a good night now!""

We don't usually rent to locals anyway because of some issues we've had, but man... that was something special. I don't know what was more shocking: the request, or that she was so pleasant about it!",26,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0BC59A0>
361,My coworker demanded to speak to the police's manager,"I have a new coworker who just isn't working out, and I should write a series of posts about her insanity, but last night she demanded to speak to a manager when the police dispatcher wasn't prioritizing her call to her satisfaction. I've been apologizing to pizza deliverypeople and cab drivers since she started but this is something new.  

I work in a downtown hotel in a sketchy part of town with a homeless shelter next door. We deal with homeless people CONSTANTLY. Normally without much issue but you have to call the cops from time to time. I had kicked this particular woman out of the hotel 5 times during my shift, at first I was being very polite and giving her instructions for getting to the shelter, by the end of my shift I had the inner doors locked and she was rolling around on the ground between the sets of doors. I had called the non emergency line and given my usual excessively polite ""Hey it isn't an emergency but I've got a distraught homeless person refusing to leave, if you could send someone when you get a chance I think she could use some assistance getting to the shelter"".  

Well coworker walks in the door, says OH HELL NO, picks up the phone and dials 911. I only heard her side of the convo, but this is how it went:

Hey I've got a homeless person here you need to send someone to pick her up right away.

I know we already called but that was TEN MINUTES AGO AND WE NEED SOMEONE NOW

NO YOU AREN'T GOING TO *TRY* TO GET SOMEONE OUT HERE, YOU *ARE* GOING TO GET SOME OUT HERE *RIGHT NOW*

EXCUSE ME??? I WANT YOUR BADGE NUMBER RIGHT NOW. I WANT YOUR BADGE NUMBER. RIGHT. NOW.  

WHO IS YOUR SUPERVISOR?? WHO. IS. YOUR, SUPERVISOR?? I WANT THEM ON THE LINE RIGHT NOW   

DON'T YOU DARE HANG UP ON ME!!!  

At which point she slams the receiver down, and gives me an exasperated look like I should be sympathizing with her right now. At this point I just bounced and got the hell out of there, but as I was walking out I could hear her on the phone ""Umm hello, yes, I was just RUDELY hung up on...""",40,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0BC5A00>

She was genuinely concerned that her farts were going to stink up the room and possibly the hallway. She mentioned that she's never been in a hotel before and her stomach was upset. Then she asked if I'd ever had the same problem. I have, was sick with food poisoning on a road trip once. She wanted to know what I did about it and if my farts smelled like poop. Also wanted to know what it means if farts smelled bad. I don't think this was a prank, if so then I played along way too long. That is all.

363,homeless stole my wallet and keys from my office,"Hi, sorry for long post.

I am GY manager at this nearly 600 room hotel. Hotel is half full on weekend but security and I are only two working over night, because GM is too cheap to hire another staff.

Last night, when I went back to manager office from FD to have meal break, I noticed my coat and bag are not there. I had security check the hallway outside the office in case PM shift was pulling a prank on me.

Checking the video, a homeless man came in and took my stuff. 

One of the employee entrance door lock was broken for a long time, and the hotel hasn't fixed it because, ""Waiting for the quote"". Homeless man entered through that door, walked pass by security office, and down the hallway to this office.

During whole time, security was in his office, watching anime with the door closed.

Backpack had just my lunch and change of clothes. Coat pocket had my keys and wallet. I spent all night calling banks and police to report. Btw, police closed the investigation after 6 hours of investigation ""due to lack of evidence.""

When the director of the security showed up at the hotel in the morning, security briefed what happened. Right off the bat, DoS blamed me for not locking the office door. I don't have key to the office because this is shared office with other shift managers. 

In the view of DoS, this was not security's fault, even though a homeless man wandered into the building through the door with broken lock. 

I emailed GM in frustration, and she directed me to speak to DoS. 

This is 100% true story.",17,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0BC5AC0>
364,"Glass in bed, smoking guests & my bad 2 hour morning alone","One guest is complaining smoking smell coming through bathroom, most likely the fan.   Guests on either side and of course I don't know who they are or if they looked like smokers or sketchy.  Do you guys have a system like knocking on doors or just going sorry we'll look into it and then nothing much we can do after that.  (especially at 8am when there are no staff, just me)   Honestly I'm not a bouncer so my mindset is play it off ""ya that's horrible we will be investigating"" but I can't go kicking doors down and investigating all the guests in the area.

Another guest just came up with a shard of glass, said it was from in between his sheets.    To me that seems impossible due to hskpers doing the throw to get the sheet to the other side but hell who am I right.

Next a guest just ripped my face off cause HE booked through OTA.   I know the truth but of course it's my fault he got charged an extra $40 a night and no this is one big scam and WE ARE the OTA (E)

Also had a homeless guy shit soup on our carpet in a back stairwell and have a lovely breakfast on us.

Had to call husband to vent and not walk out on the job.

Side note:  I will be giving free nights and huge discounts for any issues so the owners can suck it and learn to get security or at least 2 staff on the busiest morning of the week for issues.

365,"He's not malicious, just Very, Very stupid","So to set the stage, I work at a property that is next door to another that is franchised by the same company. I am GSM at my property, and whenever my counterpart is off for the other property, I am essentially MOD for both (afternoon/evening shift).
Friday night in January, and it is a quiet night. Suddenly, I get a call from the other hotel. It's one of the Front Desk workers, GSRs(Guest Services Representatives) lets call her R, and she says that she has not seen her coworker for almost an hour and it has been busy. I assume he, lets call him M, has gone to smoke and talk on the phone, and direct her to contact her chain of command to resolve the issue. I am the MOD, but if I can avoid bouncing between properties, I will. Not 5 minutes later, I get a text from one of the AGMs (Assistant General Managers) to go to the property and review the camera footage to find out what is going on.
I arrive at the property to find R showing me the cash drawer completely empty. At this point, my first thought is that M took the money and ran. Our Front Desk cameras record audio as well as video, so that as management we can correct anyone that tries to make false claims about our GSRs. Once I get into the camera system, I see M take a call then both he and R help some check-ins. After that, R leaves the desk and M returns to the call, and then takes a call on his personal phone. Then, he takes all the cash from our front desk cash drawer.
We do not keep much cash on hand, for security reasons. But he empties the drawer of any and all bills, leaving the change. At this point the AGM for the property calls me and I find out that this is probably a scam. I see him leave with cash in hand on the cameras.
My next move, bordering on panic, is to call M. I ask him what he is doing, and he says he is doing something for our franchise holder's VP of hospitality. I tell him rather forcefully that this is a scam, that he should not give them any more info and to return to the hotel. 
Thankfully, he did not give the caller the gift card info from the card he had just purchased with LITERALLY all the cash we had on hand. 
After speaking to everyone involved, AGM included, M was called by someone claiming to be the VP of hospitality from our franchise holder. They told him they need to replace the fire extinguishers, but need money to ship the new extinguishers to the property. He received a second call from ""x shipping company"" that the first call was legitimate. Thus, he sent the scammers an untold amount of his personal money, as well as went and bought a gift card with all the cash we had at the hotel with the intention of giving them that money. 
Thankfully our AGM arrived to give the desk enough cash to function for the weekend, as on a Friday night, a cash shortage is a serious operational problem. 
As I told my AGM, this is the type of scam you hear of 65+ grandmothers getting calls from the ""IRS"" that they have overdue taxes and they must pay immediately. It is ridiculous that one of our GSM's fell for what could be the oldest trick in the book. He's not exactly stupid but there are times where if you shake M's head it would rattle. 
TL,DR: scammers used a classic scam to empty the desk of all their cash",20,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0BC5B80>
366,I'll Take Your Keys Please,"So, this was ORIGINALLY a comment and it was suggested I post to stand on it's own. I was in response to ""Mophead Pothead""

Lol, I used to work as security at the resort where I'm currently the Night Auditor. There used to be a housekeeper that had been told MANY times she needed to keep her keys on her person and not on the cart, which is often in the hall in plain view. The house keeper keys can access any room on the resort, so losing a set is a huge problem.

So one day I was contacted by the Housekeeping manager, she told me to go swipe the keys off her cart. The job wasn't hard, the keys were on top of the cart in plain view. I just walked up, grabbed them, and brought them to the manager.

It took the housekeeper until the end of the shift to report them missing. Apparently she had been having other housekeepers open doors for her so she could do her job. Apparently the non-manager housekeeping staff cover for each other.

So at the end of the shift I was summoned to the office. I arrived just in time to see the housekeeper try to explain that she did not know where the keys were. The manager took them out of the drawer. ""You mean these keys? Security found them abandoned in the hallway."" Then they fired her and had me escort her off property.",64,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0BC5BE0>
367,Blood EVERYWHERE!,"So, as a bit of background, many moons ago, when I lived in New England, I used to work as an EMT. Long story short, I got burned out, went into Security, moved to Florida, got a job as Security at the resort I'm at and moved up into Night Audit. This story happened when I was still working Security.

So, I was between my rounds, up at the front desk chit chatting with the Front Desk Agent when the elevator opened and a family burst forth from the elevator, the father was carrying his son, the mother was hysterical, and the daughter was........well she was just all ""Meh"" about what was going on. The son was bleeding rather heavily from his foot. The blood was just dumping all over the wood floors.

I direct the Front Desk Agent to get the medical kit from the back and go over to the family and in my ""way too calm"" EMT voice. I ask what happened all while going to examine the kids foot, after they put him on the tile island in the middle of the room. I know what's wrong before they tell me, mostly because the shell is protruding from the kids foot. Stepping on shells is an extremely common problem here, Sandals were invented for a reason. 

I radio PBX and tell them to call 911 for a shell impaled in a childs foot, and to call housekeeping with a hazmat kit (mostly just a good mop, bleach, and a nice smelling cleaner) to clean up the blood. The FD Agent brings me the first aid kit and I wrap the foot as best as I can, explaining to the overbearing, hovering mother why you never remove impaled objects. Then I keep the foot elevated until EMS arrives, they take him away, the father thanks me and the family goes away. 

The whole situation lasted maybe 15 minutes. I go about my day telling guests, no you can't smoke by the pool, and no you cant throw beer bottles at the birds, and stop throwing starfish into the ocean, and sir, stop trying to take selfies with that alligator. (These all didn't happen on the same day, I'd have quit.)

Fast forward a few days later, someone that looks vaguely familiar approaches me. I realize it's the father. He comes up to me and shakes my hand, tells me he's been looking for me for a couple of days. He then hands me a cash bill. I don't look at it when he hands it to me, it's kind of rude to marvel at a tip in front of the guest. He thanks me for helping his son. We chit chat for a few minutes, and he thanks me again and then leaves. I take the bill out of my pocket, it's a $100 dollar bill. HOLY CARP!

Security rarely gets tipped but that's way over the top.",135,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0BC5C40>
368,Vegas Front Desk thought our pal Was the owner.,"Was just reading about guests claiming to be friends with the owner.

Sort of the opposite happened to us. 

In 1973 we were a group of 4 rag tag camper/adventureres who finally reached Vegas. 

Walked into a large fancy hotel. One of our group asked reception if there were any messages for him. ( he had met a girl on our travels that was heading there and who had promised to leave a message for him) 

Well turns out Pals name was the exact same name as the hotel owner.

We were so impressed by the immediate smiles and service and care for our general well being - having zero idea about this name thing. 

Well it didn't take very long for it all to come crashing down. 

One of the staff accused Pal of lying to get such great attention but when he showed his ID it was kinda funny. 

It was great while it lasted though.  

And they didn't make us pay.

369,awesome Front Desk Agent saved a birthday celebration,"Just a story to let you guys know that you're appreciated, I know how hard Front Desk can be, I worked the front desk for years but one if you really came through for me today so thank you!

Onto the story: 

My soon to be 8 year old kiddo asked for a night in a hotel with an indoor pool for his birthday gift. We have a tight budget and this would stretch it but I did some trusty internet searching and phone calls confirming the pools were open etc and got a great deal. Booked at Noon for 3pm check in-which was already inside the cancelation window. 

Get to hotel and chatted with the Front Desk agent while he checked us in. Told him about our grand plans for swimming and dinner at the Golden Arches.

Here's where the Front Desk saved the day-turns out I called a different location to confirm the pool open and theirs was CLOSED! He very kindly said he hadn't charged the card and he would cancel with no penalty, ensuring we could go to another hotel. I didn't even have to ask him, completely his offer. I am now loyal to that location forever-any hotel room needed and we're there.

So awesome Front Desk Guy-Thank You!!! You really helped make a happy birthday!

370,Guest makes a big deal out of wrong address,"Strap in guys, this is a long one

So I come into work for audit and before I can even clock in or take off my coat my newly hired coworker is scrambling around asking for my help. I get clocked in and go over to help her and it's a fairly standard issue, we have a guest who is trying to check in, but we can't find their reservation. I ask for the standard info, last name and confirmation number, but can't find this guy. I look in past reservations and future reservations, but can't find him. I ask to see is confirmation email and it does show our address. 

A common problem we have is 3rd parties will frequently mix up my locations address with another hotel of the same name in the same city. The guest did book through a 3rd party so the next logical step was to call our sister hotel and ask if they had him, which they did. 

I feel like I have to mention at this point in the story that the guest was a stereotypically grumpy old man so even getting to this point in the encounter he was questioning if I knew what I was doing and generally letting his displeasure with the situation be known. So I get in touch with our sister hotel and my suspicion is confirmed, they do in fact have this guest at their location instead of ours.

I go to explain to the guest that there was a mistake on the 3rd party's website and they are at our other location about 6 minutes away. However, he insists on calling the 3rd party he booked through. Let me tell you I felt so bad for the poor bastard that picked up the phone. Immediately this guy starts digging into the employee before he can even ask for the guest's name (he had the phone on speaker so I heard everything). 

It was the worst kind of angry customer too, he didn't scream or yell or anything like that. It almost sounded like an old crotchety school teacher giving his students shit and lecturing them about some minor mistake they made. The poor employee had to fight to get any foothold in the conversation and even when he was able to finish a sentence, the old guy would reiterate the same thing a few more times before responding to what the employee said.

Acknowledging the fact that I solved the guest's issue and had located the correct hotel in the span of 5-6 minutes, he was now standing at the front desk chewing the 3rd party's ear off with questions he already had the answer to. Eventually this guy's wife comes up to him and practically begs him to leave. She restates what I said about their reservation being at another hotel and he just shushes her and goes back to attacking the employee on the phone.

Eventually we reach the end of the phone call and this poor guy has to ask the guest for his phone number (to call him back) at least 10 different times. Everytime he asks the old guy goes on a speil about how their website told him to go here, but we don't have his reservation. I wasn't even the one being talked to and it was aggravating the hell out of me.

So finally after asking for the 3rd party employee's name and ID number the guest gives him his phone number and hangs up. I assume at this point he's going to maybe ask me for the correct address again and head out, but he just stands there. I tell him again that his reservation is actually at our sister hotel only about 6 minutes away and to check in they'll have to head over there. He says he'll wait on the 3rd party to call back.

I get wanting to be sure and confirm everything, but I literally just had the other hotel on the phone and confirmed that their reservation was at that hotel. His wife asks him again to please just go, she says she's tired and they already know where the correct hotel is. He mentions something about the 3rd party transferring their reservation back to my location. The hell they were, I did not want this guy in my hotel after showing me how willing he was to complain about the smallest of non issues.

Then we have to throw in the obligatory racism because they're old I guess. They both start making fun of the employee's name and complaining about how ""he's probably not even from this country"", all the standard racist old people BS. So after a few minutes the 3rd party calls back (he doesn't have it on speaker this time so I can't hear anything from the other end). 

I  have to assume he told the guest the exact same thing I did, because after reiterating the same couple issues to this poor guy again he begrudgingly started putting his coat back on and heading for the door. But before he left I heard him tell the 3rd party employee to have a manager call him tomorrow to ""discuss the issue further"". 

So at 11:30pm, a full half an hour after I got to work and 25 minutes after I had solved the problem initially, they finally left to go to the correct hotel. I'm glad I wasn't on the end of this guy's tirade for a majority of this encounter, but just having to sit there and listen to his phone calls and his pleading wife drove me nuts. I could not wait for them to just go.

Here's to hoping the rest of my night will go smoothly and hopefully those guests don't give our sister hotel too much trouble during their stay.

Edit: Internet was being wacky when I tried to post this and it looks like it posted 2 other times besides this one. I deleted the other posts, but if this is the 3rd time you're seeing this that's probably why",35,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0BC5D60>
371,An Interesting Request,"Today I received a call from a guest complaining about the couch in their suite. It's a pull out bed, and somehow the frame has been broken without anyone noticing. No surprise, considering we don't have a maintence man and the manager is not very concerned about hiring one. Because of this my shifts are often spent moving guests around and trying to maneuver around maintence problems I have no experience or training in dealing with. 

Not having any more solutions, I told the guest I'd be happy to move them, and I'd of course offer them a discount for their trouble. We're not supposed to do this, but at this point us employees run the place and the manager just sort of shows up to help with laundry occasionaly. Of course my guest was annoyed, understandably so, and didn't seem too keen on moving rooms. 

I once again offered a discount and told her she's welcome to stay in the room if she doesn't want to move. But I was honest and said there truly wasn't another solution. There was a moment of silence on the phone while she contemplated, and then:

""Can you just bring me another couch?""

""...I'm sorry, what?""

""Can you bring me another couch? Like move another one in here?""

I was kind of shocked into silence, to be honest. I've had guests ask about giving them a new TV, but this is the first time I've had someone honest to God ask for a whole new piece of furniture. I didn't mention just how much time shoving a huge couch into a crowded room would take, and just told her we were out of couches. 🤷

I've only been working in this industry for about a year and a half, but am I crazy? Is this a thing in some hotels? Do they just have rooms with extra furniture for the front desk people to cart into rooms that need it?",18,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0BC5DC0>
372,A Thrilling Conclusion,"A thrilling update to my original post:

Today (Saturday) I finally kicked out the woman who cause all of these problems. 

Turned out, this potential prostitute was staying at the hotel, on the 5th floor. I found this out the day after her noise complaint tirade. 

I had half a mind to kick her out when she came to renew her keys, but I decided not to. Water under the bridge, as they say (against my better judgement, but I was in a bleeding heart kind of fashion that moment). 

Today, however, she makes another reservation to extend. Two hours after check out, we call her a couple times to remind her to come down, and swipe her card for incidentals (prepay through a 3rd party. Extending day by day. The usual).

When she comes down, her ID and the CC don’t match. I ask her for a CC that matches her ID. She says it’s up in the room, and she’ll be right back down. 

45 minutes pass, and no sight of her. I decide to call up again, as I want this resolved before the end of my AM shift. 

She. Loses. It. On. Me. 

How dare I call her more than once?
Why am I picking on her for doing nothing?
Just take her money and shut up. 
I’m racist, discriminatory, a jack ass, a fucker. 

I roll my eyes, and sigh. And in a calm voice let her know that I am asking her to leave. She rages again, and I hang up. 

I call the police, and while I’m on the phone, she comes back down to yell some more. 

Since I am on the phone, she complains to the front desk supervisor (I’m FOM) about how horrible I am. 

He says “The way you choose to speak to our staff is deplorable. Learn to have basic human respect”. 

The end is anticlimactic. She takes FOREVER to leave the room, and spends 15 minutes talking to the police about how this is discrimination because she is Hispanic, and that she wants me arrested, fired, and wants to sue me. 

Turns out, we have the right to refuse service for any reason. 

They left, and I had my just deserts.

Tdlr: the bitch who caused me endless grief for a noise complaint, gets kicked out for being a bitch.

373,"Mophead, Pothead","This happened several years ago now but I just remembered it and laughed, so I thought y'all still in the business would probably enjoy.

We had this housekeeper who was not the sharpest tool in the shed.  Didn't matter how many times we talked to him about checking sheets and pillowcases for hair, or about making sure to vacuum the WHOLE rug, or about scrubbing the soap scum out of the showers, he never quite got the message.  He really shouldn't have been kept on the staff as long as he was, but my boss was soft on him for some reason.  Anyways.

This particular day, business as usual, my colleague and I are going about our usual inspections, ping-ponging around the hotel nonstop.  We would always tag-team this kid's rooms because there was SO much to be fixed in every room.  Unfortunately for us, we were at a disadvantage this day because my co-inspector was suffering from a cold and was very congested.

Room 203.  Kid cleans the room, then my colleague inspects it, fixes everything he missed, and punches the room Vacant Ready.  Apparently, there was a fairly strong marijuana odor in the room, and the only person who noticed it was the dumbass housekeeper.  And did he notify either of the inspectors?  No.

Instead, he waited until somebody checked into the room, then he knocked on the door and asked the guest directly ""Do you smell pot?""

374,The Trucken Conspiracy,"I'm currently working as the FOM at a hotel that is close to the action at the Canadian Parliament. 

Don't worry, I'm not here to give any opinions on the matter, but frankly it's nice to see what people look like, and for the most part, these guest are thanking us for all the hard work that we've done during the Apocalypse and are generally pleasent. And besides a few instances, it's nice not having 5 arrivals a night. 

Anyways, last week was one of the craziest weekends I've seen in a long time. But it went by so fast, that I'm writing to you from the following weekend. 

I know there are alot of conspiracies centering around COVID, government regulations, the mainstream media... The front desk seems to hear them all as we make conversation with the guests.

But today, I've had several guests ask if the Canadian government is buying out hotel rooms so that the Freedom Convoy has nowhere to stay or that less of them can stay in the area. 

And honestly, given what's been going on, it's not the most ridiculous thing I've heard this week and it's easy to understand why someone would think this. 

I can't speak for all the hotels in the area, but we can't sell out because we don't have enough housekeepers to clean all the room or even enough experienced staff to handle this amount of guest. PERIOD

We did it last weekend and barely came out with our lives ;) 

I'm genuinely curious if this is a thing that is actually happening at some hotels. And regardless of why there here, business is BOOMIN

375,"RIP Housekeeping, Liar Guy, and Entitled Brat","Welcome to another Nub Audit...I mean... Daywalker theatre! I work six days a week (voluntarily), and Saturday is my only daywalker day. All other days, I'm a night audit. So, this all happened in the first hour of my shift!

We just lost our room inspector. We also lost a housekeeper to Florida. This...sucks. We are down to two. Well, one housekeeper decides to no show yesterday and today. We can't even fire her, as we are short as is. This means, our manager is in cleaning rooms, instead of inspecting them. So, checkins may be late today. Lovely.

We had a guest come in to check in early. I explain to him that we are short a housekeeper, so I can't allow early checkins. He throws a fit because he was ""promised"" an early checkin. To save my manager some hassle, I decide to give in (for once), and I shuffled some checkins around to let him in early. I told him the amount, and gave my usual spiel ""Your total is $xxx.xx. That includes room and tax plus a 15% incidental hold. The hold is normally released within three days, depending on your bank."" Well, hold on. He doesn't want to pay that much. His total is $yyy.yy. I explain that incidental holds are industry standard, only to get ""That's bullshit. I just stayed at a Harriott, and they did \*not\* charge me any extra. This will be the last day I stay at your hotel."" With a clearly fake smile, I send him on his way. Might I add, he is a local, told me he was here for ""personal business"", and will be expecting a guest, but they won't be staying the night. Hmm...

This one is a weird one. Kid comes in. He has a reservation, but the other hotel he was at lost his wallet. Sorry, not much I can do about that, but I do let him charge his phone. He calls his dad and explodes at him for about ten minutes, saying he was stupid cause he won't call the old hotel. He tells the dad to call the hotel and tell them they have ten minutes to find his wallet or the police will surround the place. He gets quiet after that, so all is fine. A DNR guest comes down, and tries to extend. I tell him he can't, as his card declined (truth). He tries to get me to swipe it again, but I see it's CashApp. He gets pissed, and the kid starts bonding with him! He asks for a late checkout, I give him a half hour. Kid starts yelling at me. DNR asks kid if he is checking in, Kid says maybe not now. I smile and go ""I can cancel your reservation anytime you want."" Kid shuts up. Manager comes down, I explain everything in her office, kid is gone by the time I get back. DNR comes down, asks my name, then leaves.

I thought crazy happened at nights!

edit: Kid comes back. His wallet was in his pocket the \*entire\* time. I look at his ID, he obviously lost weight and dyed his hair if it is him. Problem is, I have trouble distinguishing people once they dye their hair. That's something I usually focus in on, hair styles and color. So, I go to get my manager to double check. We come back, he threatens to call the police on me! I'm offending him so bad. Manager threatens to kick him out, he starts simpering. We decide to let him stay, but put him on a first floor room where we can keep an eye on him.

Edit 2: DNR put out a guest assistance and got all his points back, as well as additional points for a total of $165 dollars. They also got a free night at a close hotel, though we called to warn them and they said they would not let him stay.",15,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0BC5F40>
376,Guest complains about the shape of the room.,"So this happened many, many years ago. I studied Hospitality at college and for my internship I worked the front desk of a 4 star center of London Hotel. It was mainly business stays during the week and weekends were low rate getaways. The hotel was built square shaped so 95 percent of the rooms along the straight edges were the typical rectangular shape but the rooms at each corner were square shaped. 
One afternoon I had an American lady check in and because it was weekday most of the rooms were already taken by business guests getting a business rate and therefore get the regular rooms. If we had a private guest paying private prices we would give them the larger square rooms.
The lady was a private paying guest so checked her into on of the corner rooms. About half an hour later the lady came back down to reception to complain that her room was “too square”. I must have had a quizzical look on my face because she repeated her complaint. I had had a lot of different reasons for a guest wanting to change rooms but the shape of the room had never been one of them. Any way, being a 4 star hotel we would go above and beyond to make sure all our guests are happy so I put her into one of the regular rooms. Half an hour later she comes back down to complain that her room was smaller than her first room. I had to explain that we basically have two types of room, the smaller rectangular ones or the larger square ones. In order to keep her happy I took £20 off the room rate. She was happy with that and that was it for the night. 
The next morning she came down to check out and while she was paying her bill she asked me to call her a cab. I had to really bite my tongue to not say “Ok, you’re a cab.”",6,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0BC5FA0>
377,Xcells Stories Vol. 9,"Back again with a new installment of the never-ending saga.

Sit back, get your favorite warm beverage of choice and read on.

&#x200B;

*Shit and the fan*

Every now and then there's that event that shakes you to the core.  Something that makes you question your sanity.

This was one of the worst nights in this hotel I am currently at.

Bit of background first.

A guest comes with his ""friend"" telling me he booked a room and won't use it but since it is already checked in and wants his friend to use it. No worries, some bad vibes from the guy but I didn't want to fuck around longer than I have cuz that night there was a shit ton of paperwork to do.

Added accompanying to the reservation, got the ID and card just to be safe.

A few hours later a guy comes with a woman in her forties, aside from her bag they had a bag from the local supermarket. Nothing out of ordinary there. She waited in the lobby while he parks the car. Being a cheap fuck he didn't want to park it in the hotel for 15€ after all he is sleeping here for free so why pay for parking?

While she was waiting for him she asked if the bar is open to which I replied that it´s closed but I can sell you soft drinks and water.

My rationale here was, they were going to be drunk and probably be loud in the room. Not on my watch. They brought a few things upstairs got down and out. 20 minutes later they came back, guy was a bit irritated. They went up and I think nothing of it.

30 minutes later it was 4AM, I thought I heard screams from the elevator. Shit, what now.

The elevator comes to the ground floor and I am standing right in front of it trying to investigate what in the fuck is the commotion.

Doors open.

The woman is on the floor and the guy above her. She was bleeding from the nose and the guy was in a drug-addled rage. Before I can do anything guy passes by me and almost runs out of the front door yelling something unintelligible.

My first reaction is to help the lady, and I wanted to call the ambulance and the police which she declines multiple times.

X: Listen, I can't let you out go anywhere in that kind of state. You are bleeding from the nose and judging by a few bruises you might have concussion. I will call an ambulance and the police.  
FG(Female Guest): NO! I WILL BE FINE, LET ME REST FOR A WHILE AND I WILL BE GONE IN A FEW MINUTES.

At this time my ""breakfast supervisor""(female) came to the front desk to investigate the situation. Since she is a woman I thought she could put some sense into her. They kept talking and I called the police and ambulance even tho she declined it multiple times.

She complained at the time her head hurts badly, definitely a concussion and the nose is broken too. Shit.

I motioned my coworker to keep her occupied, I called the ambulance and the police. While they were talking I got her bag so at least I had some leverage to keep her here.

Ambulance comes and she went off declining everything but the doc and the driver got all the info from me before they came inside the lobby. After long back and forth she did eventually got herself checked out and they wanted to take her to the hospital. She fought hard against that. Didn't want anything she just wanted to go home which is a town at least 6 hours drive or about the same with a train. Police eventually showed up, started getting info from my coworker, and trying to get a sense of what the fuck is going on. The guest didn't want to do anything and just wanted to go home, cop was annoyed to be here and didn't want any info I could provide.

At the same time, the guy that brought his ""friend"" over was there with his wife trying to make sense of what happened. Apparently, they were related, great family. 

Eventually, cops decided to fuck off to more important matters, outside it was snowing like crazy.

The medics waited for 10-15 minutes more in case her ""friends"" can convince her to go to the hospital.

No dice, eventually they collected the deposit from the room that was paid in cash. I checked the room. Almost untouched, the altercation began in the room there were 2 bloody towels.

Paid out the deposit the guy left his phone number and after talking with her they went their own way.

The woman was in the lobby for 30 minutes almost crying and complaining about her head.

Turns out the guy stole 400€ and her bank card as well. We couldn't do anything more for her as she declined any help. Eventually, she asked for a taxi and she was gone.

I wrote my report and went home after the shift not saying much. I was shaken, beaten, angry. How could a human do this to another human? Have we as a society failed.

At the time guy came out of the elevator I was ready to knock him the fuck out cold but that would just implicate me more in a matter I don't want to be a part of. 

What a night. My managers were shocked and thankfully didn't ask too many questions but they were glad I was in the shift.

&#x200B;

*Casanova*

There is always that one booking where you just know something's up but nothing illegal. 

Cue 10:30 PM, Nightshift just started. Only one check-in left.

The guy mercifully shows up not 10 minutes afterward with a pretty stunning woman. Now for context, the guy is your average Joe. Nothing special about him but he dressed nicely, well-trimmed beard, and had good manners.

Check-in is done they go up to their room. 2 hours later the woman comes down says goodbye and goes her way. She looked as she had her servicing done right as the hair was not as neat and clothes look like they were put in a hurry. The guy comes down, buys a beer, and heads in front of the hotel for a smoke. I myself decided to have a smoke too.

While outside he was on the phone texting, someone. I light up my cigarette and check my phone.

Out of the blue, he strikes a conversation with me. Like what are the hotspots for hanging out, bars clubs etc. I think nothing of it and give him the relevant info. The guy is in town for 3 days, COVID restrictions weren't that hard at that point so he could roam around.  
After we have done smoking I head to my computer to start my End of Day stuff and he went up to the room. 20 minutes later he said goodbye and went out to the city. 

Just before 4 AM he comes in again with a blonde bombshell under his arm. Politely saying good morning to me as well as his companion.

Holy shit, 2 in one night guys good.

Just before my shift ends the woman came down to the reception, said goodbye, and jumped into a taxi that just pulled up. Okay, nothing I haven't seen before. A few moments later guy came down, asked me to extend the stay for his reservation for 2 more nights, and slipped me 10€ tip.

""Thanks for the info, if the first place is as good as the others you mentioned you might have yourself a loyal customer.""

He was a member of our loyalty program so I don't know what he meant by that.

The shift ended and I went home. Tomorrow/today is another night shift.

When I came back for the next shift the first thing I saw is him saying good evening to me with another hottie. What in the fuck, does this guy have clockwork balls or what? Anyway, during the night he had 3 different women with him. I was beginning to suspect they were escorts but those women are different and didn't give that kind of vibe to me. When the last girl said goodbye to me when I was out in the front smoking the guy came also for a smoke. He saw me came to me and said,

""Helluva city, beautiful women everywhere. You must be living the dream.""

X: ""No not really.""

G: ""Why not, have you been to places you told me? The women are there lonely, just waiting for someone to pay attention to them. Sorry if this is a personal question but are you gay?""

X: ""Uh, no. I don't see how the question is relevant here.""

G: ""Didn't think you were, you look like the kind of guy that would be very popular with women.""

X: ""I would if I tried, I got hurt in the process too many times. That's why I don't bother anymore.""

G: ""Well the difference here is I do to them what they did to me and by extension to you. You may think I am just another fuckboy or a pimp or whatever but I assure you it's not like that.""

X: ""You do you, I don't judge and not to sound brash but honestly I don't care.""

G: ""I feel you, good sir, you have been through a lot. We are one and the same but you chose your way and I chose mine. You should think about doing the same as I do. It helps me to cope and the sex is always good.""

X: ""Maybe, maybe not. I don't think sleeping around with anything on 2 legs and 2 holes between is going to help me in any way shape or form.""

G: ""That's the whole point, good sir. Try it out see if it can help you fill the void, or don't, and keep searching for someone to fill your void. Both are valid ways. Anyway getting some sleep after this night would be a good idea, but please think about it. Come out with me one night and we will talk more and see if we can fill your void for at least a few hours.""

X: ""Thank you very much but I respectfully decline the offer.""

G: ""That bad eh? Well, I wish you all the best my good sir. I hope one day you will find someone. I know I won't but I have to do what I do in order not to break. Good night.""

X: ""Good night.""

WHAT THE FUCK? Guy knew how to talk and the guy knew how to read people. While talking to him he was genuinely trying to make me feel better about myself. Well if I was not old-school cool and a hopeless romantic with a desire to find a meaningful relationship I would take him up. Hit up the city, ""fill my void"" as he put it.

After he checked out he came back a week or so later. Whatever he is looking for I hope he finds it because he fights with his loss the only way he knows.

Well, that's it for this installment. I still got 5 hours of a shift to go through.

378,Do you really think you’re going to get away with that?,Local night audit for a small “express” hotel chain checked a guy and girl in lastnight everything went smooth. I explained the no pets and no smoking policy and he signs saying he agrees well after check in I notice them come in after parking and the girl was holding her stomach area which looked quite big on her petite from but I didn’t think a whole lot of it. Fast forward to time to pass out folios in the am and I as I get to their room I’m smacked in the face by some super strong weed. As I’m sniffing trying to pinpoint the room I hear what sounds like scratching and a slight growl. So I run back the cameras and see the lady take a small-medium dog out of her jacket once they exited the elevator. Not only were they smoking but also smuggled a dog in. The kicker is he was traveling and his company was paying all charges associated with the room so he may loose his job when his boss sees a two night stay cost almost a grand.,45,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0BC60A0>
379,"Yeah, I don't know him.","So, as a bit of background, I work at a resort. It's privately owned. The owner is SUPER cool, but he hates when people drop his name to try to get free stuff. We have standing orders to call him if people try to name drop. It's awesome. Besides, whenever he DOES have a guest, he puts them in the system himself, and we ALWAYS know well in advance that the owner has a guest, and even the few times he's done a last minute stay, he calls us to let us know.

At the time I was covering the second half of second shift as well as my Night Audit shift because everyone had Covid. So this guy comes in a few months back when we were at 100% capacity. Him and his large (in every sense of the word) family. M = Me LM = Large Man O = Owner.

M - ""Hello welcome to Resort. How can I help you?""

LM - ""I need a room""

M - ""Alright sir did you make a reservation?""

LM - ""No""

M - ""Alright sir, unfortunately we are 100% booked. I do apologize""

LM - ""I need a room though, I'm friends with (Owner)."" He waves his phone in my face showing that the name of the person he was texting with was the same name as the owner. 

M - ""I see that sir but I'm afraid that doesn't change the fact that we are 100% booked""

LM - ""Well then I'll just have to call (Owner)""

M - ""There's no need to call him, let me get your name and I'll go in back and figure this out.""

LM gave me his name, I went in back and immediately called the Owner.

M - ""Hello, this is (Me), sorry to bother you but I have a guy here saying he knows you, his name is (Large Man).

O - ""Yeah, I don't know him.""

M - ""Okay, thanks, have a good night""

So we hang up and I go to the front desk. LM is smirking.

M - ""Alright sir, I just spoke with the owner (the smile fades), so as we are still at capacity, I'm going to have to ask you to leave.""

He then left, no fight, no arguing, I called his bluff and I guess he knew it. He and his large family left to go con someone else. I wish they were ALL that easy. Unfortunately some of them try to maintain the ruse.",28,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0BC6100>
380,"I am doing business with the esthablishment, youre job is to take money and give rooms, leave me alone.","So I have some dude parked in my parking lot for the last 2 hours now, I have attempted to signal him with a flashlight  to come to the frontdesk but he flashes his lights back at me and doesnt leave. So I walk up to the car in attempt to find out why his there. As I get closer, he comes out and I ask him to leave because he doesnt have a room here so he cant be on the property. He tells me he is doing business with someone on the property, refuses to give me the name of the person/room number and tells me that I am not security or the police so its none of my business as to why he is on my property. He tells me its my job to take money and give rooms, and that since he is doing nothing illegal I should go back to the office, calls me the ""n"" word (he looks very white to me, and hearing that word out of his mouth gets me kinda mad too but I keep my composure), starts telling me off saying that if I have an issue I should just call the cops. He legit gets mad at me, seeing him angry actually makes me laugh, and I laugh all the way back to the office. I want to wait for my manager to come in, I can call the non emergency number but that has always proved to be useless cause the cops will get here like 10 hours later. So we wait for another hour till my manager is here.",24,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0BC6160>
381,Welcome to the ever so cozy DnR list.,"This was a while ago but the same guest showed up again so it rehashed the frustration and giggles out of me. 

About August of 2021 I had a woman come into the lobby trying to rent a room. There were a few big bright red flags. 1) she was covered in blood, 2) she was shaking and unable to focus, 3) she only came in with a piece of paper. The conversation goes: 

Me: Good Evening. How can I help you tonight?

Her: I need to get a room for 1, no 2 adults, and 3 kids. 

Me: Okay so a double is going to be 120+ taxes and any other fees/ deposits. I'll need your I.D. and form of payment. 

Her: I don't have my I.D. but this is my brothers and I want to use this card. (Indicates a restaurant receipt with a card number scribbled on it. I recognized the card number since it was my MILs and she had shown me the card when she got it since it had a family picture on it.) 

Me: Ma'am I need your I.D. with a card in your name.

She left and brought in a man. 

Her: This is my brother. This is his I.D. and we want to use *this* card. (still trying to give me the receipt. The man on the I.D. was a Hispanic man around 5'11. The man she brought in was a white man closer to my height at 4'11.)

Me: Ma'am I need a physical card with a name matching an I.D. 

Her: Why can't you just take this one? And here is an I.D. (This was the I.D of an Asian woman. She was white)

Me: Ma'am I have no way of knowing if that card belongs to you. 

Him: What ever happened to the honor system?

Me: Sir I cannot not begin to explain to you why that is the absolute dumbest thing I have heard today, and I have a 10 year old brother who spent 20 minutes explaining how my hair grows from the bottom of our existing hair and not out the top of our heads. 

Her: You will take this card.

Me: No I will not. No one will. If you cannot provide sufficient Identification then I have to ask you to leave. However i will be taking those 2 I.Ds from you and you will no longer be welcome to stay at any hotels owned by this company.  

They  went to argue until I threatened to call the police. As they walked out the door I called the police anyways. I turned in the I.Ds and video of the 2 people who came in. I called MIL and told her to lock the card. They got caught at another hotel trying to use the same card on a receipt with another I.D. that didn't belong to either of them. 

Now to the present.

Her: I need a room.

Me: I need you to leave.

Her: Excuse me? I am a paying customer. 

Me: You provided me with 2 I.Ds that did not belong to you and a card on a restaurant receipt from the restaurant you work in.... Sorry, worked in. You got fired didn't you? Or did my mother-in-law not report you for stealing her card information. Now I do believe I asked you to leave nicely. I won't ask again. Willing or not you will be removed from this property. I suggest you take this chance before I call security to hold you until the police get her for you trespassing.

She was held by security for trespassing.",19,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0BC61C0>
382,Apparently hotels are now the town drunk tank.,"This afternoon our local pd rolls up with two very drunk dudes in tow.   Officer demands my FOM rent them a room for their new buddies.   FOM says nope,  we aren't babysitting drunk dudes they need to move on down the road.   Officer then demands to speak to me.   I come out and remind them that I don't rent to locals.   Especially drunk ones.   He had the nerve to ask me what I think he should do with them since none of the other hotels will take them either.   I reply,  how about jail?  Isn't that what the drunk tank is for?  I go back to my office and not ten minutes later FOM comes storming in to tell me there are two shower drunk guys stumbling around in our parking lot falling into people's cars.   She asks what to do.   My response?  Call 911 and report the public intox and let the police come back for them.   WTH?  Are we the town drunk tank now?",30,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0BC6220>
383,Non-guest upset about everything.,"I have a trainee with me tonight and even though he has literally a week experience he was a man and obviously to Mr. Nonguest this meant my trainee knew more than I did. For the beginning part of the interaction the man dealt with my trainee and not me. I was in the back letting him get his experience in. 

We’ve ran audit, things were actually pretty chill to be as full as we were. Then in he comes- well, he had a woman call for him to make a reservation despite apparently being out in the cold for two hours (it was now 2:45 am). She makes the reservation with my trainee. Doesn’t mention that this man would have no form of identification in any way or a credit card on him. 

When he walks in he’s one of those men- no offense to men, but you all know the type. A problem. A male Karen. But it’s nothing extreme so I let my trainee handle it for now. Then I hear him explain the lack of everything and then I step out. He explains he’ll just have his company send a authorization form for it in the morning and we could just use the card it’s booked under. Nope. I explained to him why we needed something here on property to charge- be it a cc authorization or a credit card. This was unacceptable to him. So he looks at my trainee asking HIM to bend the rules. He explains that he has a room at a muuuuuuch nicer hotel (A not that good hotel behind a fast food restaurant. He doesn't really need this room- he just needs it because ""he can't find an uber in this shithole town."" So I offered him a card for the local 24/7 ride service and he snarled his nose and told me he's called every service and they all were too busy. Okay. 

But even after that he just goes back to asking the rules to be bent for him. I explain the policy and he just shoves his phone at me with the woman who booked the room. She didn't actually have access to the company card- she just had the numbers on file and she could only get the cc authorization form to us in the morning. UHHHH yeah no. So he jerks his phone back and goes a few feet away and asks the woman if this is normal or am I being unreasonable. 

He starts cursing up a storm about how shitty the hotel is and he's fucking cold outside and blah blah blah, his hotel is literally in the shitty side of town. It we're downtown in a brand new hotel. 

Then we hear him on the phone with the car service he did end up calling because he hadn't actually called that one before. He calls them, and is just as aggressive with them. He demands a confirmation of the exact time they'll be there. ""Do you MEAN sometime between 3:00 and 3:30 or do you mean fucking 4am?"" 

Everything about the interaction was just off. And honestly it would have went smoother if he stopped bitching for a minute and actually listened or explained anything. Instead he came in already obnoxious, demanding to just be given his room- the woman had called and he wanted his room key, now.",9,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0BC6280>
384,Ya got a warrant?,"I’ll keep it short and simple, I’m the night auditor at a 3 star chain hotel that rhymes with Milton to set the mood. At around 3 am the cops roll up and start by asking what room a guest is in. So I make it simple and ask to see the warrant. The typical response of “oh I don’t need one, this is for a blah blah case” comes and so I tell him bye bye. 
He’s not happy with the response so I slightly break the rules and agree to phone them, and if they come down or agree to let the cops come to them I’d oblige. Well there’s no answer, so again I say bye bye. 
Now it’s turned from questions about a case to a missing person, and just after that he changes it to a missing juvenile case. I’m assuming he was phishing for me to give it up if the issue was grievous enough but I stood firm and told him to come back with that warrant and I’ll gladly give him the room number. Don’t give up your guests liberties just because someone wants to skirt the official channels, we serve our guests not the law.

UPDATE: The guest in question is still in fact with us, it is not a DV situation. Apparently a while back his brother ran away, they reported it, and the younger brother showed back up a day later. Fast forward to the post (a few weeks) and the officer came to discuss this at 3 am for more details. I told the guest police were looking but didn’t give info, and he thanked me for not letting them pound on his door at 3 am and went to talk with them in person.",63,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0BC62E0>

387,Lady has problems with thermostat,"A lady in a wheelchair checks in and I can already tell she’s going to be a problem. To begin, her reservation was too expensive and she deserves a comped room for her handicap (her words, not mine), breakfast is too late on the weekends (it’s 7-10 like always), and she’s mad she can’t get an accesible room (we are sold out of those and she booked like ten minutes before showing up).  Cue the phone ringing and when I glance at the console, I roll my eyes. 

Me: “Front Desk?”

Her: “I have a problem with my thermostat.”

Me: “What seems to be the issue?”

Her: “I can’t make it warm!”

Me: “Can you describe the thermostat to me?”

Her: “I’m in a wheelchair how am I supposed to look at it while I’m on the phone?!?”

*At this point I almost told her that her wheelchair didn’t help or hinder her eyesight, but I felt it was a little too bitchy so I held my tongue*

Me: “We are in the middle of remodeling some of our rooms, so some of them are different than the others. I can’t help very well if I don’t know which one it is.”

Her: “It says Honeywell”

Me: “Can you describe like the buttons, layout, anything?”

Her: describes the thermostat

Myself: “Okay, go ahead and press ‘mode’ to put it into heat setting”

Her: “I already did that! It’s colder than I want!”

Me: “Have you tried turning it up with the buttons?”

Her Majesty: “Why would I hit those buttons? I just want it warmer!”

These people are another breed I swear to God. 

Also, to clarify, it’s not like she was rude or anything, she just seems really bitter, and has complained about everything before even getting her keys.",10,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0BC6400>
388,Minister tried to get a discount without proper credentials,"My GM was working the desk when I got on today and she told me there was already a room on room watch. A guy from one of those prophetic apostolic churches tried to get a discount because he said he was a minister there. He didn't have a tax exempt form or nothing so no go on the discount. He was rude enough to get a room watch designation and the way my GM described him reminded me of a story that happened when I first started working in hospitality.

I was working in New Mexico and this guy, also a minister, checked in with a Pennsylvania DL which was strange enough as I never checked in anyone from PA up to that point. He asked for the price for a single bed and I quoted him the rate and during the check-in he mentioned he was with his wife which upped the rate slighty. 

Apparently he was offended by the rate increase and asked why I was charging him more. I told him the rate increases with additional adult guests. He said he was with his wife and that there should be no extra charge for that. I again explained our rate structure and he became more irate.

He said as she is his wife they should count as one person per religious convention. I told him we don't have a rate code for that and he went into God mode and tried to explain the bible to me. He said they are legally joined as a single person and we have to honor that. I told him our rates are based on X amount of adults. He went on for a bit and eventually left because our rate structure was ""of the world"".",23,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0BC6460>
389,Guest expects me to shovel their car out of the snow...,"We had a large snow storm for the last few days, so lots of cars that were parked on the street are snowed in due to the plows. The plow came through yesterday afternoon, so this guest's car had to have been sitting there for a couple of days. He comes to the desk, child in tow, and informed me about his car being snowed in. I apologize about the circumstance, and radio maintenance and ask if he has a shovel he can borrow. He then stares blankly and asks, ***""Um... So you guys aren't going to shovel my car out? I have to drop my son off.""*** I reply, ***""No, sir. That's not something we do. You're more than welcome to use our shovel, though.""*** Maintenance gives him a shovel and he leaves it in the middle of the street when he's done with it. I was going to give him complimentary access to our garage for the next few nights, but since he wants to be a jerk, he can continue to park in the snow. 🤷🏾‍♀️",105,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0BC64C0>
390,I'm not the FD you hoped for.,"A few months ago, I had an older man (70s?) Walk in and casually tell me that he was a GM for same ""GHI"" brand a state away (not in our franchise) 

I welcomed him as a friend of the brand, even offering a water. He then said that he gets ""A $30. rate every time he stays with ""GHI"" brand. Lowest rack rate for the night was 140.

I bit my tongue and eased my smirk while I asked him for his member number and if it had been set up beforehand.. and he just... hightailed it out the door, muttering loudly, ""I know where I'm not wanted.""

I couldn't suppress my laugh as he left. I was expecting more of an argument.

391,The other hotel would check me in,"I work the typical night audit shift and this happened a few months ago.

I had a guest wanting to check in and quote him a rate and told him I require a valid ID and a credit card. He said he had a credit card in his name but he just changed his license and was waiting for it in the mail and only had the temporary one (which is a yellow paper and good for upto a month until you receive your license in the mail). 

We require government issued photo ID but I understood what this guy was going through. I told him ""technically I require a government issued photo ID...""

I was not done when he interrupted me. What I was going to say is if the card goes through with a hold on chip and pin and you have anything with photo id (and I mean anything - Facebook, etc) I would have taken him in. But because HE THOUGHT HE KNEW WHAT I WAS GOING TO SAY, he automatically got his defense up.

Person looking for a room: ""Well The other hotel would check me in without proper ID"" with a tone in his voice. 

Yes, buddy and I was about to let you too, until you interrupted me and set off a huge RED FLAG to tell me that you are going to be an issue.

Me: ""Well then stay there."" In an apathetic voice

Person looking for a room: ""That is not customer friendly, I am going to send an email in the morning, what is your name.""

Me: ""ItsSwicky"" As I walk over to grab the managers card.

Person looking for a room: ""I need your managers card""

Me: ""thats what I was grabbing,"" gives guest the card, ""I appreciate you letting her know that I was following the Inn Keepers Act, it means I am doing my job.""

Person looking for a room: ""So what am I to do without proper ID, stay in my car overnight?""

Me: ""You just said 'the other hotel would check you in' so if that is true then I would recommend you go there, have a good night.""

The Person looking for a room stares at me then leaves. The funny thing is that I would have checked him in without ID if he actually let me finish my sentence but jumping the gun and assuming what I was going to say screwed himself over.

392,You just lost seven rooms! OH NO!,"So there I was yours truly on a slow afternoon when I get a phone call and it proceeds like this.

Me: (standard greeting)

Caller: Yes I'd like to book seven rooms for this evening.

Me: Sure, I'll put you thru to reservations

Caller: No No, I'm calling from ""travel agency"" (yes a travel agency with no name just travel agency) yes could I speak with your sales manager.

Me: I'm sorry they have already left for the day because of the impending weather. Again I'd be happy to put you thru to reservations.

Caller: Well can you call them back? I'd like to see if I could work out and included breakfast.

Me: Yeah again I'm sorry they left a half-hour ago. And I'm not authorized to make a block rate with breakfast included.

Caller: Can you call them and get authorization?

Me: No, I'm sorry sir im just a front desk agent and don't have access to do that.

Caller: Well you just lost seven rooms for tonight. (CLICK)

Oh no I lost seven rooms from someone who was trying to make a deal to get breakfast included and a lower rate. Which our mid-week rate is the lowest already!

393,Is this a new scam of some sort going around?,"I'm working the afternoon shift and just had an interesting call that sounded like it MIGHT be from a call center, but definitely not a quiet office and, unfortunately, it didn't sound like the agent spoke English as a first language and thats been connected to some blatant scams in the recent past, too. 

He was asking for the copy of a bill, he said he had spoken to a woman that morning (likely my direct supervisor) who gave him email contact information to get this invoice he wanted. He said the contact method failed and he still needed the invoice, now, since it sounded like a foreign call center, I immediately told him I could either send him to my supervisors voicemail or he could call back during normal business hours tomorrow. He was like ""but I have the information you need. Why can't you just look it up and fax me or send me a picture of it?"" Ummm, because I think you sound shady, my friend.   
I told him those were his two options and I'd transfer him. At this time, he disconnected and immediately called back, angry. 

""You were going to transfer me without my consent, thats not fucking customer service.""

I told him not to swear at me and the phone started ringing again, so I said, I'm sorry, I have other calls, please call back tomorrow. Goodbye. 

So, my manager and supervisor have been informed, but I'm wondering if any of you have encountered this and if its some sort of scam or just shady as all hell? Especially considering he swore at me, I don't think this place was legitimate, but I do know many 3rd parties work out of country. For reference, I'm in the USA.

394,The tale of the crack ninja,"I came into work last night; and the head of security stopped me;

Security: hey mundane, you hear what happened on Monday?

Me: (puzzled) was it about the laundry tickets that got thrown away?

Security: nope, about the crack ninja.

Me: crack ninja? What are you talking about? The only thing that was mentioned to me was that our evening shift lady threw away a bunch of laundry tickets and we don’t know what to charge the guest.

Security: oh boy (rubs his hands together like a kid in a candy shop that has a no limit candy spree in his future) have I got a video for you to watch!

So we go in the back office and he cues up the video. This lady comes in arms flailing every where talking a million miles a minute, the other auditor just stands there and listens for awhile. 

Lady wanders over to the coffee machine and helps herself, goes to the bathroom and then sits like a vibrating two year old who’s had too much caffeine. Auditor walks in the back office to presumably start paperwork. 

Lady sits there for five minutes, gets up walks in the back office, auditor tells her she can’t be back there, lady goes back up to the front and sits down. 

She sits there for maybe fifteen minutes then gets up and heads outside, about half an hour later she comes back in, through the employee only door. Night auditor has gotten up and gone to the kitchen to get some plates and utensils for her dinner, she’s gone maybe fifteen minutes with a stop on the way back to use the restroom.

In the time the auditor was not in the back office, this lady has proceeded to go through all the drawers and paperwork that isn’t locked up, and randomly grabs a flyer for a service we offer. Night auditor walks in sees her back there and has a brief conversation. Lady leaves the back office and walks out the front door. 

This lady then proceeds to walk back in through the employee door, walk by the office again and heads down to the restaurant, she starts riffling through all the menus and other assorted drawers and papers.

The night auditor then walks by on camera, this lady apparently heard her coming and so she ducks down behind the hostess station and presses her self against the wall. The auditor pauses, looks confused, shrugs and then gets herself a cup of coffee.

Night auditor heads back up to the front, and now the crack ninja is in the back of the bar next to the lotto machine. She sets down her stolen papers and steals(this part makes me so confused) the receipt paper from the lotto register.

She’s back there in the back screwing around when the beer delivery comes. So she hides under a shelf and waits 20 minutes for the delivery to be done.

He finishes up and leaves and the crack ninja walks to the bar and starts fiddling with the liquor cabinets. At this point the night auditor notices her on cam and goes down there tells her to leave, and escorts her to the front doors. 

This has already been a pretty wild ride as far as I’m concerned, I’m thinking it’s over right? Nope there’s more.

This lady comes in the back door of the restaurant, she proceeds to hide out in one of the banquet rooms. She’s in there for probably an hour when the next delivery comes in, it’s food this time. Guy drops it where he usually does and leaves.

She sneaks out of the banquet room, sees someone in the restaurant and retreats almost immediately. She waits five minutes and then walks back out grabs the packing list and goes back to her hideout.

Half an hour passes and she’s back out next to the delivery we just got, she carefully moves two boxes off the top, and takes the third on with her, this box is filled with cheese cake.

I’m told she ate all the cheese cake and then used the wrappers to smear words all over the banquet room walls.

One of our bussers always checks the banquet rooms to make sure they are set up for any party’s that are coming in, lady finally gets caught and once again gets thrown out and the cops are called. Well lady decides she’s not waiting for the police, she walks across the street to a car that a high school kid has just turned on and left running to warm up before he drives to school, this lady hops in it and drives away. 

She then proceeded to trash the truck, and head for some good old mac ds, which is where the police caught her.

In the trashed vehicle there is a bloody knife, it’s not her blood.

So by the time this whole saga is done I’m thinking, jeez man at least she’s in jail, and won’t be my problem.

Nope, security calls me at 2am to tell me he just ran in to her at a gas station on the other side of town.

I locked the doors and just sighed. She never came by so at least there’s that I guess.",57,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0BC66A0>
395,Frequent Guest's Noise Complaint leads to me calling the Police,"Here I am covering *another* audit shift. Anyways.

The night starts as normal, I have a few stragglers from the bar heading upstairs, and I start my pre-audit reports. Then I get a call.

One of our Super Shiny members is complaining about the noise on our top floor. No problem, right on it.

I shoot up the elevator, and in our top floor lounge, there are two people sitting on the couch, snuggling in front of the TV, speaking at the TOP of their voices, with the volume super high. I sigh, and approach them.

OP: ""Hey, can you guys keep it down, people are trying to sleep""

Big Bitch (now BB for short): ""Mind your own business""

OP: ""Just, please turn down the volume.""

I turn, and walk down the hallway, looking for another source of any loud noise. But it's just the TV, and this horrible woman's high pitched, very loud voice. 

The volume on the TV hadn't changed at all, but she had gotten louder. With a sigh, I return back to the lounge, and again approach them, this time standing in front of the TV.

OP: ""Guys, it's after midnight. Can you please keep it down? People are trying to sleep""

BB: ""Stop bothering us, we are free to be up here. Go back down stairs, you fucking asshole""

OP: ""Your volume is WAYYY too high guys, this is a final warning. Be respectful""

BB: ""You're not the fucking police, leave us alone""

OP: ""Do I need the police for this? Are you a guest here? What room are you in, because you've clearly had enough to drink, so it's time for bed""

BB: ""Yeah I'm a guest here. 414. And I'm not going to say it again, leave us alone""

OP: \*Turning to the Frequent guest (FG)\* ""Is she with you? Can you guys please return to your room? Or is she really not with you? Because, if that's the case, I have half a mind to have her escorted off property""

FG: \*Just shrugs, and starts to get up\*

OP: ""Alright, well if she isn't with you, then she needs to leave. Miss, go back to your room. I wont ask again.""

I go back down to the lobby, and check in my system what this lady's name is. Nothing in 414, or any near by rooms. Odd. The phone rings again, yet another complaint about noise. 

I pop back up there, and the TV is turned down, but she is talking Super loud. I walk up, and start looking for the power button.

OP: ""Alright, I've had enough. You aren't a guest here, I checked. you need to leave."" \*I reach for the remote in front of her\*

BB: ""DONT YOU FUCKING TOUCH ME, IM CALLING MY BOSS""

OP \*Confused\* : ""Feel free, but you need to leave. Do I need to get the police involved, or are you going to leave on your own?""

BB: ""Call the police, I'm not going anywhere.""

FG: \*whispering to her\* ""C'mon, lets go to bed""

OP: ""Alright, lets do it your way"" \*dials 911, and heads back to the lobby\*

Cops arrive quickly, and I take them back up. She is nowhere in sight, but FG is standing outside of his door, almost guarding it. The police and I walk the floor, and FG starts following us. We decide to go to the 4th floor, just because she had mentioned a room there. We get into the elevator, and FG steps in with us. 

We get to 4, and the police officer asks me who she was last with, I let them know that she was with FG. The officer starts asking FG a question, and FG just loses it. He starts berating the police, and being a total jerk. I bring us down to the lobby, where apparently two more officers were waiting. 

FG rushes out side, and the officers follow. I return to the desk, and just roll my eyes, wishing I had called out today.

The police come back, and want to walk the top floor again. FG *AGAIN* jumps into the elevator with us (I am escorting the police per policy), and starts following them around. 

Turns out, this lady is likely FG's prostitute (though that is not confirmed, just an implication from the police). I let the police know that, simply, if it is quiet, then that's all it needed to be, and that if she shows back up, I would let them know.

We return to the lobby, and within seconds, FG comes to the desk and starts berating me. I stand up for myself, and let him know that maintaining the building's security is my job at night, and as far as we knew, she was just walking around because FG did not admit she was with him. I let him know that this was a really escalated, and frankly stupid solution to this problem, and that they should have just turned down the TV, or returned to his room. That he shouldn't have gotten involved with the police at all, but that he made it so much more difficult for himself.

He demands my business card, and every manager's business card. He asks for me last name (I don't give that out to anyone, a bad past experience). He gets all riled up, and tells me that he's going to make sure I get fired. The police even told him to back off and go upstairs. 

I call my general manager, waking him up, and let him know what happened, that it escalated, but I did not instigate, and that it got out of control. I sent out an Email to everyone also, informing them of what happened. 

Personally, I would love the vacation time in being fired. Doesn't sound like that's what my manager wants though.",30,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0BC6700>
396,Don't let your drunk family get you fired,"For context, there's Me - NightWarac, OM - a person using an employee discount and claims she's an Operations Manager where she works, DG - Really drunk girl with OM, and OMSis - OM's sister.

I see OM entering the lobby basically carrying DG. She plops DG down in one of my lobby chairs and comes to the desk being super drunk loud needing a key. She says OMS has her id, but then starts to spout off all kinds of personal information at the top of her lungs. I advise her to quiet down, then attempt to ask a few questions to id her. I ask for email address, she tells me the hotel she works at. I ask for zip code, I get her phone #. I let her know this will go much better for everyone if she pays attention to the question I'm asking. I finally get her info and giver her a key. As she walks back to DG, we both see DG is now on her hands and knees in my lobby. OM starts yelling at her super loudly so I go over tell her to quiet down them address DG. I ask if she's OK, I get a grunt. I advise her if she cannot stand up, I would need to call paramedics. She gets to her feet with OM's help and they head off to the elevator. I wait about 30 seconds then jump in another elevator and head up. A full floor below theirs, I hear OM yelling at DG to get up. As I get off the elevator, I tell OM to shut up, pickup her friend (Who's knelling in a puddle of vomit) and get to their room. They manage to make it to their room and I head off for cleaning supplies. I come back to the puddle to find OM trying to clean it up, in tears saying she's an operations manager where she works and doesn't want to get fired. I assure her she's not getting fired for this, just go to her room and in the future don't let your friend drink so much.

About 45 minutes later I get a call from a guest stating there is a man and woman banging on doors and being really loud in the hallway. I head up and find a guy and girl laying on the floor outside of a room I know is vacant. I advise them to quiet down, and that they can't lay in my hallway and ask what room their in. The girl starts yelling that's she's an elite member, we can't treat her like this, she's going to have me fired, etc... I finally find out she's in a room with her sister, OM. I try explaining to OMSis that she's on the wrong floor but she's having none of it. She continues to bang on the wrong door getting louder and louder. I advise her if she didn't come with me I'd call the police and she'd be removed from the hotel. She doesn't care, so now I've got officers coming. The guy is just some rando she met out drinking, I advise him if he's still here when the police arrive, he gets a free trespass form as well. He decided the smart move was to leave.

While waiting for the police, OMSis is screaming how she's going to have me fired, her Daddy owns the hotel, even a few ""I'll smack the shit out of you"". (FYI, she's 5 foot and maybe 110lbs, I'm 6'1"", 280lbs and while I don't like to hit women, you strike me and I'll return the favor). At one point OMSis decided to go down to the lobby (possibly looking for another employee to assist, bad luck I'm the only one here.) Just as we hit the lobby in walks an officer who takes her outside. He eventually gets her to leave, having given her the official trespass paperwork and almost arresting her as she threatened to smack the shit out of the responding officers and advises me to call if she comes back.

30ish minutes go by and OMSis come back through the front doors looks at me and starts to yell loudly how my co-worker is an asshole, and she's getting him fired. I'm already on the phone with 911 and as I get in the elevator with her she realizes I was the previous asshole. the 911 dispatcher can hardly hear me over her yelling how she'll again get me fired, she'll smack the shit out of me, her Daddy owns the hotel and everyone's getting fired, yadda, yadda, yadda.

This time, she goes to the correct room, and attempts to slam the door in my face. Sadly for her, I'm holding the door open with my foot. I speak to OM to advise her police were on the way and when they get here OMSis is most likely heading to jail. OMSis starts yelling that we left her with some rando guy and she could have been raped. (The same rando I found her with earlier apparently.)

Police arrive and make contact. When they return to the front desk, they advise me I could have her arrested, but she's so intoxicated the jail would refuse her and they'd end up transporting her to the hospital instead. Also, OM has assured the officers OMSis is going straight to sleep and they'll be no more problems. Silly me I agree to let her sleep it off in the room, knowing in the am we were kicking the 3 of them out.

25ish minutes go by and I get a call from the rom next to OM about people yelling and arguing. I call OM and advise her this was enough, I'm getting complaints. She begs and again assures me they're all going to bed right now, they'll be no more issues. Again, I let my better side agree to let them stay.

20ish minutes go by and another call from the room next door saying it sounds like people are through things at the wall. 

NOW I'M FULLY DONE. I head up, bang on the door and OM answers. I advise her she and her friends have 10 minutes to be at my front desk with all of their belongings and room keys, or the police will be coming again, and not only will all 3 end up trespassed, I'll insist the police take OMSis for disturbing the peace and trespass after warning. She tries to apologize but I cut her off saying 10 minutes and return to the desk. A few minutes later OMSis walks by the desk with her belongings and leaves. I actually give OM 15 minutes then head back up to the room. OM and DG are now playing the slow pack stalling game, hoping since I saw OMSis leave I'll just forget about them. Nope, police get called (3rd time). OM and DG come to the desk about 15 minutes later (right before the police arrive). As OM goes to leave I say to her ""Originally I was going to call your GM and ask them to talk to you about keeping control of your people when you travel using the employee discount. But since you decided to play games at the end, I'll be filing a formal complaint with Warriott corporate and your hotels management company. Pretty sure you're about to be without a job."" She just looks at me and walks out.

I go up re-key the room door and check out the room. There was small damage to the wall and the room was trashed, but not enough to take it out of circulation.

A bit later a couple of police officers come in and say OM called them stating we have her Iphone. I check our lost and found and nothing's listed, I also let them know I was just in the room and no phone was left there.

So, about an hour later, I take a walk outside on our front patio and there's OM casually sitting there. I'm just stunned. I advise her I will call the police for the 4th time if I see her or her friends anywhere on the property again. She runs her mouth but does leave.

TLDR; Girl rents a room using the employee discount, proceeds to have her sister and a friend get so drunk I end up calling the police 3 times, sister almost gets arrested for threating to smack the shit out of the police, end up kicking them all out and the girl who rented the room is going to lose her job because of their behavior.",28,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0BC6760>
397,"It doesn't matter how many times you ask, the answer is the same.","I'm two hours into my audit and I've gotten six phone calls from the same lady and her boyfriend.  They keep calling about a monthly rate.  First it was her.  I told her we don't have weekly or monthly rates, but you get a big reduction in your nightly rate for extended stays.  I tell her it comes to 99 dollar a night, plus tax, unless you stay for 31 days, then you are tax exempt in our state.  


Then the boyfriend calls.  I explain the same thing to him.  


Then she calls.  I explain it one more time, using the old ""as I said the last time you called"" line.  


Then they call together.  I explain YET AGAIN what we charge and they call me a slur and hang up.  


Now they have called yet again, together, yelling at me and demanding I charge less because ""another hotel will cost us this but we want to stay there.""   


I told them as nicely as possible ""We don't do rate matching.  If you don't want to pay our rates, stay at the other hotel.  Otherwise, the rate here is 99 dollars a night if you stay for 30 days.  Please do not call me again unless you would like to book."" and hung up.",31,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0BC67C0>
398,Request for a compensations because of inconvenience,"Hey guys, I just wanted to share a short story.

So I checked this lady in earlier tonight. Her reservation was through a third party (hotel tonight) You get the cheapest rate booking through this app, but the only down side is that you get the most basic room. 

Like usual, I greeted her when checking her in, and gave her a free upgrade to a King size room because she looked tired and I wanted to give her a good sleep. Everything went smoothly, until 15 minutes later she got to the room and started giving us phone calls after phone calls about missing items in the room.
It wasn’t anything major, like a bath mat and hair dryer. Well, easy, I apologized and have the house man brought it up to her right away. She was complaining how it inconvenient for her that they didn’t bring up fast enough and had to wait. Our hotel is not that busy, but our houseman doesn’t have super-speed, they have to travel from basement to basement to get the items.
Yes I get it, our housekeeper missed some items sometimes, but they are human too. 

She called down the front desk later to asked for any compensations or discount, and was making the issue bigger than it was. Yes , its the hotel’s fault that we didn’t have those items ready in the room when she checked in. Now I feel like I shouldn’t have given her a free upgrade in the beginning. Im sure there will be a review from her after her stay 🙄.

I literally thought I’d never post here because I really did like working front desk at this small motel at first, but the last few months have taken a toll on me. The place I work at is really close to that rat-infested theme park. It’s small (it has less than 70 rooms) and, while most people are great, I’ve had so many bad experiences getting yelled & cussed at for things that aren’t my fault. Also, the other front desk people suck at their jobs (with the exception of my friend). This stupid place also has so many internal problems & can’t keep staff very long (hmm, I wonder why?) & the way it’s being managed is horrendous. We don’t have enough staff to be fully-booked, frankly, and yet we are nearly everyday. Anyways, my coworker sent me this text & all it did was confirm how much I hate this job: 

Rm 106 called me asking if I can ask the people above them to stop their kid from jumping up and down bc they’re tryna get their baby to sleep. When I called 106, they were like “I would but we’re trying to have fun right now and that’s not really my problem. I didn’t complain when the room next to us were having sex and woke us up in the middle of the night, it goes both ways”

I cannot wait to leave.",13,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0BC6880>
400,McDonalds called and asked me to pick up my patient,"About 4 days ago I checked in a woman who said she was renting a room for her brother who is handicapped and in a wheelchair. I said no problem we'll just need his ID so I can add him to the guest list. It was a standard check-in and she said he won't be a problem he'll just need help here and there and if I need to we can call her directly at any time. Yeah.

So the first night was uneventful and the sister was in his room for about an hour then left. The next day the guest called me around 5pm and said his HVAC unit was blowing cold air. I told him np just push the heat button and adjust the temp with the up/down buttons. He gave me a long sigh and said he can't do it he needs my help and he's handicapped. I said OK sir I understand however all you need to do is push the heat button and adjust the temp--standard--and he said ""But I CAN'T do it I'm handicapped I need your help!""

I go up and the unit is set to heat and is at 70 degrees. I tell him it is on heat and would he like me to turn it up. He said yes he's freezing. I try to prompt him to come over and show him how to adjust the temp but he just sat there. I turned it up to 75 and left.

About an hour later he called and said his TV had no picture. I told him to press the input button on his remote and change it to cable and he said he couldn't do it he needed my help. I asked him to get his remote and tried to explain the procedure again and he interrupted me and said ""I can't do it I'm handicapped I need YOUR help!"" Ok, so I go and do that and try to show him out to change the input and he did nothing.

Later that day he apparently ordered pizza and gave the wrong room # so the delivery guy left the pizza at the desk. I called the room and told him his pizza was here at the desk and he said he couldn't get it because yeah. So I take it to his room and not 10 minutes later he strolls down to the breakfast area with the pizza and asks me to turn on the tv. Luckily I can do that from the desk so I did. He was there for about 2 hours which was fine he wasn't bothering anyone. However, he didn't bother to clean up after himself.

He did that for a couple of days with food his sister brought and I honestly didn't mind cleaning up after him after he was done watching TV in the breakfast area. I just let him be and do his thing. He's called on and off for things he ~~can~~ can't do per usual.

Today however he decided to go to McDonalds which is a block away. An hour later McDonalds called the hotel and asked for someone to pick up our ""patient"". I was confused as we're not a health care facility and I told her that and she said theres a guy in the lobby that won't leave and he's in a wheelchair and his name is so and so. I said yes we do have a guest who's staying with us who matches that description and she said he wants to watch TV as he eats his food but they don't have one in their lobby and he won't leave and someone needs to pick him up now.

I called his sister and she didn't answer. It's been busy today and I'm the only one at the desk so I kept calling and no answer every time. Meanwhile I'm checking in guests and McDonalds calls again and its the manager who says if someone doesn't pick our guest up soon they will call the police. Our guest has 3 more days on his reservation and I don't want any issues with rent blah blah blah so I put up our Be Back In 10 Minutes sign and run to McDonalds and bring him back. 

I'm taking him to his room and hes No no no he wants to eat in the breakfast area. OK fine. I called his sister again and left a lengthy voicemail about what happened and that I'm not doing that again.",226,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0B34520>
401,"Welp, We've Got the Mace On the Desk Now...","I mean, we've had it hidden in the drawer, but now it's just sitting out on the desk. I came in today, and the shift exchange was just a warning that because some guy threatened to beat the shit out of my boss (if she'd been a man, like that makes any of this okay). He smoked in our non-smoking hotel. That's supposed to be an automatic $250 fine. She charged him $150.

 This isn't something we do lightly. There has to be solid evidence. We're generally pretty chill. If the room just smells like smoke, we don't generally charge (don't take that as advice, because most hotels will take that as hard enough evidence). Usually when we charge the fine, it's because we've found a cigarette butt in a cup or something. 

This guy had the gall to call up the hotel, and threaten violence over $150 when he knew it was a non-smoking room. It's on the sign on the door. As if the absence of an ashtray wasn't enough of a hint. So, yes, there's a fee, dude.

Anyway, as a result, we're keeping the mace on the desk, just in case he decides to come in, and beat up someone who does have a dick.",98,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0B34490>
402,"If You’re Squatting, Protip: Don’t Piss Off the Police","This will be a quicker tale.

For about a year we have had a long term stay couple here at the Legal Garden.  For most of the year, they were good with payment.

Even before the subsequent issues, the guests were a bit sketchy.  While far from the worst, they did look a bit methy, and we thought they might be addicts or entrepreneurs of some sort.

This eventually changed to them booking late, but still booking for the night in question, although not until 9-11 pm.  They had stayed for several months by now, and as occupancy has been so low, it was permitted.

Eventually, they stopped making reservations, but would still eventually settle  after a day or two when we started to nag them for payment.  As of writing though, they have stopped paying, and we have started the slow eviction process.

Until recently, the only positive thing is that we have refused to help with any issues they are having with the room until they settle their balance.

Cut to the other day when the one of the guests said there would be a problem if we didn’t fix their TV.

Later that day, or the following day(I was off), the police show up asking about one of the guests.

It turns out, someone matching their description broke into a car at the housing complex next door.  Not only that, but the car belonged to one of the last people you would want to rob- the wife of a police sergeant.  Yes, the car owners have cameras.

Obviously they want to press charges.

Last night the police showed up again looking for him, but, to my knowledge, nothing has happened yet.

So it looks like the eviction will take less than the six months we were expecting.",22,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0BC6AF0>
403,Guest with Car Batteries???,"My fiance and I had the opportunity to pick up and move across the country with a GM that I had worked with at 3 other properties prior to this one. My GM and I had a mentorship relationship so everytime he would get with a new company, he would bring me with. I worked with him all the way from Florida to Indiana to New Mexico. The New Mexico property was quite an interesting one to say the least.

I had accepted the AGM role while my fiance accepted a position in laundry. When we first got to the hotel, things were great! I was enjoying my staff and the clients we would get at this property and it was pretty quick turn around with being by an airport. But the beginning of my time there isn't why I'm writing to you all. I'm writing to you about the downhill and why I'm no longer there 😂.

So about 5 months into the position is when the red flags begin to appear. We had a guest report their car stolen from the parking garage one night, which was unusual giving we had a gated garage that you need a key card to access. My GM refused to go through the footage and told the guest to have the police come in for it due to privacy concerns. My GM also had told me that I needed to email the guest and explain that there are signs in the garage stating that we are not liable for damages or theft. 

But that's where it just starts. Literally 20 minutes after I got done emailing the guest I went upstairs to inspect rooms for housekeeping. One of the vacant dirty rooms were suddenly latched from the inside. My fob wouldn't open the door and it was deadbolted, and the housekeeper was downstairs grabbing a new duvet. She came back upstairs while I was outside the room, and I had thought she was in the room using the bathroom or something. But no. She had no idea anyone was in the room.

I could hear movement in the room. I knew someone was in there, so I knocked and told them we needed to know who was in the room. At first we were thinking it was a guest checked into a not ready room, but that wasn't the case. Suddenly the door opens about a foot and the guy looks at me and asks why I'm bothering him and he starts to raise his voice and get pissed. I explained to him that there wasn't anyone checked into the room and housekeeping wasn't finished with the room. I could see around the door and the bed is literally stripped down to the mattress pad. 

He started listing off a bunch of random names of people who were working the desk that checked him in, but none of the names matched any of our staff. I start thinking he's at the wrong hotel and he insists he's with us. I stepped down the hallway at this point, and called the police for some help resolving this issue. 

THIS DUDE HEARD ME CALL THE POLICE. AND HE FLIPPED. He came out of the room and ran at me down the hallway WITH A CAR BATTERY IN HIS HAND. He stopped me at the stairwell and handed me the car battery then said it was super important and then he just ran out of the hotel out of the stairs. Like what? Why did you just hand me a car battery? 

Fast forward to when the police got to the hotel. They walked through the room and found needle caps and a SECOND car battery. I had given the police the first one but they wouldn't take it and told us to just dispose of it however we needed to, and they left the other one in the room. Police weren't any help. 

Everything got quiet for a couple of days until this guy made another appearance. Our hotel was set up with the back hallway going straight to the dumpster area, and my office was in that hallway. The dumpster door never liked to latch, and would get stuck open from time to time. This guy walked through the dumpster door, right passed my office door with a bunch of our Sysco boxes in his hand. I got up and followed him and asked what he was doing, and he said he was dropping off a delivery.

I told him, when dropping off packages you use the lobby doors. And then asked him for the boxes back because I knew he had just picked them up from the back hall. This is the point that he tells me that the packages aren't for me, but for someone else. I just told him I was calling the police again, and he left WITH OUR BOXES. He took all of our gloves for the restaurant 😒. 

When I went home that night, I saw this guy sitting on the curb at the gas station 3 blocks down the road with the boxes sitting right beside him. I pulled by and yelled out my window that the police are coming and that I told them where he was at the gas station. I didn't actually call the cops again because they had been no help the entire time. Just wanted to scare him a little. But this backfired.

I got back to the hotel the next day for my shift and all was fine until it was time to go home. Somehow this guy had gotten into our parking garage and left a smaller car battery (maybe a moped one) sitting beside my car. I was sketched out because when I saw the battery I knew exactly who had put it there. I got in my car and just left it in on the ground. I didn't want to touch it, but when I was pulling out this battery guy ran out from behind another car right in front of mine and I had to stop. He started screaming that next time he saw me he was going to throw battery acid in my face. 

That was the point I was done, I just pulled off and went home and called in yet another police report. And yet again, they did nothing. This guy would always disappear before they would get there. Always. I swear he knew his way around the property more than I did with how sneaky he was. There was no record of him ever being a guest either, but I'm sure it was a fake name he gave us during the first incident. The next day, I went in and packed up my office and just left and moved back home to Indiana. New Mexico is a crazy place.",59,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0BC6D00>
404,Renovations are killing me,"Just needed to vent about some of the many issues my hotel's renovation is causing.

So we've been under construction since late October 2021 and we're maybe halfway done? We're a 4 floor hotel and they've got the upper 2 floors ""done,"" now working on the bottom 2. Thankfully the lobby is decently presentable atm and we have our hot breakfast back so there's not too many more guest complaints, but there are still other issues. 

There's so much mess to clean every day and the lobby just always looks dirty. It's exhausting having to sweep and dust and mop 4 to 5 times a shift at least. Not to mention the noise from drills and the like while I'm trying to take reservations over the phone. I feel so bad having to ask the guest over and over to repeat themselves because I can't hear anything. It was even worse when they were tearing up the floor, you couldn't even hear the phone ring, but thankfully they're done with that. Then theres the fact that we're supposedly ""remodeling"", but none of the equipment we've been having issues with for years is getting replaced. So we're going to have this brand new looking hotel with the exact same issues we've been continuing to have for ages now.

My biggest gripe tonight specifically is the new TVs, one of the few electrical appliances that is actually getting replaced. We used to have a dresser/TV stand that they would sit on which made troubleshooting and fixing them relatively simple. They weren't stuck to anything so you could easily turn them for easier access or shine a flashlight behind them to actually see what you were doing. 

The new TVs we have are wall mounted which is already causing tons of issues. Sure they look sleek and everything is nice and dandy when they're working, but as soon as something goes wrong with them that's when it goes to shit. They are firmly attached to the wall with no kind of movement possible and they're fairly high on the wall. This makes it nearly impossible to unplug/plug anything into them. They've also stuck the cable box on the top of the wall mount making it almost impossible to get to that either. Anytime I have to reset the cable box I have to climb up onto the little cabinet below the TV to even be able to see the box. God forbid I have to unplug the HDMI cable or the power cord to the TV. I can't even shine a light back there to see what I'm doing, and even if I could I wouldn't be able to fit my arm back there as the TVs are practically flush with the wall.

It's just been infuriating trying to help guests out with TV related issues especially with all the other smaller renovation related problems piling up as well. I just needed somewhere to dump all my frustrations and stress about all this. Thanks for listening, this community has really been there for me and helped me out when dealing with bad guest interactions or tough situations. I really appreciate all of you ♡",13,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0C57910>
405,Front desk struggling to grasp the concept of prepaids.,"Hey guys I know we love to complain about Karen’s but I want to just vent and needless to say, I’m irritated at how things were handled and how it gone thrown onto me to fix.

So we had this online reservation pop up from a 3rd party and lord behold- it’s a prepaid!! 

I actually was the person to work on it and make sure it was setup correctly before the guest checks in… so that way they won’t see the rates and know we’re only asking for incidentals.

Apparently after I work on it, the guest himself decides to extend and the third party updated his reservation, making us needing to work on it again.

This time my coworker was the lucky person to work on the prepaid reservation. She entirely messed it up- completely disregarded my notes that specifically pointed out that it’s a prepaid and a virtual card must be charged the day of check in before arrival of guest.

That’s when my coworker checked the guest in and experienced the virtual card issue.

She was asking the guest if he can show us his bank statements and see if he’s actually paid for the room. She tells the guest all about the virtual card process and he’s confused. He sees his reservation and his charge is drastically different from what we charge the virtual card.

I had to butt in and tell her not to explain to him what’s a virtual card and just check him in and we’ll handle it. She continues to talk to the guest.

“Sir, it’s not fair that we’re charging $381 for your stay and (third party name) charged your card $1,260 before checking in”

The guest agrees with my coworker and he’s super upset that she’s asking him to look up his confirmation, his charges and needing to call the third party. 

“I just want to get into my room and it feels like I’m doing all the work for you”

I tell my coworker to just check him in, apologize and we’ll handle the situation. I tell her we need to call the third party.

My coworker complains that she doesn’t want to call the 3rd party and left the call for me to do

As much as I tried to reach their 24/7 phone number, it’s just a bot and it’s not much help.",40,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0C579A0>
406,Customer poses as high tier and asks if they can have their items for free,"Someone suggested I post this here from another reddit, so here I am!

I may return to post more stories here, as I have plenty of drama working front desk, just usually not in the entitled way.

This is gonna be a short story. Not really
much to it, but it seemed entitled, and I honestly don't experience entitlement that much(especially like this).

I work at a hotel, and our hotel has a rewards system where the more stays you have, the higher rank you have. My hotel also is host to many sports teams on the weekends, which is when I normally work, and I work night shift. 
I was busy at the front desk of the hotel, when this couple came along to the desk. They seemed like they were in a hurry to get back to their room, so I wasn't gonna try to waste their time, but they had gotten stuff from our market place. The man in the couple looked like he was going to keep walking to his room with the woman, but stopped and came back to the desk when he noticed me. He had a few items in his hands from our hotel market, probably worth $10-15 in total. He quickly asks me,""Hey. We're high ranking members for your hotel rewards. Do we have to pay for these?"" I remember taking a second of silence and feeling my eyes widen and blink with surprise. Who just asks like that if they don't have to pay for a bunch of items because of a rewards title? Of course I said,""Yes, you do."" The couple seemed a but down that I slowed their progress to their room, and reluctantly paid for their items. 
After they had paid and left, I looked up to see what their rewards status was, and, low and behold, they were actually one of the lowest rankings in out rewards system. I guess they had read about the rankings well enough when signing up to know what they were, but didn't actually know what they gave or did further than that. Although this was not serious entitlement, I still found it odd they had the audacity to pose as a high rank, and then ask for a bunch of free stuff.",28,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0C57A00>
407,Idiot and his Friend,"Usual night shift going smoothly and wondering how it's been a while since we had a major incident. Enter the idiot and his in house friend.


Me: Good evening sir. How can I be of assistance

Mr Dick: I am staying with you guys and wanted to book a room. My friend here already stays with you so give me the lowest rate and a room next to him

Me: Sure we have availability on the same floor . But first I request you to wear a mask.

Mr Dick: Why should I? 

Me: Covid cases are increasing in the state and we have to take precautions 

Mr Dick: I have a negative covid report from yesterday. Do you want to see that? 

Me: No, just wear a mask please

Mr Dick: I am not going to wear a mask you asshole. Give me my room keys

Me: Sorry what did you call me? 

Mr Dick: Can't you hear me Asshole? Give me my keys 

Me: Sorry to inform you that because of your abusive language i will not be making a new reservation for you. And any reservation you make, I will cancel. Please leave. 


The friend tries to reason with me, says that Mr Dick is drunk. And then says he's a famous hockey player and we should be respectful and lucky that he's staying with us. 

Told him that it doesn't matter who he is and since he's used abusive language we don't need to provide service. 

At this point Mr Dick approaches me and starts screaming the usual ""Do you know who I am and what I can do to you asshole?"" 

I looked him in the eyes and replied with a casual ""I don't care"" 

This set his anger off and he came to hit me. Was pulled back by security team and his friend. I didn't flinch. Just stood there and looked at him being escorted out of the property while he screamed ""I'll kill you"". Just gave him a thumbs up and carried on. 

Ah night shifts. Got to love them",59,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0C57A60>
408,Overheard at the Front Desk This Morning,"Remembering as much of this conversation as I can…

Setting: Nice Hotel on Florida Gulf Coast 

F- Fantastic Front Desk Lady
A - Annoying Guy

F - Good morning, how can I help you?

A- Do you have any razors?

F - I’ll check in the back. Do you need anything else?

A- No, that’s it.

F  returns with the razor.  Here you are, sir

A- Oh, do you have shaving cream?

F - I’ll go back and grab some. Do you need anything else.

A- What do you have?

F- combs, tooth brushes, toothpaste, shampoo and conditioner.

A consults with his wife for a few minutes before they decide that they would like two of everything. Meanwhile, the line of people behind this guy wanting to check out continues to grow.

F returns with A’s pile of freebies and I thought the show was over. But, since this is Tales from the Front Desk, you know it wasn’t.

A- (leaning onto the counter like he was settling in awhile) So, you told that person on the phone that you have open rooms tonight. Can I get a better rate for tonight because of that?

F- I’m afraid not, sir.

A- Well can you check?

F- Can I have your rewards number?

A- I don’t have one. Can you sign me up?

So while she is doing this, there are about 10 people in line. She announces that they could just put their room keys in the basket on the counter but no one took her up on it. Five minutes later, A is all signed up.

A- Now can you change my rate?

F  - Sir you are already receiving the best rate, I’m sorry.

A- Then why did you make me sign up for your program? Now I’m going to get a bunch of spam email.  I’m going to need corporate’s number. 

F gives him a card and asks if there will be anything else as the line grows and grumbling is heard.

A- As long as I’m here, can you give me an itemized bill?

F - since you just checked in yesterday, we don’t have an itemized bill

A- well I need to know what I spent so far so I need an itemized bill

F busied herself at her computer for a few minutes and printed out something and handed it to him.  He studied it for several minutes.

F - anything else I can do for you sir?

A- Yes. Is there a jet ski rental around here

F- There are several 

A- Which one has the best prices?

F - I don’t jet ski, so I’m afraid I don’t know but you could call and ask.

A- I don’t really have time for that

Pause
Pause 
Pause

F- Can I help you with anything else?  (Line is now maybe 15 people deep)

A- What do you think about Naples? Is it worth checking out? 

F- Um, yes it’s a nice little town 

A- What is there to do there? I’ve been to Florida 19 times but I’ve never been to Naples.

At that point, I exited the now-full lobby hoping the front desk agent has a big margarita waiting for her after work.",69,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0C57AC0>
409,Alcohol and 1:59 AM,"*(as usual, any names of guests or properties mentioned are aliases for privacy reasons.)*

I work at a motel in California. We have a snackbar in the lobby that sells chips, sodas, and most importantly in the context of this sale, alcohol. Thankfully the fridge that the alcohol is stored in required a staff key to open.

So in comes this guest, around 12:15 AM. We'll call him Chad Boozebastard.

Chad isn't wearing a mask, so I ask him to please put one on, and then he comes back with a mask on. Then he says he wants to buy some beer. As per the usual routine when selling alcohol, I ask to see his ID and he leaves for his room. I assume it won't be long, but after five minutes he's not back so I just continue on with my shift as normal.

He eventually comes back...at 1:59 AM. I definitely remember from seeing the taskbar clock on the front desk PC.

I see him fishing through his poorly-organized cards, likely trying to find his ID and ask him if he's still trying to buy booze, to which he says yes. *You mean to tell me that in the 1 1/2 hours you were gone, you still couldn't have your ID in your hand and ready to present at the front desk?*

Time for a little lesson in California alcohol laws!

> **[B & P Code 25631. Retail Hours of Sale](https://www.abc.ca.gov/education/merchant-education/on-sale-licensee-informational-guide/hours-of-sale/)**
>
> Any on-sale or off sale licensee, or agent or employee of that licensee, who sells, gives, or delivers to any persons any alcoholic beverage or any person who knowingly purchases any alcoholic beverage **between the hours of 2 o’clock a.m. and 6 o’clock a.m.** of the same day, is guilty of a misdemeanor.

I tell him unfortunately, we are now closed to alcohol sales because we do not sell alcohol between 2-6 AM, but he isn't having it.

> **Chad:** It's 1 minute to 2.
>
> **Rin:** Unfortunately that isn't enough time to process this transaction.
>
> **Chad:** *(pointing to the wall clock)* One minute to 2.
>
> **Rin:** It's now 5 seconds to 2. *(points to the seconds hand on the clock, which is now at the 55 seconds position.)*

Now granted, this wall clock doesn't sync with any major time institute, and therefore could be some seconds or even a few minutes off, and the Windows clock still showed 1:59 AM. But I wasn't about to take my chances. I would have needed to pull up the property management software, and then posted the charge and the payment before the clock struck 2:00:00 AM, because if either transaction was timestamped as at or after 2 AM, something that my GM would be able to easily trace, both Chad and I would be committing a crime. 

He then left afterwards, salty that he couldn't get me to sell him alcohol at an illegal hour. He didn't seem drunk to me, his breath smelled normal, but I still don't think he's a responsible drinker.

Anyways thank you for calling the F.O.E. Motel, how may I help you today?",25,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0C57B20>
410,You should remember who I am!!,"This happened about a year ago now. A guest came up to my desk and asked for a new room key cause he lost his. Conversation goes,

Guest: “I need a new key, I lost mine.”

Me: “I’d be happy to! May I just see you ID first?”

G: “Why the hell do you need to see my ID?”

Me: “Well I just have to make sure it matches the name on file, it’s a safety issue”

G: “this is ridiculous! I’ve been staying here for a week! You should know who I fucking am by now!”

Me: “well I don’t, and if you want a key you’ll have to show me your ID first.”

He grovels, shows me the ID and is on his way. But here’s the kicker. My roommate had gotten Covid, and cause I was exposed to him I had been in quarantine for 2 weeks. This was my first day back. So this asshat was screaming at me for not having every single guest memorized when he didn’t recognize the fact that I hadn’t been there during his week long stay.",26,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0C57B80>
411,Just saw a scam I hadn't seen before,"A guy walks in and asks for a room with two queen beds. I quote the rate and he agrees. 

I ask for his card and ID, he hands a red debit card issued by a well known bank and his ID. The names on the ID and card match so I proceed with the check in process. 

I input all of his information, and when I ask for an email he declines. Whenever a walk in declines giving any information I add their ID number to the notes in case we have issues. 

The debit card that the guest handed me declines. I mention it and had the card back to him and ask if he has a different method of payment. He gets super defensive and insists he has money. I tell him to call his bank then. He's like ""let me try swiping it""

I know the issue isn't the swipe so I have no problem letting him swipe the card since it will still decline. We still use the old magtek readers so I place mine on the desk and he pulls a card identical to the one he had handed me, swipes it, and the charge goes through no problem.

HUGE red flag since he didn't contact his bank at all. I ask to see the card again and he hands me one that doesn't have his name on it, but also has a different expiration than the card he just swiped. This card is identical to the first card- it's a red debit card issued by the same bank. I tell him that's not the card he just used and that I need to see the card he used. He gets super defensive again and hands me a third card- that looks identical to the first two, but has a different name. This is the card he swiped, and I ask if that person is present with their ID. He says they're in the car and have a picture of their ID but no the physical one present. 

I tell him I can't check him in since the person has to be here with their physical ID and he leaves. He comes back to ask about the charge on the card that isn't him (since it was authorized- oops!). I print him a 0 balance folio that shows no charges and he leaves. 

But never before have a I seen a 'card switch' like this.",169,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0C57BE0>
412,Xcells Stories Vol. 8 (The return),"Hello fellow Front Desk people.

It is I, Xcell! (Bonus points if you get the reference)

Last time I posted here it was 3 years ago

I think its time I return back to posting. I got so many stories to tell and I believe you will be interested to read.

*Wrong hotel*

As per usual people dont read. Nothing much we can do there but we try to accomodate them and provide a solution. Cue 23:30 (11:30PM), phone rings.

X: Hello this is (Redacted), my name is Xcell how can I help you?

G:Evening. We just booked the hotel via your website and cant find the hotel. According to the address you should be in the city at (Street).

X: That is correct, where are you currently? Maybe I can point you in the right direction.

G: Yeah well the GPS says we are at the (Street) but there is no House number 174 only 14.  
X:That is very odd. Have you tried other apps or GPS?  
G:Yes but it tells me my destination is about 500 more kilometers away.

X:Can you give me your name so I can check the system for the booking?

G:Sure. Its XXXXX.

X:Okay, the booking is not for our city but rather for a city with familiar name. I guess you are at XXXX. Their address is (Address).

G: Oh let me punch that in.

G:Yes, now it shows we are 4 minutes away. I am terribly sorry for the mixup.

X: No worries I hope the room is waiting for you in (City name).

G:Thank you soooooo much. We are going to pass by your city tomorrow and we would like to buy you coffee.

X:No need Sir. Have a good night and safe travel.

Cue next day. I come in the evening and there is a envelope from the other hotel. My FOM tells me some couple with kids left it around noon. Said you were nice and helpful when they were tired and and wits end.

I tell her what happened and she understood. In the envelope was a thank you card and 5 Euro note. Nevertheless it brought a smile to my face, what fascinates me the most they remembered the address from my hotel and actually on their way home came by to show their appreciation.

*The party never stops*

Cue saturday. Current hotel where I work is ""surrounded"" by 4 ""clubs"". Not even Corona stops the guests but that was before this ""new variant"" hit.

We are decently booked and I know for a fact there is a different kind of concert going on nearby where the guests are more mature and require good nights sleep.

In the nightmare of trying to arrange party guests on lower floors and keeping them off bar rolls in a group of about 6 girls/women.  
Check in goes realtively smooth, everyone is vaccinated, papers are in order. Deposit taken with minor grudges. They were a bit tipsy but nothing alarming I cant deal with.

After getting ready they go out to the city/clubs, same for the rest of the guests there to party. About 1 AM guests from the concert are rolling in to their rooms. No issues all good. Sold some water and handed out shaving/tooth care kits.

4 AM

Party guests are comming back. I closed the bar beforehand in preparation.

Guess what they wanna continue partying and drinking in the lobby. No way, Jose. Told them to go their rooms and respect the house rules. In translation, be fucken quiet and dont disturb others.

Not happy, somewhat angry but they resigned to the fate and went upstairs. 30 minutes later calls from different rooms call me to ask if they can have something from the bar delivered. Big fat nope.

30 after that some of the guests took taxis to the nearby gas station to buy ""supplies"".

After they are returning one by one I warn them that if I hear a peep from anyone. They will be sleeping outside in the cold.

""OK DUDE, DONT WORRY""

X: ""One and final warning!""

15 minutes later delivery guy is delivering some food? What the flying fuck? 1st floor. Fuck, but I call the room and they pick it up. On the phone I heard music in background but no one called to complain. Maybe this low floor high floor I did is working.

End of shift. Early shift takes in all the info from me.

Next day I found out the guests never stopped drinking and they actually left the room in good condition. Even fucken sorted out the trash and bottles. From what early shift gathers they continued drinking ate something then slept from 10 till 12. Checked out and went on their merry way.

A wonder, no one complained. No broken shit. No vomit or other bodily fluids where they dont belong.

*Thats expensive! Vol.2*

In one of my previous stories we had a guy who complained about the price. This one is similar but with a plot twist.

So its night shift, around 1 AM. No arrivals. Price is decent at 84€ but I only have 1 of those rooms.  
Other category is 94€ with also very few rooms available.

In comes a guy in his forties, well groomed and dressed.

G:Hello. I dont have reserved with you tonight but I need a room. How much your rate.

X:Hello Sir. I have only one available room for 84€ and I have some other rooms available for 94€.

G:Thats a bit pricey for a hotel of your chain/standard.

X: We are fairly booked and the prices changed twice today. Nothing much I can do about the price unless you are Member of the Loyalty programme.

G:No unfortunately not. On `fooking.com` the price is 79€ should I book it there?

X: You can do whatever you want Sir. I wont pressure you. Your choice.

G:Gimme few seconds and I will be back with you.

Off he goes in the chair in the lobby fiddling with the phone. Probably trying to reserve the room.

Call comes in. One of our sister properties needs a room because they are -1 on inventory and the guest is in the taxi underway to our property and will arrive in 5 minutes. No issues, last room for 84 € out. 94€ rooms left.

The guest managed to book something, atleast he said he did and wanders over to me.

G: Right so I booked a room.

X: You will have to wait 5-10 minutes untill the system picks up your reservation. As soon as I have it I will let you know.

G:Okay. I guess I will wait.

The guest from other property arrives. Quick and easy check in, few formalities. No card or payment needed, our sister property will handle that with our management in the morning. The usual.

I check the system to see if that guys reservation came in. It did for tomorrow/today as I still havent pushed End of Day in Opera.

G:Is it in.

X:Yes but you booked for tomorrow/ today. \[Insert Explanation on how shit works\]

G: Okay but can I check in after you change the date in the system?

X: Sure but check in hours are from 3PM, therefore there will be extra cost for early check in.

G:Sure, fine, whatever.

X: I need about half an hour then I will let you know we can proceed.

EoD done, I call the guest. We start the check in I explain everything including the extra cost.

X:So your room rate is 79€ plus the Early check in fee which is 10€ per hour before the check in time. Currently its 2:30 so we round that to 3AM which would be 12 hours before check in time so 120€ on top of the 79€. In total 199€, if you are paying in cash there will also be a deposit needed in addition to payment, thats 50€.

G:THATS EXPENSIVE! I WONT PAY THAT MUCH!

X:Sir calm down. I understand but you also have been explained everything.

G: I WILL NOT PAY THAT MUCH I WILL BOOK ANOTHER HOTEL SOMEWHERE ELSE.

X: Okay Sir. You can cancel the reservation via fooking but since you are cancelling it on the arrival day cancellation fee will be charged.  
G:I REFUSE. I WILL PAY NOTHING!

X: Well then. The reservation will run as a ""No Show"" and your card will be still charged. In case it gets declined fooking will request you to pay your cancellation and if you dont...

G: I WONT PAY SHIT. I AM LEAVING. YOU CAN SHOVE YOUR ROOM AND HOTEL UP YOUR ASS.

X: Fine Sir have a good night.

Guest leaves furiously. Cancellation comes in 10 minutes later, and by wonder and bit of luck the room was prepaid. VCC went trough. I am happy and fooking is happy.

20 minutes later: Angry call from the guy. Told him in a polite way to go fuck himself and take it up with fooking.  
20 more minutes: Fooking calling. They want to request free cancellation for the guest. Uh, told them in a polite way to go fuck themselves. VCC is already charged and reservation is processed.

Fooking agent understands and as per usual wanted my name and position. Told him due to GDPR he can go fuck a porcupine in the back.

Frustrated he hang up.

Fast forward few days. I am on my day off. Enjoying some well deserved RnR cooking food and watching funny shit on YouTube.

Phone ringing. FOM.

Shit. BOHICA (Bend over here it comes again)

She wants to know what happened and what got fookings panties twisted.

I explained my whole interaction including the call with agent.

She replied,""Ah okay, no worries you are fine just wanted to check up whats up. I will tell that to GM""

Later I found out fooking got its panties in a bunch cuz of chargeback by the guest and they wanted the money from us for that. After being told what was my interaction with the guest and their agent they decided all is fine and they will fight the chargeback with the bank.

Fuck em.

Thats all for now. I still gotta finish up my shift(yes, I am currently writing this on my shift).

More stories to follow. Keep an eye out here. Until then I bid you farewell dear reader and remember: ""Coffee works both ways on bad days.""",7,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0C57C40>
413,We ARE Front Desk Agents!!,"We are NOT God, NOT officers of the Law, NOT your therapist, NOT I.T technicians who know how to fix the stupid computer in the business center (we will try our best though…) but in this case… we are NOT body guards. 


The other day I had a “guest” (who for whatever reason) decided he was gonna spark up a (very random) political conversation with a young couple in the market place while they warmed up their food. They were honestly just trying to mind their own business… As far as I know they didn’t even know this man. They were being super friendly and polite (but standoffish… like “please stop talking to us”) 

I walked to the back to do busy work and watch my show. I guess Mr. Political said something that really pissed this couple off (I don’t know what was said)… all I heard was “say something like that again and see if you don’t get f**kd up” then they ended up grabbing their food and going back to their room. 

Mr. Political left shortly after but called from his room later on asking for my name saying he’s going to report me to corporate because I “didn’t protect him and he could have been killed and I did nothing about it”. Like sir??? I definitely don’t get paid enough to risk MY life because you like to randomly start random conversation, with random people, about random controversies. I have a family to get home too.

414,Fraudulent Charges,"This woman has stayed here in the past, and she's *always* been an issue every time she's stayed. Not to the point of us refusing service, though. She's made complaints about not being able to pay on a card, wanting to pay in cash at check in, she always has her ""husband"" with her. It had gotten to the point where she would authorize on a card at check in, and pay cash at check out, which is totally fine and is actually our policy. 

She hadn't stayed in a while, and suddenly was back, but this time she was paying for her daughter to stay here. Since she'd last been here, we'd gotten stricter on not taking cash at check in, and taking everything (room, tax, and incidentals) on a card. She gave me a card, never said she'd wanted to pay in cash until I swiped for the total and her card *declined*. When I told her it declined, she then had issue with the rate that she'd booked. She told me she'd seen it cheaper online and had wanted to discuss changing it since her daughter would be in for a long length of time. I told her online rates were promotional rates, and I could only give her discounts she qualified for, which were none. If she wanted the cheaper rate, she could book it online. 

She then said she'd also wanted to pay in cash for the entire stay. She said she only had a set amount on her card for incidentals, but that I could hold incidentals on her card, and she pay cash for the room.

So, I of course, I told her that she couldn't pay in cash at check in, that we had to be able to authorize everything on one card. She, of course, gave me a hard time about it. I reiterated that it was policy, and that management has asked us to take everything on a card. She said that *I* was just giving her a hard time, that she's never had a problem being able to pay in cash before. I told her I *remembered* her, and every time she's stayed in the past, she's authorized on a card and paid at check out. She feigned ignorance like she had no idea who I was and I was clearly lying to her. She stepped back and said she wanted to speak to a manager. 

Usually: I have no issue going into my GMs office and grabbing her for situations like this. But the GM was out on the floor helping maintenance with several issues we were experiencing that morning, so I told her she'd have to wait because management wasn't in their office at the moment. She *demanded* I get someone, because I was *going* to check her in the way she wanted. Word for word what she told me, and by this time she was rolling her neck and talking *at* me in a raised tone of voice. 

""You know ma'am, if you're going to be nasty to me, I really don't even have to check you in at all. I can refuse you service."" She then gets even  more agitated, and says that I'm being racist towards her, and now she knows why I've been giving her such a hard time about check in procedures. By that time, management was walking into the back office, so I told her I would be right back, and I'd be out with the GM in a second. 

Because I'm already fuming on the inside, I tell GM the situation, and she tells me to sit down in the back, that she would handle it. I can *hear* the woman from the back, and by this time her daughter has now come in: wearing nothing but pajamas with her small child with her. Amidst her ""Explanation"" of what happened and how I was extremely rude and prejudiced towards her, I hear her daughter say, ""She's lucky I wasn't in here."" The GM goes, ""Excuse me?"" and proceeds to tell her that respect is a two-way street, and that kind of behavior isn't tolerated here. If they have a problem, they can go stay somewhere else, there are plenty of other hotels in the area they can stay at. 

GM decides after the mother apologizes and compliments GMs wedding ring, etc. etc. that she would book them in, take a cc swipe as procedure dictates, but gave them a discounted rate as a courtesy for the inconvenience. What inconvenience, I couldn't tell. She stays, for a *long* period of time, leaves, and then we get a chargeback for all of those nights. Apparently the account belonged to someone else, and somehow she'd had the strip changed on her card or something. We lost all that money, and we put her on our Do Not Rent list for fraud. 

Just last Friday, a woman calls down to the desk to make a complaint about her toilet in her room not working. Said she wanted compensation, I ask her what room number and last name, and *sure enough* it's the same lady. Somehow (obviously front desk overlooked it) she got in and was now making a complaint to get her money back. 

""Actually, you're on our do not rent list, so you're not even supposed to be here."" I told her plainly. She acted like she was so shocked, wanted to talk to management on why she was on the DNR. I told her it was due to her card being used fraudulently for her stay in the past. She said that was a huge mistake, and she wanted to talk to the GM. I told her no, and that she'd have to check out. If she wanted to speak to management, she'd have to wait until Monday. 

She comes down some time later to leave, and has the nerve to strut very exaggeratedly past the desk when she sees me. I mean like swinging her hips like she has nothing to feel ashamed about. I'm sorry, was that supposed to make me feel salty? LMFAO",28,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0C57D00>
415,"Good luck to you, sir, on finding an open pharmacy at 3 am...","This is just gonna be a short little tale. Nothing absurd like my old property. Just an old dude being grumpy.

So, I clock in and my agm gives me the heads up about this particular room. She explained to me that it is an elderly couple who had checked in. The wife is a little hard to understand from most likely being disabled, but as sweet as a peach nonetheless. No problems with her.

It's her husband who's a little difficult. Not extremely difficult but definitely makes you roll your eyes in the back office when you get done talking to him. Check in goes smooth but it's when he tries to get the door open. Comes back down saying ""This fucking door won't open!"" 

My agm asks him what is going on. Turns out, somehow, he thought you pushed the card through a slot like what a lot of older properties have. Our doors are the ones where you just hold the card on the round black circle for it to open. How he thinks it's one of the old kind of locks is beyond me. So she explains it to him on how to do it and how he can't just wave it quickly either while making him a new set of keys just in case.

He comes back down with the same issue and saying ""Someone has to fucking come up and help me!"" My agm goes up with him and using his key set, was able to open the door. We don't know what he was doing but I'm thinking he sat up there without trying anything. 

He calls down after a while getting mad because he couldn't figure out how to enter a wake up call on the room phone. *sighs* My agm tried to explain to him that he doesn't but he kept getting more agitated and wanted to know. And then was pretty much like I have already taken care of it. 

She fills me in on all of this when I clocked in. She wasn't sure if I was gonna deal with him or not during my shift as usually guests like him are normally in bed when I roll in. 

Welp, guess who came wandering in the lobby at 3 am. It started off nicely. Just a simple question of where the nearest open pharmacy is. Told him I'd look it up for him and when I did there was no open pharmacy. None of them open until 9 am. We don't have a 24 hr pharmacy. He didn't like my answer. Tried to argue with me for a minute but I told him ""Sorry, I don't know what to tell you. All the pharmacies that are showing up in the area are closed until 9 am"" He stormed off into the night looking for an open pharmacy. 

Well, good luck to you then sir. May your stubbornness drag you out until 9 am to find an open pharmacy.",48,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0C57D60>
416,A case of mistaken identity,"""I don't like to complain, but there appears to be some feces under the sink in my bathroom."" 

Great. My favorite type of phone call, especially when we have a small line of guests forming in the lobby and my coworker is on a call with a guy who wants to try to negotiate our rates on what's looking like it'll be a sold-out night. I apologize profusely and do a room move for the guest. I get the guest his new keys, wait a few minutes, and confirm he's settled into his new room. I proceed to go back to the old room and check on the shit-uation. The piece of something under the sink *could* be feces but it looks more like a rock. I run down to the linen closet on the floor, throw on some gloves, grab a small trash bag, and go back to the room. Upon picking it up, I realize it's not a rock and it's not feces; It's a rotten grape. As I fill my coworker in as to why I've been running around like I'm training for a marathon, the guest comes down so I explain my findings to him. We all had a good laugh about it and he thanked us for taking care of the situation so quickly.",22,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0C57DC0>
417,5 times and counting,"Obligatory mobile formatting apology.

This probably isn’t as thrilling as most of the tales here, but I’m thoroughly annoyed and need to have a bit of a rant, so;

We have a repeat guest, let’s call him Mr. Conrad (first name I came up with). He stays with us frequently and always requests mobile keys.

A few months ago we started getting scammers that would hack into the Generic Hotel App Accounts and create reservations and request mobile keys, forcing some innocent person to front the bill. We decided to stop giving mobile check ins for a while to try and stop this. (It didn’t work, and I have what I suspect is another one sitting on my dashboard right now, but that’s not relevant to this story.)

Mr. Conrad calls on one of the days we aren’t doing mobile keys, asking why he never received one. I explain to him that for the safety of all our guests, we have chosen not to do mobile checkins. He’s mad, rants a bit about how he wasn’t told, I tried to explain that it was a personal choice and we could not turn off the requests, only choose not to send them out. He was somewhat receptive but was still mad. He comes in to get a physical key and rants some more. Honestly, it’s not the first time someone has been mad at me for something stupid, so I don’t even remember much of the first incident.

Second time he calls, he’s again wondering why he hasn’t received a mobile key. At this point we’ve resumed our mobile checkins. I look at his reservation and see he doesn’t have a form of payment on file. I explain this to him and off he goes about how “he called earlier and confirmed the card on file, you must have done something to mess it up. Every time I stay here you give me problems. No one else messes up my reservations but you. I’m going to have to talk to your manager and have them find out why you’re always screwing up.”

(I look deeper into his reservation and saw that there was never a card on file. One of my coworkers made a mistake. But, of course, I answered the phone, it’s my fault.)

He eventually just creates a new reservation after 5 minutes of trying to argue with me as I tried to explain, got a mobile checkin, and went on his way.

Which brings us to today… he calls again, asking why he didn’t receive a mobile key. I look at my dashboard and don’t see his name. I inform him his request hasn’t shown up. He once again throws a fit about how I always screw up his reservation. I got tired of it, decided I wasn’t going to deal with that, and hung up before asking my FDM if I could just not let him stay. She has to run that question by our GM, so… we’ll see how that goes. For now I’ve been told just to hand him my FDM’s info and walk away.

Hope your guys’ day are going well!

EDIT: Oh wow, an update this quickly! Turns out the reason his mobile key request didn’t show up was due to a computer error. It got resolved and I sent him a key, and he immediately called to tell me again how much of a screwup I am. I told him I was done having this conversation and he told me my attitude is why I don’t deserve a job and he will be speaking to my general manager to have me “taken care of.” I have personally spoken to my general manager about this guy before and his exact words were “f**k that guy.” So, I doubt that conversation will go his way.",13,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0C57E20>
418,Just a Rant,"Today is day 6 out of 6 and it has been a long, long week. I am two hours away from going home and enjoying my weekend, and the guests are testing me today! 

I will Never understand why guests try and argue that the rate on 'the website' is different than the one I'm telling you. 2% of the time, you are looking at a member rate on our website. 98% of the time, you googled our hotel and are looking at god knows what. 

Honestly, it has gotten to the point where I want to hang up. ""I saw on the website-"" I don't care! I don't give a rats ass what you saw on the google, Helen. I am quoting you the rates that I have in front of me. If you want that rate, book on the website! Why are you on the website if you're going to call in to book?

Book it there then, and stop whining in my ear about how expensive it is to vacation! If you are going to argue with me about a difference of two dollars, then maybe you shouldn't be spending your money on a vacation, Helen.

419,Functioning Druggies - or no?,"This week we've had 2 incidents I wonder about.    Masks do make it harder to see a drug addict these days which is super frustrating :(

We will get a girl check in with ID and cc.   Next morning breakfast attendant says there is a guy acting weird, tweeking abit getting breakfast.  I look on the camera and yes, he's kinda swaying, bouncing, but getting food.   He doesn't take too much, but it is obviously drugs.   aaaaand then there are two guys.   Hoods up, jogging pants but bright new shoes.  ""lookin fly"" but tweeking.   They are polite at check out but 100% druggies, especially when you see the original girl without a mask it's obvious.  Room is always clean, but stinks like cologne which is most likely covering up the meth pipe smell.  Plus the lies at check out...one guy called the girl his wife, the other guy 1 minute later said that's his girlfriend.  Then they proceed to act super high outside, like they just did the biggest rail of coke and can't stop moving or twitching.

Anyone else dealing with this.   Since it's happening again here in just a short amount of time, I'm worried they will get comfortable and inviting more druggies in the future.   I'm currently looking for anything to have reason to keep them away (pipes in garbage, anything) but no luck.  ITS JUST SO OBVIOUS but we have no cause to kick out or never allow back.

Another thought, they do usually always check in at 1am or onward, should I just train staff to say sorry we're full (we have tons of excuses up our sleeve) tonight.

420,"Before making a reservation, please ask what is available for parking oversized vehicles.","I currently work in a small hotel, 53 rooms. Our parking situation is barely enough spaces for everyone who stay here as long as they have a regular sized car. The parking lot is a funky Y shape, the bottom is a deadend and the top ends are our entrances/exits.

We are sold out tonight,  I started with one room left to sell. We have 4 drivers from a grocery store with their crew cabs. I have a ton of workers staying  with work trucks and large Ford trucks.  My parking lot is packed, I'm parking the crew cabs along my fire lane by my pool.  None of the commercial vehicles can park on the street due to a local ordinance that will get them ticketed.

I get a call asking if we are pet friendly,  I say we are and that we charge $20 per night. They ask if we have a room, I tell them I have one room left and quote them a price. They ask a lot of questions about having the pet. No other questions were asked during our conversation. I mention again that this is our last room.  They reserve the room, I give them an hour and a half to show up since they didn't give me a card since they were driving. 

They show up before the given time. I see they have a large truck towing trailer with a car on it.  The guest asks where they could park, I told her due to being sold out and our parking situation they would have to park on the street.  That I have nowhere for her to park her large truck with the trailer.  

She ends up throwing an absolute fit. ""Why are the commercial vehicles parked in the lot, that is bullshit,  they need to park on the street."" I tell her if they do they will get a ticket.  Meanwhile the driver is driving on the street and around our parking lot looking for a spot, which there isn't any for the vehicle and trailer. Meanwhile one of the crew cabs shows up and I show him where to park. 

When I walk over to the guest and her truck, she is telling the driver how it is bullshit that we have the commercial vehicles in our lot, that we should just ask them to leave. I mention again about the tickets they will get. I tell him the only spot available is between the two entrances facing the same way as traffic. He says he doesn't want to park on the street. I do mention a few hotels with bigger lots, they ask me the pet policy at those hotels which I don't know.

They end up leaving all pissed off, the lady is still yelling at me about the parking lot. I ended  selling that room 10 minutes later.

If you have a large vehicle with a trailer, for the love of everything,  ask if the hotel has room in the parking lot for the vehicle and trailer. They knew I was selling them the last room, what made them think I had parking at 1230 am for a vehicle that probably would have taken 8 to 10 spots.",29,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0C57F40>
421,"So we are supposed to take checks now and can confirm that if we dont, I will be hearing from the Mayors office and a Lawyer.","So typical Saturday night for me, its busy, we have people showing up every few minutes trying to get rooms for a few hours or the night depending on how drunk/horny they are. Now rolls in Mrs. Karen (because I cant help but call her that after what I just heard).

Karen walks in, asks me how much it is for the night, I let her know the rate and she looks shocked, saying that a motel can charge such a rate. I tell her those are our rates and they have been for the last 8 years (funny enough as far as I am aware we are charging the standard rate that everyone charges if not lower for the type of rooms we have and the area we are located in).

So shes like fine, I ask her for her ID, I do the usual stuff of getting her information in, ask her how many people will be in the room, she is like ""Its ONLY ME for now"", and I stare at her and ask again how many people do you intend to have in this room? She gasps as if I am asking her to lift 1000 lbs, and finally says that her boyfriend will be showing up later that night. Whilst in my brain I am thinking to myself what kind of guy would date someone who has an attitude like this? 

Finally I ask her ""Will you be paying cash or card Ma'am"", and she looks at me confused and is like I am not paying either of those, I will be giving you a check. I look at her and she can tell that I am confused, and I tell her ""Ma'am we do not take checks as a payment method, we even have that written on the board to your left that states our hotels policies"". She is turning bright red with anger already and is reading the board of rules out loud while being mad, and she tells me that its illegal for me to ask her to pay another way, and that whenever she goes and stays at any hotel they always accept her checks as payment, as a matter of fact she is close friends with the mayor of our city and knows a lot of lawyers, and if I do not take her checks as payment she will be calling them right now to get this hotel shut down and is going to sue me as well. 

She goes on and on about the Law, and why I have to take her checks, and cause I am brown skined and she is white, she says that it is racist that I do not want to accept her check as payment. At this point I was already way past my tolerance level with her, but the minute she brought race into it, I knew that I had to get her of my property. I tell her that ""You can call the mayor and all these lawyers you know, and while you do that I am calling 911 and they can take you of my property, you have read the policy there, I have repeated my policy to you, I am done arguing with you, and do not wish for you to be on my property any longer, so either you can leave yourself or let the police come and handle that for you"". 

I've never seen someone run as fast her once I told her I was calling 911, she must have some kind of outstanding warrant or something cause damn! She sped off so fast! It actually made me laugh, this was the first time a situation like this deescalated so quickly. But yeah that was the start of my Saturday shift, how is everyone else's night going?",113,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0C57FA0>
422,People who work at ‘bad’ hotels - how do you do it? (Includes a rant about my bad hotel),"I work at a four star boutique hotel as a front desk supervisor. We’ve been open for about six months. We’ve gotten multiple reviews stating that we shouldn’t be a four star hotel. We do have some big issues to resolve. There are multiple channels that do not work on our TVs - for example people can’t watch ESPN or PBS. We had a sewage pipe burst months ago and it still hasn’t been fixed so the lobby smells like sewage. We have a ozone machine, candles burning, and air freshener and people still comment on how disgusting it smells. We also don’t have heat in the lobby :) Somehow we still get good reviews, but we get plenty of complaints too. It’s frustrating to always have to explain and apologize for things that aren’t really okay.

How do y’all handle things like this?",23,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0C5A040>
423,GM emailed me about my poor service. And CCed *everyone*,"So there is a new stadium near by with a new sports team. As such, our weekends are sold out in months where it has never been common. 

We have three rather small garages for paid, non-guaranteed, parking on our property. The 3rd is rather out of the way, and had been shut a long while for construction during the pandemic. Now it is cleared, but the garage door wont open with guest keys (or lesser master keys the fd and maintenance have).

We knew we were going to sell out of parking last night. I mentioned leaving the garage door open as an option, and the FDM and the FD supervisor (both who stayed late to help with the immense number of checkins) discussed it, and said no, due to the heavy homeless in our area, and a recent breakin of several cars a couple weeks back. 

So I spent most my night letting guests down, letting them know we didn't have any more parking, and directing them to local streets and lots that could be paid for space. One guest, who had been here a couple days, and didn't realize the lot would be filled by the time he came back from a day trip, went apoplectic on me, shouting, demeaning my service skills, demanding managers and 100% for the night. I gave him his 100%, but shut down the rest of his insults, put it in the notes, and went on with my night. 

I come in today to an email from my boss, wondering why all the complaints when we have an empty garage. Asked why didn't I let anyone in. How come I didn't leave it open, and if the reason was fear of homeless, that wasn't a good enough reason for the guest unsatisfaction. He said as a senior agent I should know better, that he expects better going forward, and that he wouldn't repeat himself. 

Worst of all, even though it was an email directed to me only, he CCed everyone I work with. Not just the FDM and supervisor, who I guest could be argued as being responsible for being uptodate on my behavior. But other front desk agents, the sales team, the house keeping manager. Dont think I've ever been this embarrassed at work. And I have a military background, where chewing someone out in public is really poor leadership behavior. 

I dont know. I realize everyone in the industry (every industry) are stressed because of covid and shit . But I put up with a lot of sacrificial decisions to help this place, because when I got here the management was really good. You think that would earn me a little grace; even if this was my fault ( and it, uh, wasn't.) you'd think this would earn me no more than a ""Hey man, whats up? Next time do this instead."" in private. But instead I got this, and now im angry and dispirited, and I have to work all day pretending im the opposite. Least the mask helps.",99,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0C5A0A0>
424,"We all like to swim, but maybe your desire to swim shouldn't define your stay, especially if it -14 out.","First time poster in this sub, never knew it existed and I've been in the industry for close to 2 decades now. Obviously, what I post here will not mention the name of hotel I work for, since I don't want it coming back to my employer, but I work at a 110+ luxury hotel, in a rather affluent area. There is very little that surprises me in this industry, but even the common stuff you hear constantly, sometimes makes me scratch me head and ask ""why are you upset about this""

Case in point, like most hotels in our region right now, the latest COVID restrictions have all indoor fitness centers/gym and indoor pools closed down until COVID numbers decrease. Unfortunately, our sister property in the same city as us that is owned by the same parent company, has a semi-heated outdoor pool. For the last month or so, whatever guests that have been staying at our hotel constantly make the same general statement ""So the person who booked our reservation said we can use the outdoor pool over at the other hotel you own"". Bear in mind, even though both hotels are owned by the same parent company, we are operated with different GM's who enact different policies, often based of Public Health guidance. Guests need to remember and understand these following points:

1. Even if another hotel has an outdoor heated pool, they would often prioritize their own guests above others that are staying at other properties.
2. Getting mad at the front desk agent at a property your staying at when the pool is at another, will not help your case. Its not our pool, its theirs's, so its more or less that other hotel's call.
3. You need to stop saying **""Well I booked this hotel, specifically for the pool""**. Most hotel pools are pretty standard size, unless your talking about infinity pools. We all know you didn't book this specific hotel just for the pool, so try and be honest at least.
4. Despite it being a semi-heated pool, going for a swim in -14 weather has to be detrimental to your health. **Obviously, that's my personal opinion**, but I think it can't be good for you, especially during a pandemic when a new variant can creep out.

Thankfully, there is talk of the restrictions lifting in a week or two, but watch when our pool and fitness center are opened back up, only a handful of people want to use it.

Obviously I'm venting a bit, and in truth the hotel I currently work for is heads and shoulders better then the hotel I was at 2 years ago. My last hotel job, the company that owned us cut hours left, right and center, cut the health benefits package for all full timers in half without notification, and the managers they hired were just brought in to pinch every penny (most hotels do, but the ones I used to work for were the worst). This new hotel company I work for is still for maximizing profits, but at least the managers fought to keep the hotel going during COVID, makes sure you got the support and backup needed and full timers like me got to keep my hours and not get laid off.

I will be back now and then to post few horror stories and victories to all my brothers and sisters in the industry.

425,A ghostly encounter," Fun story from when I worked a an extended stay property, if you believe in ghosts:

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

It's circa 2018, and I am the front office supervisor at a 99 room hotel near the mountains in Colorado (just on the southern basin of the foothills, in Littleton).

The property had been there for over 60 years, and have been through a few renovations to keep up the the suburbia that sprouted up around it. I had been there for a few weeks, and nothing seemed amiss. Just new job jitters.

As time goes on, I started working shifts alone. No worries, that was my job. I am not one to get unsettled easily, so I wasn't perturbed by the idea of being alone.

The night ticks on as normal, a few check ins, and me enjoying a podcast or two in-between guest interactions.

To lay out the lobby: on the west side of the room, it had the desk. I was standing at the computer that gave me the most central view of the lobby entrance, as well as being clearly located in the room. On the east side, there was a wall that jutted out (that turned the lobby into a big L shape) from the hallway that lead to the breakfast area. There were computers, and pamphlets on this wall.

During my shift, randomly, I would see a light shadow move across the wall, but not cast by anything. It would catch my eye every time, but it wasn't concerning enough for me to investigate. I knew there were no lights set in the hallway, and the breakfast room was completely dark. I have no idea what it was.

It started to raise the hairs on the back of my neck.

My shift passes slowly, and this shadow keeps popping up at random intervals. I shrug it off as I am relieved, and get into my car to head home.

As I am driving home, I just kept looking into my rearview mirror. I was looking into my back seat, and getting more and more anxious. I felt like I was psyching myself out for no reason.

Finally I get home, put my stuff down, and tell my husband about how weird I was feeling, and this shadow.

All of a sudden, we hear violent, loud scratching on our front door. We both freeze, and stare at our door. The scratching lasts for a couple minutes, and stops as my husband goes to open the door. Our cat has raised hair on his back, and a fluffy tail staring at the door.

I yell out: ""Don't you open that fucking door""

My husband doesn't listen, and flings it open. Nothing.

Absolutely nothing. No sign of a dog running by, no people walking around, absolutely nothing.

No person or animal could have run, and hidden in the time my husband got up to open the door. We were stunned.

When I went back to work the next day, I saw the shadows again.

Building up my remaining nerves, I walked into the hallway, stared into the darkness of the breakfast area, and said:

""I get this is your hotel. and that's fine. we can be here together, but don't EVER follow me home again"".

Small activity continued through my employment, even noted by guests, but nothing followed me home again. Thank god.",8,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0C5A160>
426,"I'm all for sympathy, but your own mom doesn't want you, dude. Yikes!","On to the second guest I wanted to tell you all about. So, this gentleman is obviously on hard times and we're in the northeast during winter. His cousin was kind enough to put him up with us and he stayed for about 2 weeks before my manager kicked him out and No Rented him.

He had this terrible habit of coming down to our little coffee bar, drinking one or two dozen straight creamers and just leaving them around the lobby. The stand is beside one trash can and has a countertop trash can on top of it. Frequently, he would come over with odd questions or to chit chat. Not always bad, sometimes its just a little annoying, but this guy was obsessive. His hair looked like a birds nest and I desperately wanted to hold him and down brush it or shave it off... he's a white guy and it was getting gross and clearly matting. We had to turn off any of his long distance at all because we received a call from someone who explained he had a protective order against him (cool) and was not to be contacted by him. One night, he was worried about getting money to extend his stay the next day and asked me to make a few phone calls because of his long distance being blocked. Kept saying he wished he could call/stay with his mom, several times. I was nice and made 3, no answer, and he was going back and forth about who to call next and I told him he could have one more but then I was done and that I was being way too nice with that because this wasn't something we were suppose to do.

The guy obviously needs psychiatric help, he was making so many local calls in his room, he would routinely accidentally call the front desk and either immediately hang up or say absolutely nothing and even accidentally called 911 once. The final straw was yesterday, his last day, apparently, he decided to run up and down the hall on his floor and made the housekeeper extremely uncomfortable. Like, literally running back and forth.

My supervisor also learned our maintenance guy had brought in a few things for him for winter, some second hand, some new. Gloves, a hat, off brand Carhart fleece, a pair of snow boots.... and he made a comment to him that ""I wish you would've kept those things"" so, he either sold them, traded them, or lost them.... sadly, likely drugs, judging by his behavior.

Towards the end of his stay, the fact that the guy had called and said he had a protective order and the fact the guy had mentioned he couldn't stay with his mother, prompted our night auditor to do a little search on him.

Malicious stalking of his own mother. That's why he couldn't stay with her. She had a protective order against him.

&#x200B;

UPDATE:

His friend/cousin just called. The poor guy has schizophrenia and won't stay in a facility or get treatment in general. He even lied to a clinic and said he had a ride and took a greyhound two hours back to where we are. The friend/cousin was obviously upset, the dudes been missing since we kicked him out and because he can't keep a hold of a debit card, the friend has been transferring his friends money to his account to pay for things for him and the bank thinks he was stealing.

427,Why are you staying here if you hate the place so much??,"I am about to make two posts about two separate guests to simplify things. So, we have a frequent guest that is currently an extended stay until the end of February and we are not an extended stay hotel. We're pretty small, but this happens sometimes because we host businesses and they'll put up their employees here for anywhere from one night to two months, depending. 

He works at a local business and is moving from a neighboring state, so he's staying while he looks at houses and closes on one. This isn't the first time he's stayed with us and he's a guest we dread because he's never happy; there's always a problem. 

This guest was mad I asked for ID, because I recognize him, I explained that it can help look up his Shiny account and he went on with how no one else asks for his ID or his Shiny number and I told him, straight up, I'm not sure how other people are pulling up his account unless they pull up a previous reservation. I also told him I could try his phone number. He was obviously irritated and just continued waiting for his app to load. 

There's only 2 rooms he wants to stay in, so far, this stay, he's complained about the ID, droplets from cleaners housekeeping used (and he tried to say my supervisor was insinuating they didn't really clean, which she obviously wasn't), the fact that there was still a hold on his credit card after he paid cash in full for the entire stay, the information on the receipt he asked for for his first two nights (my supervisor had to manually make him an invoice on letterhead to reflect what he wanted on the receipt), and, he had to move today because we have a large group coming in and they need the room type he was staying in, so, within a few hours, he calls down and is complaining about the smell of the bathroom and insisting I come up and smell it and requests to go back to the room he had before (which is one of only 2 rooms he seems to want to stay in). So, I change his room back, with permission from management and go check out the smell. This dude was so ""upset"" by the smell that he had closed the bathroom door. I will admit, since the door had been closed to maintain the smell, it did seem a bit strong and I felt like I was getting a headache, however, I thought it smelled like a cleaner or air freshener; something artificial from an aerosol can, he insisted he thought it was the pipes and pointed to some overlooked and dirty grout between the bathtub and toilet as well as his experience in maintenance. Upon calling my supervisor back to update her, I informed her what I thought the smell was and she said she thought that might be something like that because she'd seen a few spots that might have been rust and asked housekeeping to use our rust remover on it.

428,Your Parking Lot Is Empty - This Must Be a BAD PLACE!,"Once again I am baffled by the general public in one sentence or less! I just checked in a couple - mind you, they were checking in QUITE early, as our check in is at 4PM, and it was about 1PM at the time of the story. 

ME: Welcome! I'll just get your ID and Credit Card- 

Lady: Is there even anyone staying here??? The parking lot is totally empty..

Now, mind you, where I work, it is very, very seasonal. We go from sold out every single night in the summer to 9 stayovers if we're lucky. So, this lady is checking in in the middle of the day, way before check in time, in the middle of our slowest season. Obviously, there aren't any cars. Anybody who's staying here is at work, and anybody who's arriving hasn't gotten here yet. I don't say any of this though, besides the current guests being at work part. 

Lady: Well, wouldn't you be a little suspicious if the place *you* were going to stay at looked completely deserted?? 

At that point I just smiled and proceeded with check in. What am I supposed to say? What did you expect when you're arriving three hours before check in even starts, and in the middle of a slow season at a hotel undergoing renovations? I just don't understand how an empty parking lot equals a sketchy business. People can really be so strange.",53,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0C5A280>

""No, sorry we're completely booked tomorrow and Monday (What with us being in a major city that's hosting a major sporting event and all...)""
I should mention now that our pass on log says ""NO EXTENSIONS, NO WALK INS"" in the boss' handwriting.
So, he says, ""but here on the website it says you have rooms available, don't you keep (whatever arbitrary number) of rooms aside for [top tier rewards member] members?!"" 
""No sir, we do not.""
Thirty minutes go by, he calls back
""It says here on the site that you do have rooms!""
""Sorry sir, the site needs a chance to update (or whatever excuse I gave)""
""Well, you should talk to corporate to tell them to get a new system!""

I'll get right on that! (I didn't say this out loud)

430,My most annoying refund yet.,"So, we've been pretty slow. It's the off-season. But today was exceptionally busy. We were trying to hit our usual $5k goal for today. And this guy just really annoyed me and I ended up refunding almost $300 over some nonsense.

Guy books a room for two children, two adults. We wait all day for him. Mind you, we aren't busy, so waiting really isn't holding back the room from anyone. Awesome only this one guy to meet our goal for today. 

He checks in, he pays, all is good to go. About 4 minutes in he comes back down, can we cancel our reservation? The room is too small for the 6 of us.

I'm sorry...the what? Legally we can't even HAVE 6 people in a room. So I ended up refunding his entire reservation knowing full well that if we held a night, he'd fight it, and guaranteed he'd get his money back anyway.

Why would you even think to try to reserve a room at a MOTEL for 6 people and think it would be big enough? I'm ... Nope.

432,"""Now she's mad about THAT, too.""","I have a guest who has been lightly pissed since he stepped foot in the hotel. There was a problem with his room at one point so I called to ask him something. He groused that he was in the middle of an important business deal and he'd have to cancel it to come back. I implored him not to come back. We'd work it out without him. He kept saying, no, no, no. He'll come back. I literally never asked him to. Half an hour later he shows up and tears into me. THREE phone calls. We demanded he come back and had the audacity to call him three times. I nod sympathetically knowing that's a straight up lie. 

One night he comes down and says he needs his locks changed. I agree, no problem. He goes on to accuse his girlfriend of robbing him. He says to put it in his profile that she CANNOT enter the room. I assure him that nobody who isn't on the reservation is going to get a key. He mutters that he doesn't really believe we'll stop her. I tell him it's on his profile and in my pass-along. She's not getting in.

Days later he shuffles up to my desk, shoulders hunched, face as sullen as any other day and tells me the room keys suck and he needs a new set. I agree. I get to work making him new ones and he says his girlfriend and he made up. She is allowed in the room. She attempted to get in earlier but we wouldn't let her. He glared at me, ""now she's mad about THAT, too"". Yes sir, how dare we do the thing you explicitly demanded and challenged us to do.

433,Owner from the last hotel I worked at wanted special treatment at my new hotel,"I used to work at a crappy little hotel that paid me bullshit wages. The owner literally showed up two times in the two years that I was there and barely introduced himself. Now I work at a more crappy but higher end and more expensive hotel that pays me better. There are tons of problems at this place but that’s not a part of the story. 

Before I knew who he was, he comes in and explains that he “sent an email” and that nobody got back to him. Apparently he had just sent the email this morning, and it was a long diatribe about how he wasn’t going to need the room at night but only needed it at nine in the morning till the late afternoon basically trying to justify getting some kind of cheaper rate for his odd specific hours. So he explains to me his situation but I unfortunately let him know that he would have to book for two nights because check in time is way after nine in the morning and check out time is it way before 6 PM, Meaning in order to book the room for the specific hours he’s looking for it would count as two days. But even though he owns an entire Fucking Hotel and payed me and others jack shit, he still wanted to finagle the price. Asking about the empty parking lot and saying we clearly needed the business. JFC. Didn’t want to check in the night prior and pay for a late check out, just wanted to have that one day 9 AM check in, no late check out fees. 

Eventually he mentioned that he owns his own hotel and I recognized his last name and asked if it was the one that I worked at. Then all of a sudden he pretended to recognize me even though he maybe saw me once or twice tops in the two years I worked there, and didn’t talk to me for more than 5 seconds. He definitely did not recognize me. Then he tried to pretend like we were friends and use that as a way to get what he wanted. But I stood firm and eventually he decided he didn’t wanna pay for it. 

What an ass. I really should have made the interaction more uncomfortable for him in retrospect but c’est la vie",27,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0C5A460>
434,Crosspost from /r/militarystories - H marks the spot,"Crossposted from /r/militarystories by request

This is a story from my father, Sharp eyed members may be able to deduce the country and that's fine,

So there he was, aircraft commander piloting a large yellow bird crisscrossing a sizeable central province. They were just coming to the end of their allowed flying hours on this search for a downed aircraft when, fortuitously, they passed by a hotel with a helipad. Not one to question his good fortune he lands at said helipad and strides into the hotel.

From this point on HFD - Hotel Front Desk

DP - Dubious Pilot = Father

DP - Hello, I'd like a few rooms for my men, Also I've landed on your helipad is there any aircraft expected overnight or can I keep it parked there

HFD - What?

DP - ( faster this time ) I'd like a few rooms, the governments paying I've landed my helicopter on the helipad, are there any expected aircraft or am I fine to leave it?

HFD – What?

DP – ( Clearly annoyed ) Rooms, men , helipad

HFD - Uhhhh, we don't have a helipad

DP - What's that gray circle outside with a white H in the centre?

HFD - Sir this is a popular hotel chain who's logo is an H, that's our rock garden

DP - Well do you mind if I leave our helicopter in your rock garden

HFD - No one's ever asked me that before.....

435,A little reminder as to why I work hospitality,"I am one of the crazies that actually enjoy my job, GSM at a mid-size hotel (110 rooms, all suites).
I see a lot of horror stories, and have a lot of horror stories, about working a customer-facing job, and thought that a feel-good story would be a nice break.
As stated above, I'm a GSM at a mid-level all suites brand, and I enjoy working with 90% of the people who walk through our doors. I'm a helper by nature, and I love playing the part of the gracious host with the most. This is an account of an interaction last weekend. To set the scene, we had a large dog show group in house, we had some minor complaints, but overall they were impressed with the staff and property.
An older lady, 60+, came down to the desk looking for a good BBQ place as her Polish friend was visiting and she wanted to show off some local cuisine. I gave my typical recommendation of a semi-local place (they don't have Georgia BBQ as it's a NC brand, but it's still good)  but she wanted it delivered.
I informered her she would have to use an app, which she was unfamiliar with, to order the delivery, and that it was ""PayTooMuch.app"". Being an elderly lady, and given that it was a very slow night, I offered to help. 
I walked her through all the steps of downloading, registering for, and using the app, offering suggestions when I though appropriate. To my surprise, they didn't offer fried okra but thankfully collard greens were there. Finally, we put her card info in and placed the order, which she insisted on waiting for on the lobby. 
In due time, the food arrived, and I wished her a good night as she left for her room. Lo and behold, after she checked out, she responded to the survey our brand affiliate sends each guest after they check out, provided they have an email on file. 
She extolled the virtues of our property, marveled at the size of the rooms and trumpeted the service of all the staff. But, at the end, she mentioned little old u/rocketsurgeon15 for helping her order ""delicious food for her out-of-town friend""
This is why I enjoy working a desk. Yes, there are a great many that belittle you, talk down to you, or dismiss you. But getting to make someone's stay in a strange city that much better seems to make it worth it. It reminds me of why I enjoy this career so much. That I get to make someone's day, a stranger, and help them have a memorable experience that makes their time with us something they will want to tell others about.",10,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0C5A520>
436,Nothing is worse than disrespect.,"I’m sitting in the office thinking about a situation that happened an hour or so ago, and while I feel like I handled the situation correctly, I think this may be a learning experience for new front desk staff. 

The TLDR of this tale is: don’t let customers act disrespectful towards you.

I was in the office doing busywork when I hear the door open, nothing to be bothered by yet; guests go outside to smoke in their cars all the time. The doors also have a mind of their own, especially at night and will open when it rains, snows, or the wind blows something by the sensor. A few minutes pass, I check the cameras and all is well. I hear the doors open again and before I even have a chance to check the cameras to see if anyone is coming inside I hear someone scream. Not a panicked “I’m hurt” kind of scream, but just a garbled monotone sound. 

I make my way to the desk and say “hello”. Nothing in return, just an ID smacked up against the spit shield.  Maybe he didn’t hear me, so I smile a bit brighter and stare past his ID, “Hello”.  No answer, and he won’t even look at me. So I have to assume he’s dead right? He’s not speaking words, or answering me. I grab a piece of paper and write out. “Hello! How can I help you today?” And pass it to him with a pen. 

Now I get a reaction, his face is all scrunched up and he smacks his ID against the screen again. “Check me in.” He says. 

I smiled and shook my head, pointing to the “We reserve the right to deny service” sign on the wall. “I’m sorry sir, but you are being incredibly disrespectful. I have to decline you service tonight.”  I went back into the office and closed the door.  He huffed and puffed for a few minutes before he finally left. 

I will not be disrespected, especially not when I’m somewhere I have to be.",41,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0C5A580>
437,"Sorry I'm Not a Mind-Reader, or, A Bizarre and Half-Cocked Grift","A woman booked with a third party company, the identity of which is not important to the story. They're all the same to me. She called and asked a million questions, despite the fact that I had a guest in front of me and said ""I'll be with you in a second, sir"" loud enough for her to hear in an effort to get her to make it quick. The connection wasn't the best on the call, and I'm severely sleep-deprived, so I didn't catch everything she said, but at one point she asked if ""everything was okay with her reservation."" I took this to mean something along the lines of ""Were you able to find my reservation?"" I answered in the affirmative. She asked what she needed to do. I told her we'd get her information, look at her ID, and collect a credit card for incidentals. The call ended. I took the advanced deposit and braced myself.

I checked her in. She was... a lot. She could not find her ID for anything in her purse. She could find her dog's bone, but no ID. (Okay, as someone with two cats and a dog, that's a little relatable, but still.) She rambled on and on about God knows what and then went out to her car to look for her ID. She was gone for probably twenty minutes.

Anyway, I eventually got her checked in and squared away. It's worth noting that my hotel has a restaurant but it is currently closed; they're hoping to open it within the next few days, but I can't make that happen any faster. We inform our guests of this at checkin. She complained that she'd have gone somewhere cheaper if she'd known that. I assumed she was just bitching and let it go. My relief came. It was her problem now.

Well, when I get home, I have a missed call from Relief. Turns out the guest called the third party, trying to get a refund, claiming I had told her on the phone that the restaurant was open. Relief basically said there was no way in hell I would have said that, and she's right.

This lady claimed that when she asked if everything was okay with the reservation, what she actually meant was ""Are all the amenities open?"" and she assumed I knew that.

How would I know that's what she meant? How would anyone? Why would she think anyone would automatically know what she meant by that? If you want to know about the restaurant, use the word ""restaurant,"" not a word with the same first syllable but a completely different meaning! Jesus wept!",17,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0C5A5E0>

Me: ok, i just need him here to check in. 

Her: my name is dumb cunt, here is my id. Check me in. 

Me: mr. dumb cunt should be present, since it’s only his name or-

Her: my last name is the same, my address is the same, i have the member account number check me in. We can never add my name. 

Me: it’s a safett concern, so we can call him to verify.

Her: you don’t need to do that. 

Me: ma’am your name is not on the reservation-

Her: yes but i am here.

Me: next time you are more than welcome to do online check in if you don’t want to come to the front desk. We ask guests to add names or be present at check in for their own safety

Her: i don’t need any of that. If you see the account, you’ll see how many nights we stay.

440,Proved guest wrong with same evidence they used to prove us wrong,"A little background first. I work at a hotel that has a lounge that is currently closed due to covid. We also have a restaurant in the hotel. And I’m the MOD tonight. 

It’s pretty quiet and I’m about to go sit down to eat so I walk to the restaurant to place an order. I come back and my coworker and security guard tells me this guy just went off on my coworker saying because our lounge is closed we have to give him a free breakfast at the restaurant AND points. They deescalate the situation and tell him they will check with me when I get back. 

I get back they tell me what happened and I text my manager to check that it is not true as well as check our poster that goes over all benefits of all the hotels including what hotel does and does not offer when certain benefits are unavailable. I take note of that and prepare myself when the guest comes back. 

The guest comes back with his laptop ask me if I’m the MOD, I say yes and he says perfect then proceeded to tell me what he told my coworker. He also has a website pulled up as evidence. He reads the first couple sentences to me and when I read the entire thing I see at the end of the same paragraph he showed me it says only included these hotels. I then read it to him and the face he gave me was hilarious I almost laughed right then and there. He says thank you and walked away. 

I told my coworker and manager what happened and they also laughed. 

TLDR: lounge is closed guest says we HAVE to give him breakfast and points. Proved guest wrong with exact same paragraph guest used to prove US wrong.",18,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0C5A700>
441,A Short & Sweet One,"At my hotel, we have a lot of corporate guests. Now, I've been the night auditor at this hotel for a year now, so I see the same faces cycling through from that company every week. They're always stand up guys (and sometimes ladies), and are always polite in making small talk with me. They ask me if I'm working on homework (I am most nights), and what I study (anthropology); it usually doesn't go much further than that, but every so often I get a guy who wants to talk about something in my subject area (archaeology and human evolution being the most popular topics). This conversation took place on such an occasion:

Him: So what do you think of that evolution? Do we all come from monkeys?

Me: Well, it's a bit more complex than that-

442,I SEE YOU STEALING!,"I have a 3-year old kid of my own, so I'm already learning that kids will be kids about most things. That's just how it is. 

We have a family staying at my hotel that is here because something happened to their home, so their insurance is paying for them to stay here until it's fixed. It's a single mom, a teenage daughter who has her own newborn baby, and a little 8 year old girl. The teenage daughter also has a boyfriend just as young as she is who is also staying in their room. 

The little girl likes to steal. I'd already heard through the grapevine from a co-worker of mine that she'd been caught stealing from our market before. My co-worker had gone to the back office for a second, and the little girl waited until the door closed behind her before she got up from the lobby chair, ran over to the market and stuffed her pockets full of candy and then ran and sat back down like nothing had happened. Not knowing that we have cameras all over the hotel that we can see from the back office monitor. My co-worker went back out and told her, ""You do know you have to pay for all of that, right?"" The little girl feigns ignorance and says, ""Oh....I didn't know..."" so she tells her to put them back. That obviously didn't stop her though. 

This morning, *I'm* working the morning shift, and I see this same child walk down the corridor over towards the market area. I didn't *haul ass* like I could have, just to be petty, but I walked out there and figured she'd ultimately decide, ""nevermind"" and walk away. She does. She immediately leaves that area as soon as I open the office door and come out to the front. I asked her as she passed me, ""Did you need anything?"" She looks me dead in the eye, and says no as she wipes her mouth with one of our breakfast napkins like she was just drinking her juice minding her business. 

I go back after she leaves and watch the cameras, and sure enough, she took candy and put it in her pocket quickly before moving away. I immediately get on the phone and call her mother. Normally I would just wait to speak to her mother later, but after looking at their bill in our system, I see notes and whatnot that state the teens from the room (boyfriend and daughter included) have been adding market items to the room when there is no card on file for incidentals. That we've made attempts to get in contact with her so she knows about it, but no one has gotten back to us. 

Obviously their insurance won't want to cover these charges. So not only do we need a card on file for incidentals (don't know who dropped the ball on getting that), but your kid is stealing and your teenage daughter and boyfriend are adding things to your bill. 

She doesn't answer, but calls back a little later: 

Her: Somebody called me from there? I'm thinking it was ya'll or my daughter in the room. 

Me: Is this Miss \_\_\_\_\_\_? 

Her: Yeah 

Me: This is \_\_\_\_\_\_\_, the front office supervisor here at the hotel. I'm calling because your youngest daughter has been taking things from our market area. She's already---

Her: Hold up, hold up, hold up, because I can't hear you, I need to pull over. 

(I'm sure you heard me fine. But okay.) 

Her: Go ahead? 

Me: This is \_\_\_\_\_\_ here at the hotel. Your youngest daughter has been taking things from our market area. She's already been told by another staff member that those items do need to be paid for the last time she took some. But she's still taking things now, she just took something this morning before she left. 

Her: Oh....okay.....how do I go about getting a new comforter? 

Me: I'm sorry? 

Her: A new comforter, for the sofa-bed in the room. How do I get another one? My oldest daughter just had her cycle so the one in the room needs to be changed. 

I literally paused. Not because I was shocked, but because I didn't know whether I wanted to go ahead and give her a full taste of my smartass attitude, or if I wanted to play nice this morning and tread the line of nice/nasty with her instead. 

Me: You would just request a new one from front desk. 

Her: Okay, I just wasn't sure how I'd go about getting another one. 

Me: Right. Yeah, you could just ask for one. 

Her: Alright then, thanks for letting me know, I appreciate it. 

Me: Um, I do need to know what you're doing about the incidentals. There isn't a card on file for you, and your insurance won't be covering any of your incidental charges. 

Her: (mad because I'm obviously giving her a hard time at this point) Well, I *could* just pay for the items, what's the balance? 

Me: Your balance right now is $48.50. Besides paying it off, we do need to have a card on file just to authorize for other incidentals, besides the balance you already have. 

Her: Hold on, why is it so high?! 

Me: You have market items on your room that have been added by your kids, and then you also have lots and lots of Long-Distance phone calls being made from your room. 

Her: My phone number is a long distance phone number, and my daughter's phone doesn't keep a charge, so she needs to be able to call me in the event she needs me for anything. 

Me: I understand. Our phones in the rooms are automatically routed so that they charge for long-distance calls, so there is no way for me to stop the system from charging for that. The only thing I would suggest is if she needs to call you, she can come down here to the desk and make a call to you from our front desk. 

Her: So she would literally have to leave the room just to call me or else it'll charge my account? 

Me: Yes ma'am. 

Her: This is so ridiculous. Alright, well, I'll come by and pay for the balance. Thank you.

443,My favorite guest complaint,"
It is circa 2019, here in Colorado. I was working at an extended stay property as a Front Desk Supervisor.

I was newly appointed to the role, and as such: was ambitious to prove that I could resolve EVERY guest issue (I later unlearned this ridiculous expectation).

We have a family come to check in, a middle aged Husband and Wife, and three kids ranging 7-12. They were there per their insurance, as they managed to burn down their house. We were prepared for their arrival, and offered our condolences, while welcoming them to their new home for the next couple of months.

Nothing seems out of the ordinary, nor do they seem like particularly entitled guests; just a family down on their luck.

Time moves forward, and shifts pass without anyone seeing them. Not particularly unusual, since there were multiple methods to depart the elevator, and the hotel without interacting with the front desk (or, as I like to say, my favorite kind of guests. Stick to themselves, and don't yell at me about how many complimentary waters are required to sustain their existence while staying with us).

On this particular day, a strange letter is delivered in our daily mail. The return address has their last name, and it is addressed for immediate opening by a manager. I shrug, and open it, thinking MOD is good enough.

What follows to the BEST complaint letter I have ever gotten. I even framed it, as it was hilarious.

This family was awoken on their first night by the exclamations of two people in the throws of making love. The head board is pounding, the moans are reverberating, and this family was traumatized.

They said: ""We could not believe that two people were capable of making noises similar to that of a dying yak. We figured this would be a godly, and family friendly hotel. How dare you allow those kinds of activities to happen in the ear shot of children. We will send you a bill for the therapy our poor children will have to endure after this.""

She did, in fact, send and attempt to sue the property over the money for a therapist. The case was dropped, as our legal team had to explain that sexual intercourse does in fact happen at hotels *Frequently.*

What gets me, is that she never complained to us that night. They just packed up, and shipped out.",79,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0C5A820>
444,"Well, That’s One Way to Protest Taxes","Talking with a coworker recently, I remembered this incident from a while back.

Here at the Legal Garden, probably circa 2016(back when the hotel was still respectable), I had a guest checkout and ask for their receipt.

Ok, everything is normal.

I give the guest their receipt, and they become furious at how much the taxes are.  Now, the applicable state, county, and local taxes add up to 12%.  Hardly worthy of the following response, although nothing would be.

It starts with the usual entitled guest wanting me to do something about it.

I tell the guest I can’t, and the guest leaves and heads to the bathroom.  A short while later, the guest exits and heads outside.

I have to use the bathroom, and when I enter, I notice that someone has taken a massive dump in the sink.  Now, it wasn’t there earlier in the night, no one else came down during the night, and the first guest didn’t mention it as they left, so that narrows down the suspects.

Not only did they take a dump in the sink, but they either played with their shit by squeezing/breaking it up to make a bigger mess, or they ate at Taco Hell.

Luckily(well, not for her) our houseman is arriving for their shift, and I warn her about what has happened.  It took quite a while to get the bathroom back in order.

I hope management compensated her in some way for that.",16,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0C5A880>

446,The First DNR,"Hello, your friendly local night auditor here. It's 2:09, audit is running, and I just baked 160 fresh cookies and the lobby smells AMAZING. I've mentioned before that we have no DNR list, despite clearly needing one. This is a story of the first guest I have heard of being explicitly banned.

THE CAST

OL: Old Lady, our guest.

Me

Mumbly Mike: my usual desk partner


The scene begins at the start of my shift. PM shift mentions some lady passed out and had to be taken to the hospital. That sucks, hope she's okay. Moving on. Not even an hour later, a tiny woman comes up and starts asking about freezers with that kind of manic energy that we all know means trouble. She's still got those monitor stickers on her chest. This is OL. I manage to get it through to her that our minifridges don't have freezers, and she goes on her way. 

Shortly after, a call comes from one of the hallway phones. Nothing good ever comes from those phones. It's always either someone in trouble, or someone making trouble. She wants to know if she can make outgoing calls. Yeah, the instructions on making outgoing calls are printed on the room phones. You would see this if you went into the room instead of standing in the hall. At this point, she's mildly irritating, but not really an issue.


Until she comes downstairs. She's barefoot, in her pajamas, carrying something. She wants to use the microwave. Sure, I show her where it is. And she proceeds to pull out an entire fucking frozen pizza. The kind that you definitely make in an oven, not a microwave. I have already decided that I do not want to argue with this woman. I give her some paper plates to attempt damage control. Mike has come to the conclusion that the hospital must have given her the good stuff.

OL picks some things out from the market, including a chocolate lava cake. This will be relevant later. She gives us a room number... and it doesn't match. We ask for her name and... no match. We ask to see her keys, and she gets too distracted before we actually have them. We're starting to worry. Who is this random old woman eating a half-frozen pizza in our lobby? Eventually, we get a full name... turns out, she is in fact a guest, our system just doesn't like it when you're looking for the second half of a hyphenated name. Fine, whatever. One suggestion email to the help desk later, I go back into the office to eat my lunch.

And that's when I see the sign on the housekeeping desk. 
""**UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES IS ANYONE TO ENTER [OL'S ROOM NUMBER]. IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS, ASK [GM]**""

Well, fuck. We just cut her new keys and made sure she knew the correct number. What the hell is the deal with that room? The GM is asleep and nobody left anything explaining this, just a big ass ominous sign. We decide to wake up the AGM, since he's on property. Turns out, the sign was only for housekeeping, to make sure nobody touched OL's meds while she was in the hospital and they weren't sure if she was coming back. So I woke him up for nothing, and I owe him a Red Bull later.

Meanwhile, Mumbly Mike is trying to explain to her how to use the elevator. It's just not getting through. I give up, hop in the elevator, scan a key, and send her on her merry way. I look down at her hands as I pass her the key. OL is covered in chocolate lava cake. Fuck. So I start looking for cleaning supplies to scrub cake off every surface she touched. It's on the tables, the guest computer, the elevator buttons, EVERYTHING. Jesus. While I'm ceaning, Mike gets a phone call. OL's door won't open. He knows damn well she just isn't holding her card to the scanner long enough, but goes up to help her anyways. He gets a look into the room. It's trashed. Fucking joy.

We don't see her again, but according to AM shift, she had to be removed by paramedics and police and her family contacted. If she returns, she is not to be given a room. 

And so, the first DNR of my time here is not given to the repeat offender room-smoker, nor the thieving drunks, but an old woman with likely mental health problems. Sigh.


EDIT: So I made sure to ask the morning crew for the rest of the details, because something had to have happened. And oh boy, it happened. 

Two new folks join our cast: A, a perfectly nice day shift FD, and Mr. Whiskers, the one I woke up earlier. (He's clean-shaven, our GM just talks about him like he's the office cat.)

So Mike left at 6, I left at 7, leaving the desk in the capable hands of A and Mr. Whiskers. 

OL arrives for breakfast around 9:30, already acting erratic. She's dragging a big bag of stuff with her, which she leaves in the breakfast area. She only has one shoe, which is one more than she had last night. 

She decides to purchase the big water bottles in the market. All of them. And all of the desserts. (That explains why there was nothing stocked when I got in last night...) So OL is lining up these water bottles, chatting with A, and stealing all of the pens. Not even being subtle, just taking handfuls of pens and shoving them into her bathrobe/house coat thing.

At some point, Mr. Whiskers is sufficiently alarmed to call for an ambulance, because this lady needs help. The paramedics arrive, chat with her... and leave. They apparently decided she didn't need it that badly. This might have set something off in her, because this is what finally got her truly kicked out.

Despite the best efforts of myself, Mike, and probably also A and Mr. Whiskers, she has no idea how to operate the elevator. So she just starts riding to random floors. Of course, being mid-morning at a hotel, housekeeping is going about their business, propping open doors as they go. Apparently, OL was walking into these rooms and stealing things like towels, pillows, soap, and taking it back to her room. Having attempted to get her actual help already, the front desk gives up and calls the police. Thankfully, the police here aren't complete assholes, so they took her to the hospital instead of jail. It took one of our staff and one of the cops three trips with a luggage cart to empty that room. She had been there a day and a half.

OL's husband finally showed up, but she had already been taken away. Hopefully, this will be a wake-up call to her loved ones that she needs more support.",33,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0C5A940>
447,Domestic Violence Situation,"One night while working my first hotel job, I was sitting at the desk minding my own business. My management allowed their employees to do whatever on the computers as long as they greeted guests and did other work in a timely manner. So, I was scrolling through Facebook when the front desk phone rang.

A man from room 318 complained of a couple loudly arguing next door to his room. This was around 2:30 in the morning. He said it sounded like it gotten violent as he heard a lot of banging around and the girl letting out a few screams. He said he called 911 for me so I thanked him and said I’d look into the situation and wait for the police to arrive.
After the phone call, a man comes downstairs from the elevator and asks to be checked out of room 319. The same room the man on the phone was just complaining about. Instantly I knew this must either be the boyfriend or husband. I didn’t know what to do but I knew I had his information on file and his face on camera so I avoided conflict and allowed him to check out. I told him since it’s so early and he’s checking out three days from now that it’d be treated as a cancellation. He just said okay and asked me to give him proof of the cancellation.

I printed out a paper but it must have been the wrong one because he looked pissed off yet he left in a big hurry anyway. Cops were nowhere to be seen yet so I posted about this occurrence in the group chat that was made for the hotel employees by management. My coworker advised me to go check on the woman as I reported she didn’t come down with the man so I hesitantly obliged as I don’t know how to handle these situations.

I went to the third floor and located their room and knocked on the door quietly. I could hear the TV blasting. I knocked louder and still no answer. So, I shouted out loud that I was a front desk employee and that I’m coming in. I used the guy’s key cards I hadn’t cancelled yet and opened the door to find an empty but completely destroyed room. The bedsheets and mattress protector were ripped off the bed and thrown in a pile, two pillows had weird red/brown stains on them, the iron had been thrown on the floor. There was ice-cream smushed into the tile in the bathroom and so much more. It was obvious that some shit had gone down inside that room. 

I left the room and found the guy who reported the incident to 911 in the lobby wanting something from the snack shop. He told me he had seen the girl leave with the man as he was heading downstairs. Which disappointed me, but I know a lot of domestic abuse victims think that their abuser is the only person who they can be with.

Anyways, the cops were taking an extremely long time and I didn’t know why. By 4:00am while I was putting breakfast out they still weren’t there, but when I was almost finished I had noticed red and blue flashing lights drive by and leave the property. Which means while I was putting breakfast out and attending to it, mind you I was in the back for two minutes, they had stopped by and decided not to wait and just leave. Pissed me off, like y’all couldn’t have waited two minutes for me so I could report the situation? Have y’all ID the man and see if there was anything you could do?
The whole situation was just a roller coaster and I’m glad it’s over with.",16,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0C5A9A0>

449,AITA For not forwarding packages?,"We've recieved a couple of small, suspisciously cell phone shaped packages in the mail the last couple days.

Come in via UPS. Name and address on the package is not for our property, but there is a smaller shipping label stamped on the bottom that is, with a different name and our address.

Looked up the name, found a guest due to arrive in a few weeks.

Get a call about an hour later, allegedly their girlfriend mailed them here by mistake, and they want me to forward them to them somewhere else.

Now, I've been in this game for many years, and have seen enough scams to know something is up here.

I tell them that they will be here when they arrive in a few weeks, but I will not forward packages.

Fedex arrives maybe an hour later, to pick up two packages, with... Surprise, that persons name on them.

I tell them no, I already told that person they could pick them up in person.

Queue next day... Repeat! Minus the phone call. Package arrives, same shape, different origin and original name, same small sticker with our address and the same guest name.

Fedex arrives an hour later, now saying they have multiple pick ups.

Again, nope. They can have them at check in.

Am I the asshole here for not participating in what I assume is mail fraud?

Can anyone think of a legitimate reason someone would mail something to a hotel weeks ahead of time, only to have them then try to ship the item somewhere else? SAME DAY?

Doesn't a Fedex pickup schedule take more than an hour notice to arrange? I've never dealt with that before.

TL:DR - Hotel doesn't play ball with likely credit card fraud.",111,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0C5AA60>
450,Entitlement at it's Finest,"**Warning: Long-Winded**  

I work at a hotel that caters to mostly long-term stay business. Our rooms come with a Kitchen, Microwave, and Refrigerator. *SOME* of our room types have an Oven inside, *SOME* of them don't. Otherwise it is a stovetop with 4 eyes in all rooms. Typically when a guest calls to make a reservation and makes it known that they *need* an oven, we let them know which room type does and does not have it before they make reservations so they can *request* this room type, before they check in. Management ordered a few toaster-ovens *(like 4 of them)* just in case we get anyone who insists on having an oven who doesn't in their room. We are down to 2 TOs now because the other 2 have gone missing (I.E Guests have walked out with them)

A lady guest approaches me on my first day back at work after having been sick and out of work for a little while. She tells me that she is here for more than a couple of months, and does not have an oven in her room. She wanted a toaster-oven, and asked for one last week from Front Desk, but couldn't get one because we apparently didn't have anymore extras. She'd heard from one of her co-workers who is also staying here, that we had extra ones and they were provided with one. Of course, whoever their co-worker is was given the last extra toaster-oven we had, and Oh, Joy I get to be the one to tell her that was our last one.

Upper Management who buys these extra items if we run out, is not in. They are out because their parent passed away suddenly, and so are dealing with a lot at the moment. Which means they're probably not looking at emails, or even worried about trivial guest issues like this one. I tell Miss Oven that unfortunately we're out of the small toaster-ovens at the moment. I went into the system as I'm speaking to her and also checked to see if we had a room type with an Oven that we could move her to so she could have one. Of course, we don't have one of those available either, they're all occupied. I told her we didn't have a room type with an oven we could move her to at the *moment*, but that as soon as one opened up, we would be more than happy to move her. Her next response was:

""Well, can't you just buy another toaster-oven?""

I tell her that I can certainly bring that to upper management's attention, and ask them if they could order her a small toaster-oven for her room, but that because management is out due to ""family emergency"", it may be next week before we get anymore in. Front Desk does not have access to the company credit card, obviously, but I figured there was no need to tell her that, as that should be common sense. She then says,

""Oh.....so that would be the same for the blender then?""

.....I'm sorry what? I asked her what she meant. She told me that she was also in need of a blender for her room so she could blend her medication. I struggled to keep a straight face. I told her *blenders* don't come standard in any of the rooms. That it's a personal item that guests can bring on their own if they wish, same as if someone needed a floor fan or a humidifier for their room. You would bring your own. I told her I could ""request"" the blender, but that it would just be a request, but that I highly doubted that would be provided, as it isn't a standard to have one.

She nods and says ok like she understands. I emailed management after that, asking what I should do for this guest, if any items would be ordered and when I should tell her to expect them if so. Of course, I don't get an immediate response.

Miss Oven doesn't even wait a day more before she approaches me again about her toaster-oven and blender. She again asked me if anyone had been notified and when she would get her items. At this point, because she was actually giving me attitude about this with her exasperated tone of voice, I went ahead and told her that the reason management hasn't gotten back to anyone immediately about this issue she was having was because Upper Management is currently dealing with the sudden death of their parent. I figured this would give her some kind of perspective and a little more patience and understanding about *waiting* for a response.

I reiterated that I had, in fact, emailed management about getting her a toaster-oven but that again, neither that or the blender come standard in the room. Circumstances being what they were, she would have to wait before getting any kind of response as to if and when they would be ordered. Pissed off, she leaves for work for the day. THANK GOD, later on, I had an early check out for one of the rooms that have an oven inside.

I immediately emailed her and called her cell phone and left her a voicemail about being able to move rooms. It would be a bigger bed in the room (a King versus the Queen she had now), it would be a studio size room, bigger than the One-Bedroom she had, but without the door to separate the living room from the bedroom area. She was alone in the room (from what we knew), so that should be okay. But I wanted to make sure before moving her in our system. The blender, I would certainly have to wait for because there was no way for me to rectify that without management stepping in and actually buying her one.

The next day: I come back into work to see a long email response from her that said,

**""No thank you. I’m staying at your hotel for almost four months and I will not be comfortable in a studio. I prefer the room that I currently have.** 

**This issue has really been disappointing and disheartening. I frequent your hotel brand often while traveling and never have had an issue of sorts. It has been a painful experience trying to get a toaster oven and blender. I have talked with three different people and received three different responses including a recommendation to another hotel. It is especially disappointing to hear from your staff that you don’t have toaster ovens when I know for a fact that a couple of my co-workers have been given one by the hotel.**

**At this point, I will purchase them myself. However, I do believe that a couple complimentary nights to be used on another trip is warranted in this situation.""**

There was nothing I wanted to do more in that moment than to tell her to FUCK OFF. First of all: your company is paying for you to stay here for more than a couple of months and you didn't think to call ahead and ask what came in any of our rooms? Second of all: you're staying here for more than a couple of months and you didn't think to bring your own blender for your medication, or even buy yourself a cheap little bullet blender for your medication, something that is important to you?? Third of all: I gave you an option to at least fix half of your issue, and you turn it down and then have the nerve to tell me you feel like you deserve to be compensated with a COUPLE of free nights at another hotel after that?

UM. No. Now you can fuck off and to hell with whatever other issues you have. I can be great, I can help out and do favors for those I feel deserve it and go above and beyond when I don't have to. But people like *this,* you can certainly kiss my ass, ma'am.",30,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0C5AAC0>
451,Unusual interaction.,"So this happen to me yesterday. 

I work in a airport hotel and we are inside the airport. We often get lost guest looking for their airline check-in wander into the hotel. This is one guest though...let's call him Mr. Smith. 

Me: Good morning, are trying check into the hotel sir?

Mr. Smith: Yes i have a booking. 

Me: Perfect what is your last name? \*i look up the reservation, it is there.\*

usually i would ask for a reservation # but it was pretty unique name.

Me: if I can get a piece of ID and Credit card please. 

guest hand's me the ID, it matches the name and i ask him to swipe the credit card. while he is doing that i go through his booking. 

Me: Okay Mr. Smith i see you are here for one night, in our king bed. 

then i go through the amenities. as i am making the room keys. 

Mr. Smith: so where do i check-in the bags? 

confused me: do you need me to take the bags to your room?

Mr. Smith: no i want to check in these bags and why would i need a room i am flying to my home. 

Me: sir this is an hotel? where do you think you are right now?

Mr. Smith: This is not Delta check in counter?

Me: Sir what made you think this the delta check in counter?

Mr. Smith: well you are in the airport aren't you? 

Me: Sir you walked past a giant door, then the doorman who greeted you, there is big sign that \*hotel brand\* and the front desk looks nothing like a airline check in counter. 

Mr. Smith: well you have lost my business forever, i will fly with untied. 

Me: sir did i not make it clear this is a hotel?

Mr. Smith just walked away without saying another word. 

then he struggles to find a way outta the hotel. like there is only one entrance, the same one he came through.",67,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0C5AB20>
452,Am I Unreasonable?,"We have 5 full time FDA's and 1 new hire in training.  One of them is the NA 5 nights a week, and only I and 1 other co-worker know how to do NA.  We used to trade off the other 2 NA shifts - me one week, her the next.  Lately, it has been just me doing the 2 other NA shifts.  Then, I usually have 2 days ""on call"" (never ""OFF) and 3 days of morning shifts. 

I sleep off and on during the day when I have the NA shift - it's difficult for me as I am a night owl.  I get a ridiculous amount of spam calls and texts every day, so I usually shut my phone off when I try to sleep.  Today, 2 of my co-workers called off - one is ""sick"" (she's sick every two to three days or has some type of emergency she has to handle) and the other had an ""emergency"" (also has to be off every couple of days due to being sick -never produces a doctors note - or some type of urgent business), so my GM was trying to contact me to come in so that I and another co-worker could basically work a 12 hour shift each.  My phone was off because I already knew I had to cover NA - today was not an ""on call"" day.

He is pissed off at me because I had my phone off.   I texted him back saying I was sorry but I had to shut it off so I could sleep.  He said I HAVE to leave it on at all times so he can reach me in an emergency.  That's totally fair if I had been on call but I had a shift scheduled and the way I see it, if he is the MANAGER, why didn't he cover the 3-11 if he couldn't get one of his staff to come in?

I think instead of working the 2 dependable FDA's to death, he should fire the flakes and replace them with people he can depend on.  I'm told (by a manager in another department) that if new hire works out, one of the flakes will be let go, but who knows if that will really happen.

Sorry if this is all over the place - I'm just at a complete loss with this bullshit.  Any and all advice will be much appreciated.",38,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0C5AB80>
453,I have no idea what you're talking about.,"So I work at a resort and we get some interesting folks. So one night around 2:00 a.m. I'm doing my usual night audit stuff and this woman comes running into my lobby. I asked her if everything's okay she says no that she just escaped from her boyfriend in one of our rooms, and that he's coming to find her. 

So immediately I stuff her in the back office, call security and call the police. Just as I'm getting off the phone with the police, the boyfriend shows up. I greet him with my cheeriest ""hello sir how can I help you?"" And he responds with his cheeriest ""shut the fuck up where is she?"" 

Now at this point I'm not sure whether he wanted me to shut the fuck up or tell him where she was, but I was going to do neither. So I respond with ""I have no idea what you're talking about sir"" all the while I am standing behind my desk clutching a piece of rebar that we definitely don't keep in the back to deal with people like this and was definitely left there by our maintenance staff accidentally, of course. 

So he starts looking around he runs off to the bathrooms in the lobby, comes back screaming, obviously frustrated, just as several deputies from the Sheriff's Department come into the lobby from the elevators.  It didn't get better from there. 

Two of the deputies took the guy aside to speak to him and the remaining deputy went In back to talk to the hopefully soon to be ex-girlfriend. And I'm trying to stay out of the way of everybody. 

So it all culminates in him screaming at the deputies the deputies then involuntarily putting him on the ground, and the very angry gentleman threatening to eat one of the deputies. It would probably be safe to say that this gentleman was methed out of his mind.

So more deputies show up and take him away, and they take the girlfriend's statement and she asks if she can still stay here for the night, she wasn't the problem and I looked the room up and it was in her name anyway so I told her yes she could stay. 

I didn't hear a peep out of her the rest of the night, she was gone the next day though, and thanks to Sunshine laws, I know that he is still in jail. I guess he can't afford to bail himself out and nobody wants to bail him out.",54,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0C5ABE0>
454,If you're dog is not a service animal go stay at a hotel that accepts pets,"I do not understand this. Yeah it sucks paying the pet fee at some of these hotels, but I feel like if you can't have someone (like a family member or friend) watch your dog, then going to a pet friendly hotel and paying an extra $50 or so (for the pet fee) is a nice second option. 

I love the people that are like ""Its a service animal"" and the little shit is like walking away off leash, jumping on our couches, barking or even having an accident is not proving to me that it is a service animal. An emotional support animal does not qualify as a service animal.  

Service animals are trained to take a specific action to assist a person with a disability. Service Animals are protected under the rules for Titles II and III of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). This means that service animals must be allowed any place the public is allowed, including [restaurants, hotels, and hospitals](https://www.ada.gov/regs2010/service_animal_qa.pdf). Dogs, and in some cases miniature horses, are the only animals that can be recognized as service animals under the ADA. Under Oregon State Law, service-animals-in-training are also protected.

Emotional support animals (sometimes called companion or comfort animals) provide disability-related emotional support. Emotional support animals are not specifically protected under the “in public” parts of ADA, and they do not have to be allowed into public spaces.

Straight from the ADA website.

I had some guy come in today and left his husky in the car, didnt bring it with him (Case #1 that is is not a service animal as you need them to go about your daily lifes) then while he is upstairs for a couple hours I can hear his dog barking and howling, echoing through the parking lot (Case #2). He asked if he could bring it inside cause its a ""SeRvIcE aNiMaL"" I told him regardless of if it truly is a service animal, we cannot have a dog barking in the hotel and disturbing guests. He said ""It only does that cause she was outside in the car"" yeah sorry not taking the chance on that.

It is my friday I am not taking any chances. Like most of you I like my fridays to be chill, and over quick. Noise complaints from guests saying there is a barking dog (when we are pet free, service animals aside obvi) is not what I would define chill. Also when we do let these questionable ""service animals in"" (or snuck in) we have to put the room down for days because they usually pee in the rooms, tear up something, or the room just smells like dog. 

Side tangent: A golden rule of a hotel  its easier to get someone into the hotel then to get someone out. Basically its easier to just check someone in then it is to kick someone out. We've had some guest that came in waving them redflags (and younger me) checked them in. Well they would cause noise compalints or smoke in the room, or I come to work the next day and read the shift notes of an incident at the hotel. Kicking them out is always a pain and there is usually a note that says ""took till 1-2 hours to get guests out of room"" ""Had to threaten to call the police to get guests to leave"" ""Had to CALL the police to get guests to leave""",138,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0C5AC40>
455,I refuse to take 20 dollars that someone threw at me and now my coworkers think I'm weird.,"I work as a night auditor so I may not see as many people as you day bois, but I think it's fair to say I see my fair share of strange people. Something has happened to me recently that has legitimately upset me, the more I think about it and I'd like some opinions.

The other night at about 3am a man comes in to the hotel and starts whistling to get my attention (I was in the back finishing up my audit away from view of the lobby) when I go out the man tells me he'll give me 20 dollars to yell something. (what he wanted me to yell was political in nature and vulgar.) I refused to say what he wanted and that seemed to only encourage him. He kept trying to get me to say it to which I replied ""I'm not your dog and you're beginning to irritate me, I need you to go back to your room."" he then screams at the top of his lungs what he was trying to get me to say, throws the money at me and begins to walk off to the elevators. When he got to the elevators I can hear him cussing me out and saying things I'd prefer not to repeat. I took the money and put it a drawer (not the cash drawer) and then typed up the incident for my pass on. At the end of my email I told my coworkers and managers where the money was and told them I didn't want it.

Now hindsight is 20/20 and the more I think about what had happened the more I wish I would have called the cops and had him booted from the hotel. I didn't know his name or room number and if I'd have followed him I'm pretty sure he would have started screaming and I'd have noise complaints galore as a result. However, what I'd really like to know is what's your opinion on the money? My coworkers are saying I should take it but I legitimately don't want it. Don't ask me why but it feels as if I take it he's ""won"". It's gotten to the point though that people think I'm strange for just letting it sit there in the drawer. So what do you guys think?",72,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0C5ACA0>
456,Possible prostitute with all the issues,"Edited to add nicknames instead of all the pronouns.  Also for a better word choice. Hopefully my edits make sense.

CBFS--cousin best friend something that allowed DP into room. 

DP-druggie prostitute 

CR-coworker/roommate 

RD-random dude


This is going to be a long story.  We have a group of 30 workers staying here, they are sharing rooms. Their company is paying for the rooms.

This started early Friday morning,  a DP in the lobby, for about an hour, on the guest computer.  She was drinking a ton of tea. I ended up getting a call to be forwarded to a room, I ask for the name associated with the room which was a female name. There are 2 male names, that are workers names, on the account,  I refuse to transfer the call. As I'm saying the name, I hear a small voice in the lobby saying it was her name.  I tell her that someone was outside waiting for her.

The CR on the account checks in with me after she leaves.

When cleaning up the lobby later, I see that DP was still signed into Facebook.  She had messaged someone saying she ""was uncomfortable and felt unsafe, she went to a guy's room and he asked her to take off her boots and get under the covers.""  I'm glad she got herself out of the situation that she felt unsafe in and close the Facebook page.

The next morning,  DP comes in when the workers are leaving. The room she was supposedly in was part of this group of workers.  She goes down the hallway and disappears.  The workers leave and I see her on the computer again.  

When morning shift arrives, I tell her about the DP, what I saw and the possible association with the room.  DP goes to grab breakfast and my coworker asks me to go check what was on the computer.  DP had a 3 way messenger argument going on and they were talking about drug usage. 

My coworker wonders if the workers let her into the room. We go down the hallway and find the door latched open. At this point, the workers had left over an hour ago, DP has been in the lobby that long, so we close the door.  Anyone could have walked in the room and stolen items.  We call the phone number on the account and leave a message that we found the door open.

DP goes down the hallway again, finds the door closed and demands we let her into the room. I ask her what room, it was the room which was called about the previous morning and was latched open. I ask her for a name associated with the account, she said it was her ""cousin's best friend something"" and she didn't have a name. DP says we can see her on camera go into the room. We explain we can't give her a key, her name isn't on the account. DP demands we call the guest, I leave another message to CBFS asking if it was OK that DP was allowed into the room. Two minutes later, DP asks that we call again, I leave yet another message.  I tell her more than likely they are somewhere that they don't get good cell phone reception at.  She told me to stop being negative. 

CBFS calls before 1030 am, tells my coworker to give her a key. Dp then spends the rest of the day going in and out, having guests over and demanding stuff from the front desk. 2nd shift had major complaints about her and  demands.   

I only see DP once Saturday/Sunday night and she looks high as she wanders in.  She tells me a car drove up to her in the parking lot and kept offering her drugs. She wanted us to know about the shady car/people.

Sunday night comes around, 2nd shift tells me she had to call the police on DP.   CR comes to the room in the afternoon with food, finds DP in the room with some random dude. They were doing drugs. The CR leaves, eats his food in the lobby and tells 2nd shift what happened.  2nd shift gets a call from CBFS, asking that we throw DP out due to upsetting CR. 

2nd shift goes to the room and knocks on the door, the RD in the room is upset that my coworker was aggressively knocking on the door to get them to answer. RD starts to yell at her, she tells him he isn't the guest staying the room; that she is looking for the DP.  DP comes to the door, 2nd shift tells DP that CBFS wants DP to leave. DP started to yell and scream at my coworker how she was lying, that she was paying CBFS to stay in the room, and that DP was going to call the police to let her stay in the room. The RD in the room was acting extremely aggressive with my coworker. 

Several of the coworkers have joined the situation at this point due to CR calling them. They tell her to leave, the company was paying for the room. That everything she was doing was wrong.  That the CR and CBFS could get in trouble due to DP's actions. 

2nd shift got fed up with the situation, said she was calling the police since DP and RD weren't leaving. As she gets to the desk,  DP calls 911.  The 911 operator ends up calling back to the hotel and to find out what is happening. When 2nd shift was on the phone explaining the situation, the DP and RD  leave. 

CR wants to move rooms, he doesn't feel safe and doesn't know what DP has done or where in the room. CR is pissed because DP has eaten his food, the room is wreaked, and there is drug paraphernalia all around.  CR grabs his stuff and leaves the CBFS items in the room. CR refuses to touch CBFS stuff.

2nd shift rekeys the room, so if the DP comes back she can't get in. When the police show up, several hours later, they ask us to call if the DP comes back. 

As 2nd shift is telling me the story,  we go and check out the room.  CBFS's stuff is all over the place and we can still see drug items on the bed/furniture.  My coworker said there were more drug items in the room when she originally talked to the DP. Supposedly CBFS is coming back tonight so he can work in the morning.  CBFS is going to have to pack all his stuff to move to the new room. 

Considering how I've heard the crew leads/bosses meetings about issues with the crew in the mornings, I think that CBFS who allowed this DP into a company paid room might have some problems due to his actions/decisions.  The leads go over everything from sleeping issues, working issues and other items in a mini-meeting they have before they leave for the day.

I'll update if anything else happens.

457,Warning: Onomatopoeia Ahead,"So I mentioned this story over on the Discord channel, and figured I might as well inflict it upon my readers. You're welcome.

Tonight, gentle readers, we shall speak of sex. 

Not too loud though, you'll make Buttercup blush.

We all know that a certain percentage of the guests at a hotel are there to do more than just sleep. For some it's just people in a committed relationship having fun. For others, it's a business transaction. Still more are sneaking off for a little clandestine meetup. Point being, people have sex in hotels.

As my fellow Deskies can attest, we can usually tell who it is, too. There's the obvious call girls, going through the lobby on heels that would make Buttercup wince. There was the professional dominatrix who was working in 102 for a while (no actual sex stuff, apparently). There was the guy who was here for a week on business and had at *least* two girls visit his room every night. Yikes. 

So it came to pass that many years ago, back when I had first started working at this hotel, way back when we were still a Holy Crap Espresso, I was working the front desk when two gentlemen checked in. Older gents, maybe late 50s early 60s, nothing terribly remarkable. Standard greeting, credit card, paperwork, keys to 206 given.

Now there are some features that one should know about room 206. FIrst, it is located directly over the back office. Second, the floors are a bit thin, a flaw with a large portion of the hotel I'm afraid. Third, and I didn't realize this at the time, it is a Single King room.

These gentlemen were not here to sleep.

I shall now attempt to convey as best I can the exact sounds I heard. Clear your mind. Think of a calm, serene meadow. Quiet but for the gentle breeze blowing through it. Peaceful. Tranquil.

Now imagine the sound of a walrus being beaten to death with a two-by-four.

\*WHACK WHACK WHACK\* ""Urrrgh!"" \*WHACK *WHACK* WHACK\* ""Eeeuuurrrgh!"" \*WHACK WHACK\* ""Hnnnngh!""

Yeah.

This went on for about fifteen minutes or so, which given the age of the participants, I have to be a bit impressed. After that, everything was quiet except for one mildly shocked front desk agent who hadn't realized just how thin the floors were until that point.

In any case, I hope everyone is having a good night. Give Buttercup a hug and take care.

458,"Surprisingly, it's not the homeless guests who are the problem","I work night audit at a motel. Recently said motel struck a contract with the county's homeless temp housing program; they pay us a generous rate, we house the homeless folks who are on the program.

Now I know, some of you may be thinking, ""Rowdy guests! Broken stuff! Constant police calls! People pissing in the hallways! ~~Playing Toaplan shmups instead of Touhou or CAVE games!~~""

Surprisingly, two weeks into this program, it's been smooth sailing! We've only had one guest that I've seen be particularly problematic, namely someone who tends to make very dramatic phone calls to the front desk about some issue or another. Thankfully that's been resolved and we haven't had them going Baby Mario on us for about a week now.

It also helps that these folks have more simple paperwork to fill out, which makes checking their records easier during bucket checks. They just have to read and sign a copy of the program rules, no deposit required. This does mean that if they break stuff we have no way to really recoup the damage, but for that reason, management removed all fragile items from the rooms. And most of these folks don't have cars, so that's pretty much killed off ""there's no parking..."" complaints caused by multiple guests each parking two cars for a single room.

On top of that we have a couple of officers from the program who are using a few of our rooms for their offices, so if anything comes up involving the homeless guests, we just have to call them and they'll take care of the problem for us.

Instead, the problem has been coming from *other* guests.

One of our regulars declared their intent never to stay here again because the homeless program booked and paid for all the rooms, filling up our inventory. Another guest didn't like that we were housing homeless people here, so they ragequit and cancelled their stays. Granted, these problems don't affect me, but I feel bad for my fellow front desk frontliners who may have to deal with them acting like this is all the front desk department's fault.

And perhaps my biggest concern is that it is harder to convince folks trying to rent rooms that we are sold out. 

Recently someone walked in to try to rent a room. I told them we were sold out, which was true, and they pretty much called bullshit on my claim, because ""the parking lot isn't even half full and you have a few rooms that look empty!"" Well, mate, even if we weren't housing homeless people who don't have vehicles, ever heard of carpools? I still distinctly remember checking in a group of five guests a few years ago who all came in via cab, and therefore had no car here. Also we still had one arrival left, and that arrival prepaid for their res, so I was not going to fuck them over. For all he knows, the 2-3 empty rooms he saw could've also been for arriving guests who booked and paid for their rooms already. But no, this fool thinks I just don't want to rent to him, rather than that I *can't* rent to him. The guy ragequit and left the property, threatening to ""report"" me, whatever that meant. In hindsight, I should've asked him to go to our hotel website (or even one of those third-party booking sites like Crapedia or Bloking.com) and try to book a room for tonight, as that would confirm to him that we are genuinely sold out.

So now, I'm dreading this conversation every time we are sold out, that the next walk-in who I inform ""we're sold out"" is probably going to accuse me of discriminating against them or otherwise lyigng because our parking lot looks empty.

Anyways, thank you for calling the Ass Hotel. How may I help you today?",30,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0C5ADC0>
459,I think the Sales Manager is sabotaging us.," 

Hi! Just like to start with the basic information so there can be a clear understanding of what is going on and why I say the things that I say about the Sales Manager we will *kindly* refer to as Ursula. Only, the fabulous sea witch was much more charming than the woman I have the displeasure of working with.

The property I work at is only about 4 months old at this point. I was part of the opening team. Now, there's only eight people in the entire hotel that's still around. Two of which are the GM and AGM. But before the we got to work in the hotel we had a few meetings to get to know each other and train, the basics of opening a new hotel. It was during one of these meetings that we all met Ursula.

She walked in, unannounced and basically wanted a round of applause for being there. Like we were lucky to be graced with her presence. She introduced herself as the Director of Sales for the company (not even the direct property's sales manager- we have a different one that only works for our hotel but is only here maybe once a week and doesn't even know how to properly put in a group block.) and then she goes on to explain that she is a pain in the ass to work with and everyone she knows calls her a bitch, and she revels in it! How girlboss of her! It's an entire monologue about how she expects the impossible, but that's because she's passionate about her job and getting results. *Not a great start when only one of your front desk staff is fully trained and the rest are already nervous about doing something new.*

After this introduction she pulled the managers aside and had a little meeting with them that we could all hear inside the room next door. I couldn't believe how she was talking to two experienced managers! The AGM was the one that trained me years ago. She deserved more respect than what she was being given. It was like Ursula was talking to children. Explaining to them how a hotel works? Yes, they've been doing this for years. They know how teamwork works and how hospitality works? Even I felt insulted listening to it.

Then we opened and things were fine for a while. Besides the fact that there was ONE person in house on opening day. Only one. She did no advertising for it. She did no special discount to draw in crowds. It was completely dead for the first few weeks. Ursula was as demanding as she said she was though. Requiring all three shifts to send in a shift report which consisted of the occupancy, the due outs, the arrivals, the no shows, and other numbers like that. Things that *don't really change at all during the day shift.* But she needs them every eight hours! There also needed to be a section on any notes to pass along- only *we should only add things relevant to her and the district manager* but gave us no criteria on what that was. And she didn't like it if we put things alluding to a mistake made by her on the shift report .

She expects the front desk to sell out the property every weekend. Last time I checked that was her job, right? What can I do tethered to a desk for eight hours, especially when I'm not allowed to budge on the rate at all. All rate adjustments had to go through her or the property sales manager. She sent a bitchy email saying that we had to charge all the credit cards every day during the day shift and cancel them if they decline and don't answer the phone to give a new card. Which of course has caused many problems. Everything from People being upset their room was canceled because they couldn't answer their phone, they were on a flight to fraud charges because the card on file wasn't theirs to double charges because they wanted to use a different card when they got to the hotel. All because there was two no-shows on a night we almost sold out.

But the email went on to blame the front desk on the poor occupancy of the property and if we didn't start selling out she would turn on oversell and purposefully oversell us on busy nights.

She also chooses the worst companies to give discounts to. She has picked a bar around the corner to give a almost 50% discount to, and the patrons we get from there have never *not* caused a problem. I got bitched at because one of those distinguished guests fell asleep in his car WHILE IT WAS RUNNING and while he was parked in front of the only entrance to the parking garage and I had to call the cops to get him awake and get him to move- and because HE decided to drink and drive they took him to jail. Duh. But I was in the wrong for that according to Ursula. Even though it was a HIGH TEIR member that notified me of the situation because they couldn't get in to park their car.

She meddles often, sending notes on hot to properly do our jobs. Like we have no idea how to check people in. And it's usually paired with dumb shit like 'make sure there's fresh WARM cookies for them' but also check them in quickly. So, don't ever leave the desk, which we would have to do to make cookies.

She told the breakfast staff that a sports team would be staying at the property one weekend and that they would need breakfast open at 5:30 am (she had promised them this would be available when they requested it before booking, according to her). Usually on weekends it started at 7:00 am. But no problem. The breakfast takes pride in their department and wanted to make the guests happy. But, the kicker was 5:30 rolls around, then 6 nobody came down. They had never requested it. They had no idea what the breakfast ladies were talking about.

She also is in charge of our snack shop. Which is overpriced even for a hotel. She also charges tax on the food items when our state doesn't have a food tax. She also taxes pet fees, and for a while the refundable deposit.

But the latest kicker happened last week. When it snows in our area every hotel is on edge knowing that a certain power company will need rooms. And they usually completely book out entire hotels because there are thousands of men coming in to help with aftermath of a winter storm. But our sales manager REFUSED THEIR CALL for days. Then refused to lower the rate (that she raised from 129 to 149 to price gouge people without power) when they did ask for a rate. We had eight people in house all week when every other hotel was at full capacity. She kept insisting that they would 'pay the rate'. They obviously didn't.

The hotel hasn't been sold out in months, despite being brand new with glowing reviews and in a downtown location. The last major company sale was made by ME. I was the one that contacted the company. They're the only reoccurring company to book with us. Everyone she brings in causes problems, from the bar people to the other restaurant owner she knew that had a fight after a wedding at our party. She questions why rooms are our of order, but comps rooms for her friends?

She doesn't reply to good reviews about breakfast (because she has beef with the breakfast manager) but when it's a review that says something negative she's quick to get on and throw breakfast under the bus.

She also sends her assistants to come in and bitch at us. Her assistant came in and full on CHEWED OUT the GM and the AGM for *talking to each other* about things outside of work. The guests apparently shouldn't see them socializing according to Ursula.

There was also an incident where they advertised our tiny firepit as an 'outdoor lounge' and didn't tell us it was 'rented' until that morning. The firepit hasn't been operable since we opened, there's something wrong with it's gasline. First shift got SCREAMED at for not making this aware to the sales department, because people payed to use the outdoor lounge! *They didn't.* And the assistant bought two large propane heaters costing a ridiculous amount of money. *and the people didn't even use it.* They chose to stay inside and drink instead.

Ursula also apparently says who can be fired. Because she was upset and everyone from the AGM to the 2nd shift worker to me, the night auditor got bitched out because on Thanksgiving the company gave housekeeping off. (this was also the same Thanksgiving that Ursula declined a party of 55+ people for a family gathering. when we had 7 in house for the holiday, but they all booked through online travel agency and got cheaper rates anyway. . .) So rooms were left dirty in the system that night, which was fine. Except oversell was turned on so people were booking into rooms we didn't have. Having been in situations like this before I called the AGM, who verified that I needed to put the rooms out of order to keep them from selling.

I apparently was wrong for doing this? I should have *sold the dirty rooms anyway.* And the head housekeeper got fired for not cleaning all 50 dirty rooms when UPPER MANAGEMENT (regional) was the one that called off all housekeepers.

I'm sure there's more, but my fingers are tired from typing and I have to run audit. I just wanted to vent and rant and hear some reactions to the shenanigans!",36,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0C5AE20>
460,We have an apartment complex staying at our property.......,"So we have had an apartment complex staying at our property and it has been a nightmare!!!  To give some context there are two sets of low income housing projects in my town that are renovating the apartments and have moved people out in groups.  We are a relatively small property of about 50 rooms.  We have had a shooting in the parking lot,  multiple fights, and a front desk agent assaulted by one of these guests.  I am not the type to look down on anyone, and most have been decent guests, but this is getting out of hand.  I am seriously considering telling my GM that I do not feel safe working here anymore and just cutting my losses.  The GM I work for is sketchy to say the lease ( He is also the owner of the property)  His wife who used to work day shift now does not work because she ""doesn't like our guests"" now while the rest of the staff is expected to just put up with it.  Have any of you had any experiences like this before? Hopefully they all leave soon!!",18,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0C5AE80>
461,Cat in the Closet,"Alrighty folks I’ve been in the Front Office and doing MOD shifts for awhile and thought I had seen it all, but boy was I proven wrong last week. For context I was doing an evening MOD shift at my property. 

So the night before my story takes place a guest in one of our townhouses (our property has a number of townhouse units that are kinda like condos, really cool rooms!) reported hearing a cat meow. The overnight team had looked around and didn’t see any stray cats anywhere and thought that was the end of the story, but of course it wasn’t. 

Fast forward almost 24 hours and it’s mid evening on my shift, and the same guest calls and says there is a cat in their closet. I was speechless for a few minutes and had to ask the guest to repeat themselves, but yes indeed they said there was a cat in the closet of their unit. Naturally basically everyone went out to the room and lo and behold there was a cat in the closet. With the assistance of a broom and thick gloves we were able to catch the cat and an associate took it to to vet and then home. 

So, if you are out there and think you have seen everything don’t get to comfy, there might be A CAT IN THE CLOSET.",15,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0C5AEE0>

463,The Tale of How I Was Terminated After a Decade of Service and What Comes Next,"Hello again, TFTFD, and perhaps, farewell. A couple weeks ago I shared [this story](https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheFrontDesk/comments/rwieav/the_would_be_valet_theives/) about how some thieves attempted to steal some cars out of our secure garage and wanted to provide some follow up.

Immediately after the incident, GM had HR call one of our longest working, most dedicated, and loyal valets down to HR and wanted him to admit that he wasn't following proper procedures and protocols. He was. Also, he had nothing to do with the incident at all. But it turns out, GM wanted to pin it on someone, have someone fired to be made an example of, and then implement new policies and procedures and pretend that those were already in place. Now fortunately, valet has a strong union, so when GM drafted new procedures and wanted all the valets to sign, they took them to their union as the terms and conditions of their contract were being violated, without getting into specifics. I really hope that works out well for them, they're solid guys.

My authoritarian GM also wanted my Director, who is frankly one of the most supportive bosses I've ever had, to fire someone involved with the incident and set an example. Frankly, however, she's been protective of her team and refused, and instead turned in her two weeks notice, and from all the shit she's been put through from GM, I don't blame her at all. She was a great boss and I'd work for her again in a heartbeat. GM then immediately made the Director of Housekeeping the Interim Director of Front Office as well. I'm not going to get into the specifics, but Mr. Housekeeping does not know how to effectively run the front office, constantly throws other people under the bus, is super passive aggressive and petty and will talk about line-level staff behind their backs to other staff (super unprofessional and unbecoming), disregards existing policies, procedures, and contract union agreements if they are in the way of his agenda, and is such a boot licking lapdog to the GM that he is often referred to, cattily, as the Assistant GM behind his back by his peers and subordinates, which is fitting and poetic. Needless to say, we clashed. Also, he wanted to hold other people accountable to rules he held himself above, such as a stayover policy for employees facing inclement weather (snowstorm) to stay at the hotel. The policy stated that employees could stay on property, however could not have a guest, spouse, or significant other with them. Mr. Housekeeping would constantly remind others of this rule, and everyone followed the rules, with the bold exception of Mr. Housekeeping, who would hypocritically drag his boyfriend from across the street up to his room- on camera- in the wee hours of the morning. I know because he would pass my desk and I would wish them goodnight.

So fast forward to last week. In the middle of the week, I notice that Mr. Housekeeping is staying over in a comp room, with a note on his reservation that simply reads ""FIX FRONT OFFICE PROCEDURES APPROVED BY GM."" Odd, but I note it. I also note that he has already changed some policies and procedures for the front desk, and my actual Director hasn't even finished her two weeks yet. Usurper much? I find it odd. I also get a text from my real boss letting me know that they wanted her to come in early to cover the front desk at 6:30 am. I'm on until 7, and we both find that unusual. She declined, and said that she would firmly be in at 7, but gave me the heads up that something felt weird about it. Then my Security guy also told me that they had been asked to cover the desk at 6:30 after my boss had declined, and I knew then that I was going to be pulled aside to HR at the end of my shift and possibly eliminated. See, the new GM had a habit lately of waiting to eliminate people as a surprise at the end of their shift, as he had recently done so to some other managers and supervisors in other departments. Trimming the fat in times of famine, I assume. Except this felt somehow more personal.

So 6:30 in the morning rolls around and I'm tense. Nothing. 6:35. Nothing. If there's one thing I hate more than a surprise ambush, it's a surprise ambush that's running late. My boss comes in early anyway at 6:45 to check on me. That's when I get the call from HR. Well, time to hold my chin high and go out like a man. I head down to HR. HR Director is sitting there with a big smile. Mr. Housekeeping is sitting in a chair off to the side, flush and solemn, staring into his lap like a guilty dog that just shit on the living room floor. Maybe he did, I wouldn't put it past him. The whole ordeal, he doesn't say a word, and won't make eye contact with me. HR Director goes through the motions, I'm sorry, it's not you it's us, you did nothing wrong, we're eliminating your position to serve the needs of the business... *Bullshit*, I think, but I keep quiet. Here are my healthcare options, I am able to be rehired and work for other locations in the company if I want, so long and thanks for all the fish. Oh, and here's a severance package of eight weeks pay for your ten years of service if you want, but you have only seven days to sign it and there's language in it that strips away all your legal rights and claims against the company as well as language that would hold you accountable to destroy any documentation of claims against us for any wrongdoing we may have done and also if you say anything bad about the hotel ever to anyone even in passing we can sue you and make you pay back the entire puny severance as well as pay for all your own legal fees when we pile on a smorgasbord of charges on you if we feel so inclined. Get wrecked. I'll have my attorney look it over, but there's not a chance in hell I'm signing it. Especially since I opened a case with BOLI just a month and a half earlier since the hotel would not provide the overnight shift with adequate breaks and lunches as mandated by state law. Not going to get into that further here, but like hell I'll relinquish my rights for a small severance that they can take back anyway if they feel like it and then some.

So I cleaned out my locker, turned in my keys, said my goodbyes, and was escorted out of the building and off the property by security. After ten years of loyal service. After working through most of the pandemic, having to do multiple people's jobs way beyond my job description for no additional pay, after having to endure harassment from clientele that haven't taken the pandemic seriously and not getting proper PPE from the hotel and having it take a huge toll on my mental health, and being denied my legally mandated breaks and lunches. After all the bullshit, just, thank you, next. I gave that place my blood, sweat, and tears, and put myself in the line of fire countless times to try and make my work environment better for my teammates, and was rewarded with a swift *go fuck yourself.* But perhaps it's for the best, as working through this pandemic has made me reevaluate working not only in hospitality, but working with the general public as a whole. Perhaps it's time for a career move and this might have been the swift kick to get me out and into something else. Silver linings, I guess.

Front Desk workers: You guys are the best. You do more than you know to keep hotels running and are grossly overworked and underpaid for what you do. Believe me, I know. If you aren't in a union, and you feel like you aren't getting paid enough, or your benefits aren't as good as union benefits, or maybe your workload is unfair and overburdening, or maybe you just want collective bargaining so you can have a seat at the table and a say in your job, honestly, I would give organizing a union a fair shot. Seriously, now is the time where you'll have more leverage than you know. Companies are hurting for workers, at least in the US, since many don't want to pay living wages or offer decent benefits or a healthy work/life balance, so that gives workers a lot of power in terms of organizing and fighting for their rights. You guys deserve the best, and don't ever let anyone try to convince you otherwise. You work hard and you care about your job and the hotel experience would not be the same without you. Hell, the hotel would not be able to function properly if it weren't for the front desk. You have power. Remember that.

Guests: Be nice to front desk workers. And for fuck's sake, just wear the damn mask and don't argue. The Front Desk agent in front of you doesn't need to hear you piss and moan about '*muh freedumbs*,' they're just trying to do their job and not die in a pandemic. Be a considerate adult, put the mask on, and get over yourself. You don't have to wear it outside, you don't have to wear it in your room, and I don't give a shit what they're doing (or not doing) in Florida or wherever, but if you're trying to check into a hotel that requires you to wear a mask, you agree to follow the rules if you want to stay. Otherwise, you can pound sand and go somewhere else. DO NOT GIVE THE FRONT DESK AGENT A HARD TIME FOR THIS. They have enough shit to deal with already.

Tales From The Front Desk Readers: It's been a pleasure. Maybe I'll be back, maybe I won't, but I'll always lurk, and read those horror stories. Make good choices.",26,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0C5AFA0>
464,We'e not monsters that are trying to keep you from peeing,"I work in a downtown hotel that has had a problem with homeless people ever since we opened in 2008. I want to start off by saying that I don't hate homeless people, I just don't have compassion for the ones that aren't doing anything to better their situation, or ones that keep coming back to the property after we've kicked them out. 

I had 3 homeless people in the lobby today. Two were the typical ones we deal with, I.e ""I just wanted a coffee, my wife is in the bathroom, we were going to rent a room after"". I got them out when I said we don't take cash deposits anymore. Credit card only. The other was one I did feel bad for. It was a young guy, maybe even a kid (meaning 18-19) that looked like he was having a rough go. I let him charge his phone in the lobby. I did have to ask him to leave eventually because it seemed like he would have stayed all day if I would have let him. I locked the entrance once they all left. But they're not the point of my tale today. 

There was a peaceful protest outside today, walking down Main Street with their signs. I saw a fee different signs, so I'm not sure what the protest was actually for. Some had signs for funding for mental health (which I support), others had them for the truck drivers (the province closed the borders to truck drivers that aren't vaccinated, so we're expecting shortages for things like meat and milk), and some others, but again not the point of my post. 

It's about the bathrooms. Because of the issue with homeless people, and during big events downtown like the Santa Claus Parade, we say that we don't have public bathrooms. We do have bathrooms on the main floor, but for guests. While the protest was going past, a couple must have left the group when I wasn't in the lobby and tried to get inside. I thought it was an arrival so I opened the door. They asked to use the bathroom. I said we don't have public bathrooms. The lady took her mask off and let it hang on one ear to say ""you DON'T have bathrooms??"", then the guy said ""I've been here before, do you want me to show you where the bathrooms are?"" With that comment I said ""fine, go ahead"". I waited in the office until they left, just in case he wanted to call me a bitch or something. 

Maybe half an hour or so after the protest passed, two women came up to the doors so I opened them. Asking for the bathroom. Instead of fighting with them, I told them where to go. One said ""thank you, the hotel up the street wasn't as nice"". I wanted to talk to them before they left to explain why hotels turn people away for the bathroom. I didn't mention the homeless people because they probably would have felt insulted, but I just explained that we're not supposed to let anyone in that isn't a guest. She started to go off about the other hotel, so I actually did cut her off (which I never do) to say ""I get it, but just don't hold it against them"". I saw the shift in her face that she understood and thanked me for explaining that. I wanted to say ""we're not monsters that don't want to let you pee, but we do need to keep the hotel safe for the people inside"". 

Sorry for the long post, stay safe everyone!",32,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0C5B040>
465,Invasion of the Tween Fangirls,"I'm not sure I can say the name of the person who is giving a concert, but think side ponytail, giant stupid bow wearing girl and you will know who I mean.

We were nearly full last night, we are down to ONE functioning washing machine, and we employ some of the slowest housekeepers known to the industry - I'm talking arrive at 9 and by 12 have ONE room cleaned - so I have to enforce the 3 pm check in time.  

Beginning at 1 pm, I have had a steady stream of the fangirls and moms wanting to check in.  The moms, for the most part, have been understanding, but their little diva darlings have destroyed my last nerve!  Whining they HAVE to get ready and do their hair like ""her"".  Seriously, kid - it'll take 5 minutes tops - it's a fucking high side ponytail with a stupid bow.  And of course, they ALL have to show off their dancing because they dance ""just like her"".  If you say so - I've never seen her perform, nor do I want to.   One crashed into the glass entry doors and fell to the floor, screeching, one hit the table and fell (luckily her head whacked on the couch and not the heavy wooden table), and a couple of them crashed into each other while they were showing off.  Not one parent said so much as a syllable to any of them.

I know I'm a grumpy old broad and I do get the excitement of what is probably your first concert, but come on parents - rein your little brats in.

466,Late night fun,"I had a last minute reservation come through tonight around 1215 from hometomorrow. No biggie, I don't run audit until 3 if I have an arrival left. The woman comes to check in shortly after and doesn't have a credit card for incidentals. No problem, she says she'll be back with her boyfriend to check in later and asks what the latest time they can check in is. 

They arrive back at the hotel at 245, I ask for ID and card. He asks if we take apple pay. No. Goes outside, stands outside the door for a few minutes, then texts the gf to let him back in. Weird but what ever. I ask for his ID as well. ""But my picture is on the card"". Sorry I need a government issued ID. Goes back outside to try to find it. GF starts asking if I ""hassle"" everyone like this or if it's just them because they are black. I tell her I follow policy which is to get a government issued ID that matches the name on the card. 

She continually speaks over me and will not accept my answer. Finally I tell her if she continues I'll just cancel the reservation, because at this point I'm over it, and she can find other accommodations. Again throws out the race card nd that she is not being ""and aggressive black woman"". I straight up tell her that that is not what I'm saying, and that she is arguing with me about policy. 

FINALLY dude calls to be let in again. No ID but he has a picture of it! No can do, I need it physically in front of me. They ask about a refund, I tell them they'll have to go through the OTA they booked through. 

Why does it always surprise people when I need an ID that matches the person and the credit card? Or that I need a credit card on file for incidentals?  This is not the first time this has happened and the individual in front of me accused me of racism either.

467,First Incident with a Resident,"I work at the front desk of a dorm at college. I wrote about this encounter in an email to my superiors (so the wording might be formal and a little odd) but thought I would share it with you all.

At 8:45pm on Saturday, 1/22/2022, a girl was locked out of her room because she did not have her key on her when she left her room. I politely called the RA on Duty to let him know. I asked her to sign the lock-out slip. She said that she had not had to sign it before and wondered why she needed to today. I said that some RAs don't enforce it especially depending on time of day, but it was my job to give it to her. She got upset when she realized she would have to pay $7.50. She called her roommate/friend to come down and talk to me. 

Her friend came down within a few minutes and stomped over to me, immediately snapping at me asking why they would have to pay $7.50 when they didn't lock their door. I did my best to remain calm and respectful and informed them that it is their responsibility to always have their key on them if they leave their room. If we have to unlock the door, we charge $7.50. They both refused at that and raised their voices at me. The friend was trying to intimidate me by standing over me, talking down to me, and telling me to do my job. I just repeated that they should have their key on them if they leave their room. They both nearly shouted that they didn't lock it so they shouldn't have to pay. 

The RA arrived and talked to them, they both continue disrespecting both of us, yelling, talking over us, and demanding to not have to pay. At one point the friend was talking very loudly and rudely over me, so I stood up to be able to talk to her eye to eye. They saw this as a sign of disrespect and told me to stop treating them like I was their mother. I kept my tone as calm as I could, which was difficult as they wouldn't let me get a word in. After arguing for 15 minutes, they got a friend to open the door so they left. One girl came back and said she is close to someone in housing and will be reporting me for my horrible behavior. 

I believe I handled this the best way I was able to. I snapped at them a little, but only after they yelled at me and wouldn't listen to a word I said. They insulted me and told the RA he was letting ""someone like that"" talk to them.",46,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0C5B160>

469,Why would you leave that in the sink?,"I work at a long term (extend stay) hotel. My manager started her vacation yesterday and left me instructions to demand one of our guests accept intensive stay over service, or he will be evicted. 

He has been at our hotel for a little over a month and he is a slovenly type guy and his room smells foul and is very messy. 

I send my newest housekeeper up to his room with the instructions that the guy must accept the service. Housekeeper comes back and states the guy won’t get out of bed. I’m like no, that’s not happening. I call up to his room and tell him get up and let my housekeeper in. Guy says ok. Housekeeper returns and says the guy let him in but refused service. I’m like NO (again…).

Grab my maintenance man, grabbed my housekeeper and up we went. Knock and the guy opens the door. I explain he will accept service, or he is evicted then and there. He relents and we all three walk in. 

I go in the bathroom and he has a live carp swimming in the bathtub and a pooped smeared butt plug in the sink. Housekeeper is right behind me and says “NO”. 

I called to my maintenance man and said let’s go. We all three left the room. Went back to the office, called up there and told the guest to leave immediately. 

He did, taking the carp but leaving the butt plug.",44,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0C5B220>
470,A wholesome update to my previous post about an elderly guest and our conflict of self and morals.,"For anyone that remembers, I previously posted a story about an elderly guest who was living on our hotel property in her car when she could no longer afford her room. I was conflicted in if I should call someone, who I should call, and the fear of repercussions of getting involved. Thanks to everyone who gave me their input, and onto the wholesome result.

So I followed the advice of commenters and went to my GM about it. I had received her blessing about phoning DCF (department of family services also adult protective services). They suggested we phone our local PD for a welfare check.

Fast forward welfare check is done, and she flees the property I guess afraid of why the police knocked on her window. DCF sent out a social worker and found her over at a diner next door and did an assessment. Some time goes by and we don't hear anything. 

Today my GM and I received a picture and a text. DCF has placed her in another hotel in another location, has acquired her a walker to help her be more mobile without falling and are actively looking for housing for her. 

At the end of the day, company policy aside, I feel we so strongly did the right thing and I'm so grateful that we were able to help someone who really needed it. The front desk business sucks most days, but it's times like these that make me feel so grateful to be in the right place at the right time. And exactly why I feel I wouldn't want to be anywhere else but behind the front desk.

471,Pretty sure I just almost got punched in the face,"Hi all! I work nights at a small-ish hotel (160 rooms), we're the newest and also the cheapest hotel in town. So nice modern looking hotel, cheap prices... we're kinda popular. And I am the only staff member here at night. And today I need to get this of my chest, and no one is here to talk to so... 

So every weekend I have to kick at least one room out (we're cheap and there is also a military base nearby, and 18-20 year old in the military are the worst). But it's rarely a big deal to me, it's usually young kids who are petrified of a stern talking to. However today.... 

Last night I was looking through the arrivals list and I flagged one room as a potential party room, local address, different name on the booking and the CC, biggest room we have etc. So when I arrived today and the girl who worked the evening shift told me they were kicked out I wasn't surprised. She said she had let the guy who booked the room stay the night but everyone else left. She went home, all was good. 

An hour and a half later six people arrive all going up to the fifth floor (the party room floor), so I go up to the fifth floor. The party is back on, there is twelve of them... and I kick them out. The guy who booked the room is FURIOUS because ""the other girl told him they could stay the night"" 

""yes, if you don't have a party"" 

""this isn't a party"" 

""what is it then?"" 

""... something else"" 

""cool, don't care, you have to go"" 

""then I want a refund"" 

""nope"" 

""I am not leaving"" 

""if you're not gone in 2 minutes I'm calling the military police"" (not an empty threat, they've given me their number)

I leave, he comes down 30 seconds later and leaves shouting some obscenities on the way out. Whatever they're gone. Expect he returns, furious. it's at this point I think ""this motherfucker is gonna punch me in the face"" so I press the panic button just in case.  He walks up to me starts yelling some more I step back because I don't want to be in 1. Covid distance and 2. punching distance, I don't say anything I just start walking away and he follows me. 

So i stop, turn around and tell him ""leave NOW!"" and keep walking, he follows me then changes his mind and leaves. 

Now, I am in two minds on whether or not to tell the GM. I wanna tell him cause I want he permanently banned, but also the GM is gonna ""yell"" at me for going up there myself and not calling our security company. Ugh, I'll probably end up telling him.",16,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0C5B2E0>

I look at my coworker on the next station, and I can only imagine what kind of “Did we just see that?” expression was on my face. 

My coworker mentioned that it was Farmer Appreciation Day. So when the “cow” came back through, I mentioned my town’s dairy festival.

473,"Blown Up, Beaten, Robbed-- The Security Shitshow Continues","Long time no see, r/TalesFromTheFrontDesk! I've made a [couple](https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheFrontDesk/comments/kfg2mq/security_has_paranoid_breakdown/) [posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheFrontDesk/comments/m9puzg/security_shitshow_finally_got_cleaned_up_paranoid/) before directly about the security issues at my property-- despite my optimistically proclaiming that the security shitshow had been ""cleaned up"" in the title of the last one, nothing of the sort happened. 2021 was a *really* bad year for me at work.

I work NA at one in a cluster of hotels located in a bad part of town. There's a lot of homelessness and theft in the area (a previous adventure I've had with the local homeless population is detailed [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheFrontDesk/comments/ibyp39/homeless_heck/)), and it's just a bad vibe in general. Because of this, we have overnight security-- but there's only one guard for 5 hotels, and the company contracted to provide our security until recently was total shit.

Company X primarily sent old retirees as security guards. One of these old men was fired for stalking/harassing a NA at another one of the hotels. Of the two non-geriatric guards I ever saw, neither had any idea what they were doing and had clearly received very little, if any, training. One of them often skipped work or slept in his car during the night. Everyone knew that our security was inadequate, but the owners refused to do anything about it until incidents occurred and forced them to.

**Blown Up**

It's the night of July 3rd/morning of July 4th and I'm working. The faint sounds of fireworks can occasionally be heard, but no one has made any complaints yet and so I haven't had to explain to some entitled idiot that I do not actually have the power to silence everyone in a two mile radius. Then, suddenly, fireworks start going off *very* close. Someone is shooting fireworks off in our parking lot, and it's not stopping. I call security and he says that he's already on his way. Great!

I wait, but fireworks are still going off. I text the security guard for an update. No answer. No one has called to complain yet, but I know that it's coming, so I head outside to see what's going on.

The security guard is parked in his golf cart about 60 feet away from a drunk ass group of kids, half-heartedly yelling at them to stop. The kids are ignoring him and laughing, saying stuff like ""just one more"", etc.. I am immediately furious that the guard is doing *basically nothing*, and yell out a ""HEY!"" to get the kids' attention as I stomp up to them, snapping at the guard to call the cops as I pass. I tell them that they need to go. Lead dumbass, who has been drunkenly fumbling around trying to find the fuse for one of those enormous 40-shot box fireworks again slurs ""Just one more!"". By now I've reached him, and pick the firework up before he can light it (he wasn't even close, so it's not like it was going to go off in my hands) and very firmly tell him ""Not one more, *now!*""

Lead dumbass and his back up idiots immediately get whiny and start demanding the firework back, promising to leave, saying that if I take it I need to pay him $80, stupid shit. I inform him that since he's already proven that his drunk ass can't be trusted to listen he can either pick up the firework in the morning or follow me back into the hotel and wait for the cops to get here and escort him off property with it, so that I know he won't be setting it off in my parking lot. Shockingly, he and his drunk friends didn't stick around to wait for the cops to show up and write them up for DUIs (they literally weren't even staying at any of the hotels, they were just assholes), so they leave. Security guard has the nerve to start scolding me afterwards, but I just roll my eyes and stomp off.

My GM comes in to relieve me and I tell her the whole story. She is pissed that I had to go out and do security's job for him, and says that she'll try (again) to get the owners to dump Company X and hire someone decent. I ask her if I should leave the firework in case one of the dumbasses comes to pick it up, but she says I can take it home. I'm super excited since I love fireworks, though my family has never been able to afford splurging on big ones like this. We usually just get some sparklers and maybe one rocket, and this year we weren't even doing that.

As the title of this section implies, the fucking thing blew up in my face as soon as I lit it. I was being super safe-- I had even looked up the model of the firework beforehand and watched videos of it going off!-- but the *instant* I lit the fuse it started to go off. I hit the deck immediately, but one of the balls hit me square in the chest, a huge hunk of my got hair burned off, and little spots on the lenses of my glasses ended up melted where sparks had landed. It could have been a lot worse, I didn't end up having to go to the ER or anything, but it fucking sucked. All I can say is that it's a good thing that I took it away from Lead Dumbass, as he was decidedly *not* being super safe. The ball that hit me in the chest probably would have gotten him in the fucking eye.

**Beaten**

Fast forward to August. The golf cart that Company X provides so that the security guards can actually get around between the 5 hotels has been broken for weeks, and the company is refusing to replace or repair it. Because of this, quick response from security is an utter crapshoot-- remember that none of these people are exactly in peak physical condition-- if they happen to be on the other side of the cluster when you call, it can take well over 30 minutes for them to get there, up to an hour if they don't feel like rushing (they usually don't).

It's a Saturday night, and while I work at an extended stay and its definitely not a ""party"" hotel, we're usually full on the weekends and consistently have people wandering in and/or out until about 3AM. I look out the window and a shirtless homeless man is sitting on the ground, straight up eating out of our trashcan. I call security, but she is about as far away as she can possibly be. The trashcan in question is about three feet away from our main door. He is extremely visible to any guests who may enter or exit the building. I don't want to leave him there for however long security will take to get there.

I usually have pepper gel on me, but I had stupidly left it in my car, so I grabbed a miniature baseball bat that we keep in the back, took a deep breath, and walked outside. I told him, calmly but firmly, that he needed to leave.

Immediately, I knew I had made a mistake. I had been hoping this guy would run off scared like most homeless people do when confronted, but instead he was *immediately* hostile, screaming profanity at me (and spitting the garbage in his mouth all over the place). I kept telling him to leave and he kept yelling, calling me fat and a bitch etc.. I knew that showing weakness by going back inside would only encourage him, and probably result in him doing something worse-- maybe even following me inside. (Have I mentioned that the front doors don't lock? There's supposedly a key somewhere, but it's not on the front desk key ring, despite my asking to be given a copy multiple times and even after all three of these incidents.)

So, I'm stuck. I stand my ground, and keep telling him to leave and threatening to call the police. He had backed away from the garbage at this point, but when he starts pushing boundaries and reaching into it again I step forward and tell him no. He screams and flails a bit, but backs off even more than before, and I feel a little relieved since I interpret this as him being all bark and no bite. When he reaches for the can again, I move my bat up onto the rim to block his hand and again tell him to leave.

Then he punches me in the face.

I think he expected this to make me run away, but it did not. I am much, much bigger than he is (he's scrawny-- visible ribs) and I push towards him to bring that size advantage to bear and start swinging the bat. I'm just trying to push him back with it rather than really hurt him, aiming for his side/stomach. He is continuing to punch me in the face. It, honestly, really doesn't even hurt. He doesn't have a lot of strength to put behind the punches. Eventually, though, he lands a hit right on the bridge of my glasses, slamming them into my nose, and that *does* hurt, as well as knock them off, so I reel back. He, thankfully, takes the chance to run off. This was all in the course of like 10 seconds.

I pick up my glasses and go back inside to call the police. Once that's taken care of, I call my manager. My manager is on vacation on the other side of the country and starts losing her goddamn mind, because there's really nothing she can do. She calls my old manager, who switched to managing one of the hotels next door, and thankfully she's able to rush over and take desk duty while I sit in the lobby crying. Security finally shows up and does nothing, clearly bewildered. My old manager assures me that she will *make sure* the owners get a better security company now. The cops take forever to show up, but it turns out that's because they spotted and arrested the homeless guy on their way to the hotel. I give my statement, they take photos of my face (no bruises other than the bridge of my nose), and pull the homeless guy out of the cruiser for me to identify (I was in between two other cruisers with their brights on and shining in his face, so he couldn't see me). People keep asking me if I want an ambulance but frankly I just want to go home, and so I refuse.

I got a week and a half paid time off after that traumatic experience, and my manager raised my pay by a dollar once I came back (out of guilt, I think). The owners also *finally* ended up dumping Company X, which would be great...except for the fact that *they didn't hire another company to replace them*.

**Robbed**

While the other two were an epic saga, this one really isn't. It was just over a month later in September. I was back at work, and had a new policy of ""if it's not happening in my lobby, I will not be dealing with it"" that I had made very clear to management. Things had been quiet, but the ""week"" without security coverage was very quickly ballooning, and to me it was obvious that the owners were trying to get away with not hiring a replacement for as long as possible.

I went to the bathroom. Usually I take my phone with me, but I just left it on the desk today. In plain view of the lobby. Some random asshole on a bike literally just walked in, took it, and walked out. I stayed at work late to make calls on the office phone and took a long weekend. The next week the owners *still* hadn't hired a new security company, but had hired an ""operations manager"" to keep an eye on things. They were basically doing the same thing they had been doing with the maintenance workers in 2020, asking an untrained normal employee to act as a security guard, but this time just hired someone for that explicitly. Whatever.

&#x200B;

**FIN**

I really don't want to work at this place anymore. I had been growing increasingly sick of this job since my old manager left-- she was an absolutely amazing boss, and responsible for a lot of the misguided loyalty on display in the first two incidents that led to my sticking my neck out. The new manager was nice, but that was about it. She wasn't half as capable or committed as the old one, and ended up leaving after less than 6 months for a recruiting job in the same company. The new new manager is fine, but I miss my old boss and am just so tired of this place and all its bullshit. We actually have a new security company now, Company Y, and while they are much, *much* better than Company X I can't say I have a ton of faith in them. I actually felt pretty good when we had both the ""operations manager"" *and* the professional security guard together, but the owners suck balls and fired him, of course.

I graduated in August, before the beating incident, but haven't had any luck finding a job in my field. I've also applied to some other jobs not in my field, just to get out of this one, but haven't had any luck there either. I suppose it would be easy for me to move to another hotel with all my NA experience, but I just...don't want to. I've decided that if anything else horrible happens to me here, though, I'm done. I'm quitting on the spot.",22,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0C5B3A0>
474,I would prefer the Violence over the Flagrant Disrespect,"I work as a night auditor at a two-star hotel in a franchise. 75% of the time it's quiet, and I get to study for school and watch movies. And may another 15% of the time I'm dealing with minor issues (Server going down, drunk people. needy guests, you know). 

Not the fuck tonight though.

I get a phone call about a noise complaint on the 2nd floor, and I let the guest know that I'm going to check it out. Sure enough, when I arrive there are about 5 people physically finding in the hallway. They are screaming and acting like idiots, but I take a breath and tell them ""Hey, please quiet down and go back to your rooms. It's one in the morning.""

Now they all nodded and said they understood, and started filing back into their rooms. However, there were still 2 girls lingering in the hallways, yelling at each other, so I was waiting for them to return to the two separate rooms.. Now, because of similar past experience, I as a rule like to wait to make sure everyone gets to their room safely. However, one of the girls in the hallway is annoyed by this.

""What the fuck you waiting for? Leave us alone. We're just talking."" I let her know that I'm waiting to make sure everyone gets back to their rooms safely. She doesn't like this. This boar proceeds to cuss me out and throw a fit. It is at this point that I am done with their bullshit. 

Maybe it seems silly to you, but with all the people that I have kicked out and dealt with shootings, stabbings, dv, and all sorts of shit; all of those psychos were very polite and cordial with me despite their manically violent personalities. However, this wild boar of a woman doesn't know how to hold her tongue, and is just screaming expletives at me.  I could've tolerated the drugged-up fights and screaming to a certain extent, but not the disrespect. It pisses me off.

Me: ""You're done. I'm going to have to ask you to leave-""

Her: ""Fuck you bitch!""

Me: ""Okay, then, I'm calling the cops.""

They were out as soon as the cops came (screaming at me as they went out the door), but the other room stayed behind: they swore they weren't a part of the fight, and it would've been a bigger issue to kick them out than let them stay at this point. I let them know if there was the least complaint they would be out the door.

476,You cannot even make this up and it's not even everything.....,"I work at an older hotel in downtown Minn. The hotel is part of the historic society and is over 100 years old.  Rustic French appeal with updated furniture, it looks super nice! The employees that I work with are amazing, the managers I work beside are second-to-none, but there's one person at this place that is single-handedly destroying the business... that person is the owner.  These things include and aren't limited to:

1. Firing security in a seedy part of downtown after multiple assaults (battery and sexual) on the property
2. Cutting hours without manager permission, firing employees without consulting us (management)
3. Having an affair with a middle-aged man while he's married to his current wife
4. Running an on-site restaurant that is grossing less than $1000 a week and using hotel funds to keep it afloat
5. Allowing multiple women to be groped weekly and calling it ""a bizarre moment that is once in a lifetime""
6. Allowing vagrants to assault employees behind the desk and on property and noting it was OUR fault they snuck in the hotel (after he fired security)
7. Is staunchly against vaccines and thinks anyone who gets them are criminals or ""idiots""
8. Forcing our GM to work 16s on a salary for 6 days a week (he put in his 2 weeks today)
9. Visiting gay bars with the company credit card and writing them off as consulting fees

477,"""He just wants a refund because it's cheaper now""","A guest calls down to the front desk to complain that he did not get stayover service and ask to have housekeeping come up and clean his room up. I apologize to him, let him know that housekeeping is gone for the day and that they are not performing stayover service unless requested because of COVID, and offer to come up and do some spot cleaning if he'd like. He declines but asks if housekeeping can come in and clean his and his coworker's rooms the next day. I tell him that we can absolutely get that set up. Normally, I wouldn't allow a guest to request stayover for another room but both rooms were initially booked in his name. His coworker calls a few minutes later to ask about why *his* room wasn't cleaned. I tell him the same thing and that his coworker had requested stayover service for both of their rooms. He thanked me and that was that. Everything *should* be fine. 

Nope.

About an hour later, while I'm eating my dinner in the back, I hear someone yelling at my coworker so I listen in a bit. It's the guys who requested stayover service. One of them is throwing a tantrum because he ""wouldn't have stayed here if \[he\] wasn't going to get his room cleaned"", ""if \[he\] didn't want housekeeping, \[he\] would have brought \[his\] wife"", and ""you'll regret this when my credit card company calls to tell you about the chargeback."" I know my coworker can handle herself but I come around and stand a bit behind her to observe and jump in if need be; I spoke with them on the phone so I can call them out if they try to lie about what I told them.

That offer still stands."" His coworkers ended up (literally!) pulling him out of the building. After they left, my coworker told me that one of the more reasonable guys had said that the angry gentleman had seen that the rates for tonight were cheaper than they were when they booked and he had been going on a tirade about wanting a refund for that reason.

478,Now THAT guy looks like FBI,"I was training a new clerk during the 7-3 when a portly old bald guy in his 60s comes in and asks for the government rate.  He's dressed like a relic from the 70's in a really tacky polyester jacket.  Normal procedure, I ask him for some government ID.

He opens his jacket to pull out his ID and at the same time very deliberately displays a huge .44 magnum hogleg in a shoulder holster.  The ID is fake.  Bad fake. I mean, you know that embossed label tape you used to put your name on stuff when you were a kid? It is basically a photo ID with ""F.B.I."" in label tape underneath it.  The hotel is far from full so I shrug and check him in at the government rate.

After he leaves...

Trainee:  Wow, was that guy really FBI?

Me:  I highly doubt it.  I have actually spoken to FBI agents in this job before, and they never look like that.  See that guy standing over there? (I point at a  young man in a dark suit who has been hanging around in the lobby for the past 20 minutes).  Now THAT is what FBI agents usually look like.

At that exact moment the same young man approaches the front desk, pulls out his very real FBI credentials and asks for information on the man who just checked in.  About an hour later the guy was led out in handcuffs.

Edit:  Some folks doubt this is real due to the convenient timing, but I swear it happened exactly as I told it above.  One of those rare events in life that unfolds like a movie.

Had a late show right before audit, not a problem, all good- I looked at my locked door, recognized him from maybe two days ago? So I immediately think, alright he's already here with us- but let's do the proper thing, make sure they're aware of the keypad that lets them open the locked door.   


I press the button on the box that intercoms my voice  
Me: ""Good evening! Do you have a reservation with us?""  
Shiny: ""Silver"" (Name changed for obvious reasons, but kept metallic for reasons)  
I already recognized him, so I let him in and smile towards him under my mask.

Me: ""Welcome back""   
He grunts and walks up to the front desk; I figure he needs TP or Towels or something.  
Me: ""How can I help you...?""  
Shiny: ""Silver""   
Me: ""Yeah! You're good to go!""  
Shiny: ""No, Silver. Reservation.""  
Me: ""Oh, you're checking in again! I thought you hadn't left us!""   
So I proceed with the check in, I already know the guy and he's super extra shiny, so whatever.  
His girlfriend, or something, doesn't speak a lick of English and goes over to the hot chocolate.   
Big uh-oh, I don't replace that for another 3 hours, and I don't know when it was last replaced.  


Shiny: ""That hot water?""  
Me: ""No clue, I don't know when it was last replaced. I don't replace it for another three hours""  
Shiny: ""Is there a microwave in the room""?  
^(Dude, you were here literally four days ago.)  
Me: ""Yea, there's water in the room.  
^(At this point, he walks over to the snack counter, I was watching his girl make an absolute mess of my coffee station when he calls over to me.)  
Shiny: ""Could I get some water?""  
Me: ""For sure, want some snacks too?""  
^(We go through this, the usual. And then he asks a weird question / said a statement)  
Shiny: ""You gotta be nice to us shiny members.""  
^(Now, I should've just said 'Yup' but at the time, and over the last three weeks I'm kinda done being walked on, so instead.)  
Me: ""Nope, I don't gotta be nice to anyone. Just give you good customer service""  
^(Shiny was taken aback, this was not the answer he was looking for.)  
Shiny: ""You don't have to be nice to anyone?""  
Me: ""Nope, if you break policy you're the same as any other criminal.""  
^(Shiny, bewildered that he wasn't the god-king)  
Shiny: ""Well best not break policy.""  
Me: ""Indeed!"" At this point, the woman was done and they began to leave.  
Shiny: ""Have a good night bud.""  
^(Idk why, but I've always hated bud, it feels demeaning.)  
Me: ""Sleep well!'",67,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0C5B640>
481,Finally getting Night locks!,"Such a silly thing for the entire staff to be excited about, but we are all ecstatic to hear we will be getting Night locks. 
Our hotel is unique in that it is built into a parking garage and we have bus service to a small city which means we have a fairly large unhoused community for the size of our town. It sucks because we have to sus out actual guests from people off the street who come in to use our bathroom. 
After months of us dealing with this and having to kick people out of our breakfast buffet, this whole situation had to escalate to our night auditor getting yelled at and having to call police as well as someone defecating on the mens room floor, forcing our housekeeping staff to wear a hazmat suit to clean it, for our owner to be like “maybe we should get Night locks”.
To be clear, we’ve been asking for them. I can’t believe it took this long.",7,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0C5B6A0>
482,Some guests just don't listen and or/can't be pleased,"In walks this senatorial dignified looking older gentleman who has a reservation. I get his ID and get the process started and I ask for a phone number. He looked at me for a moment then looked down and mumbled his phone number. I said ""I'm sorry Sir could you please repeat that?"" He then loudly and slowly enunciates each number as if I'm bothering him or something.

OK so he's one of those guests. I ask if he has any pets which is standard as people try to sneak pets in of course. He started to look around for a few moments as if he was trying to locate something and paused for a few seconds then said ""I don't see any pets following me."" I didn't bother trying to get any other info I just finished the process as fast I could and sent him on his way. 

I step outside the office to check if HSK left any linens or towels so I could fold them. I was gone for maybe 4 minutes tops and I left the sign up saying I'll be back within 5 minutes. I come back to the office and the phone rings and it's a lady asking about our ADA rooms, rates, etc. I give her all the info and she pauses for a few seconds then says ""Is your office open?""

Puzzled, as shes talking to me on our office line, I said ""Yes ..."" The she said ""I don't know but maybe you locked your front door my mom has been waiting for 

# OVER

20 minutes. Please unlock your door so she can check in. If she has to wait any longer I will call corporate"" *click*

Now I'm seriously wondering how old her mother is because the lady on the phone sounded ""old"" if you know what I mean. However her mother was barely 60 and she had not been waiting for over 20 minutes.

Mom: I need an ADA room with 2 beds please.

Me: The only ADA rooms we have at the moment are all single beds, will this work for you?

Mom: I just need an ADA room with 2 beds, ground level.

Me: I do have a ground level ADA room however it only has one bed.

The Mom is silent for a few moments then hands me her CC which I take to mean she is accepting the ground level ADA room with 1 bed. Wrong--stupid me. She comes back a few minutes later.

Mom: I said I need an ADA room with 2 beds you gave me only 1.

Me: I'm sorry Ma'am but as I explained earlier the only ADA rooms I have tonight are all single rooms. I do have rooms with 2 beds but none are ADA rooms.

The Mom starts rocking her head back and forth while jiggling her keys in her hands as if there is anything to debate.

Mom: OK since you're not going to help me I want my money back.

Me: Be glad to Ma'am.

I thought I was being clear enough but I guess not.",29,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0C5B700>
483,A supervisor that wasn't in my department tried to steal my tips,"Tales From Your Server thought that this might be better suited to being posted here.  
\_\_\_\_\_\_  


Tl;Dr I was told that all tips were  to be given to management. Didn't go along with this and was nearly  strip searched when management thought I had kept tips for myself.  
\_\_\_\_\_\_

This happened many years ago, I just thought that you might enjoy the story.

Brace yourself, this is a long one.

I  was working in European hotels for quite a while and in this particular  5-star hotel I was working as Concierge. I loved the job as I felt that  my local contacts and knowledge could enhance our guest's stay  immeasurably.

During the busy  summer season I worked all hours, even giving out my personal number to  selected groups so that they could call me at any time if they needed  any advice while in the town. I spent free time getting to know local  business owners and arranging deals for our guests to get special rates  if I were to book on their behalf. You know, just the normal concierge  stuff, really.

I had a number a  groups that I would focus my attention on at one time. I would try to  help everyone, but I did pick a few of the larger groups and really go  out of my way for them especially. The reason I did this was to get  tips. I was being paid a servant's wage and wanted to supplement it.

Quite  soon into the busy period (early June iirc) a staff meeting was called.  The Hotel Manager (Michel), Assistant Manager (Markus), Head Chef  (Luka), F&B/ Restaurant Manager (Tiffany) and Housekeeping  Supervisor (Johanna) stood at the front of the restaurant facing the  seventy or so staff members present. In my role, I reported to Markus.  He was the head of guest services. I had almost never spoken directly  with Michel and had very little to do with Johanna.

The hotel manager started the meeting.

""Me  and Johanna feel, well all of us managers, we feel it is unfair that,  if we don't all share our tips, some people are left out and they  deserve a cut...""

Johanna swiftly  stepped forward and interrupted Michel, speaking loudly and sternly to  room. ""This hotel is a machine. It's not one person that makes a guest  tip; it's every person here. What if someone will tip Celia. She's a  waitress. She can smile and serve them dinner. But what if their food  was cold? What if the tablecloth is dirty? Would they tip then? No! So,  it isn't Celia that deserves the tips at all. No, it is the chefs that  make the food and us in housekeeping that clean the linen.What if  \[AfroCrow\] is handed €100 and puts it in his pocket? What do you think  about that? That he keeps our money for himself? Is that fair to  everyone else? He only arranged for them to go on a tour or a restaurant  in town. Any old trained chimp can do that. But what about the bed they  slept on? What if the room wasn't cleaned each day? Would they tip him?  No, they would complain.""

She paused for a moment, no doubt to witness the echo of her own voice before she continued her spiel.

""You  know who keeps the lights on? You know who pays the bills, your wages,  pays suppliers and organises reservations? Us! We keep the lights on and  make sure this hotel stays open. Without us, none of you have a job.  So, start acting like it. I'm so sick of people who don't deserve it  getting all of the appreciation, while the people in here that actually  work the hardest go without! If you are tipped by a guest, then that  money isn’t yours. It belongs to all of us. You are stealing from all of  us. Any money you have received from tips, past, present and future  must be given to us so we can distribute it fairly to all staff. Anyone  who is seen keeping tips will be fired. No warning! You will be out! Do I  make myself clear?""

There was a  murmur of agreement and the management left the room. Some people turned  to each other and asked ""Who the hell was she?"", as chefs and hotel  maintenance rarely came into contact with housekeeping.

A  friend asked if I had really got €100 tip. I hadn't. I had been given  €20 by a guest the previous day to pay me back when I fronted them for a  taxi fare after they left their wallet in their room.

Of  course, I did receive tips. I would say around €100-150 per week spread  over roughly 380 rooms, but never anything as large as €100 from one  guest alone. Tipping culture just wasn't prevalent in Europe at that  time. I'm not sure if it has changed now.

A  few weeks after 'The Meeting', a family of upper class generational  wealthers came to stay. From conversations with them it appeared that  they didn't do anything. They owned a lot of assets, companies and  property, but their day to day was at their leisure. I worked around the  clock to keep up with their demands. Most were reasonable, some  unreasonable (calling me in the middle of the night to arrange to have  their sheets changed as they had sweat too much in their sleep). They  made it clear that everything wasn't to their standards but I did my  best to put out all of their fires.

At  the end of their stay, they handed me a pastel green envelope with  embossed leaf and spiralling branch patterns, containing five €50 notes.  ""You have been the only pleasurable part of this miserable experience.  Please, contact us if you come to the US, we would love to have you work  for us."" I had no intention of working for them. Ten days had been more  than enough. Nice as they were to me in conversation, I felt they  treated me like personal a butler.

After  my shift ended, I went to the management office. The door was open.  Michel, Markus and Johanna were inside, laughing at a joke I had not  heard.

""Excuse me."" I said.  
Johanna's head snapped around and she glared at me, with an expression as though my presence angered her.  
""What?"" she snapped.  
""Yes, \[AfroCrow\] what can we do for you, Markus asked, talking over her.  
""I've just been given this and I thought that we were supposed to share tips so all staff get a share.""  
I  held out the envelope for Markus to take. Before he could, Johanna  snatched it from my hand. Her eyes widened as she looked inside. She  looked at Michel for a moment. A few seconds of silence passed before  Johanna turned to me again. Quickly, her infuriated expression returned.  
""Are you still here? You can go now if there's nothing else. Go and do... whatever it is you pretend to do.""

I looked at Markus in disbelief. I was expecting him to chastise her for being so rude.  
""Who is this woman? She isn't my supervisor. She holds no authority over me and my position in the hotel."" I thought.  
I  expected Markus to stick up for me. We got on well and I at least  expected a thank you or well done for earning such a large amount in  tips in one go. Instead, I felt as though it was I that was  inappropriately intruding in the office doorway, like I imagine it would  feel to realise you were crashing a funeral.  
I looked at Johanna as she glared and back at Markus, but no support came.

A  couple of weeks later and none of the staff I spoke with had received  any share of the tips I had given up. I had gone on to receive a further  €400 in the interim, accumulated from the odd €10 here and €20 there.  With the number of staff in the hotel, we should have been given back  roughly €7 each from my haul alone. But I was not the only person who  had passed tips upwards. Many others had also given what they had been  gifted, to be distributed evenly amongst everyone.

Tiffany  and I went to the manager's office together whilst we were both off  shift. She had collected a tidy sum of money from her staff in good  faith that they would see some of it back. Tiffany said that one of the  receptionists had also been given a few small amounts from guest to pass  on to staff over the past few weeks, which she had also given to  management.

When Michel opened the Manager's Office door, he asked what we wanted.

I replied ""Over the last month, we've calculated that the staff have given you at least €1000 in tips. We wanted to know...""  
""Where's our money?!!"" Tiffany blurt out.  
""Look, I don't have time to deal with petty matters; I've a hotel to run. Johanna deals with tips. Ask her."" Michel replied.  
""When can we expect it?"" Tiffany asked.  
""Don't ask me. Talk to Johanna.""  
""Where is she?"" Tiffany replied.  
""She's not working today.""  
""Can you call her? We need to sort this out.""  
""No, I can't call her. Sort it out on your own time, not mine!"" The door slammed shut in our faces.

The  next day Johanna made a point to be loud and seen by everyone while she  went around and personally handed €3 to each staff member.  
I asked  where the rest of it was. She told me that I was misremembering how much  money I had contributed and that other staff's claims of passing on  tips were completely false.  
""There was a lot less in the pot than you  people seem to think there was. And if you lot want to bring forward  any accusations of stealing, then you better have some damn solid proof,  otherwise there will be a whole lot of people all looking for new jobs  all at the same time.""  
""I'm not giving any more tips in that case.  I'll keep what I'm given. Everything else everybody earns can be shared  amongst the rest of you, but I'm keeping mine.""  
""No, you won't. That's stealing. You don't get to decide what happens with tips. I do!""  
""Sorry, but I don't know who decided you were in charge of tips, but...""  
""Michel! The guy who runs this hotel decided. That's who!""  
""Look,  I'd just be a lot more comfortable if I kept what I'm given and if  everyone else wants to pool theirs together, that's up to them.""  
Johanna looked furious. She stormed off and yelled ""Well if I catch you, then your head will be the first to roll!""

So, dear reader, if you have made it this far, this is where things got weird.

Roughly  a week later, a family that I had been working closely with were  leaving. They had come on holiday after the grandfather had passed away  following a long and emotional battle with cancer. He had left a modest  amount of money and they had tried to do something nice as a family.  Although they had tried to make the best of it, perhaps it was a little  too soon to be trying to cheer themselves up by going abroad. I wasn't  expecting a tip. I didn't want one. I just wanted to make a painful  period feel a little brighter.

I  helped the doorman load their bags into a taxi and they bid me farewell.  The manager's office overlooked the front of the property, where the  cars drew up to collect guests. The elderly grandmother hugged me and  handed me a note on A5 notepaper ripped from a spiral notepad. I put it  in my inside suit jacket pocket and promised to read it as soon as they  left. It was one of the most emotional goodbyes I have had with a group  of guests.

They got into the taxi,  I waved and turned to see Johanna scowling at me through the Manager's  Office window. As I stepped back inside the hotel she flew out from the  office and demanded that I hand over money. She held her hand out, her  face red with anger.  
""It was just a letter. There wasn't any money.""  
""LIAR!""  she shouted, so loud that guests around the lobby all turned to see  what was going on. ""I just saw you! I just saw them give it to you. That  money isn't yours. It's for all of us!""

I  looked around and saw that everyone, guests, the receptionists, and  especially myself were feeling very uncomfortable. I couldn't believe  what was happening.  
""Give me the money!"" She yelled.  
""I told you, it was just a letter.""

I  took the note paper out of my pocket and she tried to snatch it from  me. I didn't expect that she would do that and was holding too tight to  let it slip. The letter ripped diagonally in two. She peered down and  what she was holding, dropped it on the floor and launched herself at  me, gripping my shirt in her fist and clambering to reach inside my suit  jacket pocket to check for money. ""Take off your jacket! I'm going to  search you to find where that money is! You've hidden it. Let me check  your pockets. Now!""

I stepped back  and pushed her away. One of the doormen ran over, held her and dragged  her away to the manager's office. As he did so, she held onto my lapel  for a second, tugging me forward before letting go and submitting to the  doorman. She was furious. I was in shock. I picked up the other half of  the letter off of the floor and tucked both pieces into my pocket. I  looked around. The lobby was silent. I felt the heat from my cheeks as I  blushed with embarrassment from the stares of several dozen people.

""Are you ok?"" One of the receptionists asked.  
""That was wild! What the hell happened?"" said another.  
""She thought I was keeping tips for myself."" I replied.  
""Is that it? What the...? That's no excuse to act like that. She's deranged!""

Now,  I usually feel I am quite stoic at work, but in that moment I felt a  lot of emotions all at once and none of them were calmness and  even-tempered. I smoothed out my suit and went to the staff toilet,  feeling angry, embarrassed, lost, self-pity, and tearful all at once. I  had been ok until the receptionist asked me how I was, then I suddenly  wasn't.

I washed my face with cold  water and started to calm myself down. I wanted to confront and yell at  her. I knew that wasn't the right way to approach it and thought to  distract myself by reading the letter.

I  pulled out the two crinkled pieces of notepaper and held them together  so I could read it. It was a heartfelt thank you from the family. The  one line that stuck with me was that they wished I could have met the  grandfather as he would have apparently really liked me. I felt a wave  of emotion so sat down and focused on remaining calm and feeling better.

After  five minutes I went to see Markus, who was in the kitchen, meeting with  the Luka. I asked him for a moment of his time and told him about the  incident. I said that I was owed an apology and wanted to see her fired  for assault. He told me to leave it with him.

When  I chased him up about it the following day, he said that it was all  just a storm in a teacup, I was overreacting, and not to worry as I  wouldn't have to talk to her again. He said if it meant that much to me,  I could keep the money. I said that it wasn't about the money that I  hadn't even been given; it was the fact she had lost control and got  physical.

He replied that we were  too busy and short staffed to lose a key manager like her. I argued that  she shouldn't get away with what she did.  
""Look mate, you're not  actually going to push me on this are you? You're not going to try and  make a big thing of it? 'Cos you know, it's not going to end well for  you if you do.""  
""What do you mean by that?"" I asked.  
""C'mon mate, don't act coy. You've been in this game long enough. You know.""

I  had no clue. Johanna was cosy with Michel and Markus, but I didn't  believe that either were cheating on their spouses with her. Why would  they try to downplay what should be quite a simple matter of firing a  loose cannon?  
14 years on and I still don't really know why she held  dominance in the power dynamic. I was the victim and apparently also the  antagonist.

In the years since, I  have worked in several high pressure management positions myself. I  know that it can be extremely frustrating when you try to inact rules  and people go against you. But that's no reason to lose control and lay  hands on a person in anger. There really is no reason to do that at all.

I  worked until the end of August when I left for another job in another  part of Europe. I never spoke to Johanna again after the incident. When I  saw her, she would scowl at me, but other than that I had very little  interaction with her. Behind my back she would spread rumours about me  and the atmosphere never felt the same again.

I  kept all of my tips from then on. Not that they amounted to a small  fortune or were anything other than a little bit of pocket money. I  didn't keep in touch with anyone from that hotel either and never found  out what happened any of them.

I'm  sorry that I can't wrap this rather anti-climactic ending up in a bow  and say that everything turned out fine. I left a job I enjoyed because a  person that felt they needed to be tipped for changing bedsheets had  assaulted me. Not much more to it than that.",13,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0C5B760>
484,"""If you wanna be rich, you've got to be a bitch.""","About a week ago at the casino resort I work at, a guest (let's call her ""RB"" for Rich Bitch) comes up to the front desk to complain about a legitimate issue with the room: a mildew odor. So I called the back office to see what kind of room move we could accommodate. During the call, RB mentioned she was guaranteed a two-queen room in our new wing (she was assigned a King there based on availability, and was informed of this upon check-in; nearly all comp reservations are first come, first serve, with no guarantees on any specific room type/location), so I relayed that to the supervisor on the phone. They let me know the only two-queen rooms available in the entire hotel were in our original wing. After the phone call ended, I made my offer to RB:



OP: It looks like we'll be able to change rooms for you. The only two-queen rooms in the entire hotel are going to be in our original tower. Would that be okay?


RB: No, it wouldn't. I specifically asked for the new wing, as I got bedbug bites from the last time I was over there. Do you want me to show you pictures?


OP: That wouldn't be necessary, ma'am. We don't have any two-queens in our new wing available for your stay.


RB: But I saw the housekeeper finish cleaning some queen rooms! Can't you just give me one of those?


OP: Those rooms have been blocked for other guests coming in today.


RB: But I **hate** the old section! My host booked me a two-queen in the new wing, so why am I not getting that? Do you want me to advertise how bad the old section is?


OP: That's because all comp reservations are first come, first serve, with no guarantees for anything specific. If you'd like to stay in the new section, we wouldn't have any other rooms to move you to, as we're sold out for the holiday weekend, not to mention the blackjack tournament and (two major sports events in town). We can also send Housekeeping up to spray the room for you.


RB: My husband is in that tournament. Besides, no amount of spray will eliminate the smell! Do you know how much money we spend here?  My host was supposed to arrange for a limo to pick us up at the airport, but it never came, so we had to take an Uber here. And now you don't have the room my host booked? I want to talk to your manager!


I then proceed to call the back office again to request a manager for RB, only to find out RB had to run off to lunch with her husband. We decided to send Housekeeping up to spray the room anyway, and I haven't heard anything from that room for the rest of the shift. I swear, it's the people who spend the most money here who are the biggest jerks!",40,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0C5B7C0>
485,The Ghost of Construction Past,"I am here to tell the tale of an ongoing mystery I am dealing with... 

The property I work at is currently under construction, and so our third and fourth floors are closed due to them being completely gutted. We do have our second floor open, and we're (luckily) selling out of the rooms that we DO have available regularly, so there's always people staying on that floor. 

Twice in the last week, I have had someone complain that there was someone doing work, sawing, jackhammering, whatever, above them at 3:30 AM. Obviously, we do not have anyone in doing work at that time, because we are not maniacs. Yet, when I tell these guests that, they insist that there definitely was someone doing work. Now, I know there isn't, because when they call down about noise up there procedure says that our NA goes to check it out, which I know that they do. They never see anyone, or hear anything. Today, I got another complaint, so I checked the cameras. Again, NOTHING. The only person I see up there is my NA when he went to check on last night's complaint. I do not understand what could possibly be making noise that is waking guests up. 

I am starting to think that we have a ghost or something. If so, he's definitely not paying his bill.",16,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0C5B820>

She said she figured it was something like that that’s why called right away. So I told her to get back on the phone and tell her that her direct supervisor told her to tell him that if he was truly the owner he would understand that he needed to contact her boss and have them tell her to do these things. To which he said okay I do understand who is your boss. She replied you should clearly know that if you own the property. He hung up.

487,I am done,"Rant ahead
I am done, I no longer like this industry or the company I work for.

Last month my maintenance man missed a day of work which was not like him at all, voice-mail and texts were left. Since I am covering the overnights I was going to go home get some sleep and connect with him the next day. 

When he did not come in I was even more worried. This man texted damn near everyday to tell me good morning boss, only missing a few days.

When I was about to call his emergency contact I got a call from his sister, he had passed away. I am still in shock from this, and spent the rest of the day crying in my office. I let my boss know about this and he offered a few words of condolence the day it happend then that was that. Radio silence from the rest of our ownership team and HR.

Oh wait HR did reach out because I was now in charge of figuring out his life insurance?! 

I am so disappointed in a ownership team that trys to sell itself as a family company with family values but if you are a line level employee who cares, just hire someone else.
I have had 3 days ""off"" since July, I work 12-16 hour days making sure my staff are taken care of, only 1 other manager on my team, covering all shifts, hiring, training, doing breakfast everything I can to make sure this hotel is above getting by and I have had no problem with this until last month when we lost an amazing human and this company could have cared less.

Of course the owner of the company can call to rip me a new one when one of my temp housekeepers has .3 hours of overtime, when they are the only housekeeper I have.
But God forbide they pick up the phone to reach out when we lose one of our own.

I am disgusted.

I am done. Done with my team who would not help out with coverage so we could attend the funeral 4 hours away. Done with guests who make snarky comments about the most bullshit tiny problems with there room needing maintenance. Done with an ownership team who could give a single f*** about anyone.
 
DONE DONE DONE DONE DONE.

her: ""Well, we don't know yet.  We want to be able to arrive at the hotel in the morning, drop off our dog and go skiing all day.""

me: ""First of all, if you have a pet, someone must be present with the animal in the room at all times.  Leaving the animal unattended is against policy.  Now, if you could narrow down the dates, I may be able to h---""

her: ""No, that's not going to work.  How about your competition?  Will they take care of our dog?""

me: ""Ma'am, I can not speak for other properties, but I think it is a fairly universal requirement that animals not be left unattended.""

her: ""Well, what am I supposed to do then?""

me: ""You may want to look into kennels, or animal boarding shelters.""

her: ""No, I don't want a Kennel!  I want somewhere where I can show up, drop off my dog, go out and have a good time and not have to worry about him until we return later in the night!""

me:  ""What you just described is the textbook definition of a Kennel.""

489,Work/life balance…and non-adulting guests,"I am the manager of the cheapest hotel in town. I have an extremely small staff. A girl that does housekeeping in the am Monday through Thursday and also desk in the evening same days, a housekeeper on Saturdays and Sundays, and a front desk lady that works Friday evenings, stays in the hotel with the phone Friday nights and every other Saturday night, and works a 12 on Saturdays and every other Sunday (for me to have time off). 
All the rest of it is me, including the overnights. 

It was worse when we opened in April and it was ONLY ME until late June. 

We have 57 rooms. 

We are trying to cater to extended stays, but without kitchenettes. And actually the majority of our occupancy is extended stay. But being the cheapest hotel in town, we get a lot of people who have sob stories. And being such a small staff, it is getting overwhelming listening to all of these needy and helpless (and lonely) guests. 

It is really running me down!  It is not physically hard, but it is so emotionally draining. 

And being the live in manager, even when I am “off” I am still submerged, or feel like these people are in my business or know my comings and going’s. I even had a guest ask me if he could borrow my dogs. 

I am really trying to look at the bright side of living where I work (with my very awesome and supportive family, husband, and 3 teenagers). We are very close knit but I feel like my job is sucking so much life out of me that I don’t have the best parts of myself to give to my family. 

And on top of that, being the cheapest, we get so much transient activity, this is the first place homeless stop, or cops bring someone. I was at a hotel manager meeting today addressing the issue of homelessness and even the community action lady is so overwhelmed and burnt out. She said it is so hard to find who has a legitimate desperate need and who is a system gamer. Here I am struggling between running a business and having a heart, but any kindness offered suddenly turns into an entitled expectation. 

Financial times are hard for everyone, and the bright side is this job does provide that secure roof over my own family’s head. My youngest teenager has health issues that are requiring a lot of dr visits and my husband is laid off and I am so grateful for him being able to be dad and even more so, support for me because without his strength I could not do this job. I just need a way to find a better work/life balance and a way to escape the needy (but not my job to fix their needs) guests.",13,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0C5B9A0>
490,It must suck to be angry about literally everything,"So I just checked this guy in and everything was an inconvenience to him.

The fact that this is a lobby but it doesn't look traditional.

The fact that we are CLEARLY an exterior facing property.

The fact that he has to text us to request towels.

The fact that we are staffed 24/7, we just don't have overnight sitting in the lobby all night and they are accessible through text.

The fact that our ***FREE*** popsicles you aren't ***required*** to take have sugar.

He's gonna have a horrible stay/life.

Whelp he came back and was PISSED that I was helping the guests that were already in my lobby, only to become even more irate that our restaurant closes at 8 pm, that we do not have coffee drinks or sugar free energy drinks in the lobby and that he's ""stuck here with no food or drink"" because *he* didn't rent a car, so that's obviously my fault considering I've worked here for a month and a half as a standard agent, begging for at least soft drinks to sell since I started.

Oh, and he said this is a ""stupid fucking place"" as he left my lobby upon his ***THIRD*** visit to see me because we don't have freezers in the room for the popsicles he didn't even fucking want anyway.",55,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0C5BA00>
491,"That is not how loyalty programs work, sir...","Oh boy! It's winter! Thankfully, since I live in a summer tourism area, winters are very slow at my property. Almost all the people I have in house are hotel employees staying due to inclement weather and I am vibing.

Due to this, we don't have a PBX tonight. Fair enough, I can handle the average of 1 call per hour as I sit doing nothing. Because of this, though, I got to have a rather... strange conversation. The players tonight are myself and Cheapskate Charlie.

Me: This is the front desk, Blackheart speaking. How can I help you?

Charlie: I need to see if you have 2 rooms for Friday night.

Me: Absolutely! Are you a rewards member, a AAA member, or AARP member?

Charlie: No... Does that change anything?

Me: Well, it will effect the price a little, but it doesn't change availability or anything like that, sir!

Charlie: Well, no, I'm not a member.

Me: Okay, well then--

Charlie: Are you a member? Can I use your account?

Me: (as dry as desert air) No, sir.

Charlie: You're not a member?

Me: No, I am a member. But, you cannot use *my* account for a reservation, sir. It doesn't work like that.

Charlie: (sounds almost offended that I won't let him do this) Well, damn, okay then!

Me: I'm sorry, sir.

Charlie: You're not sorry. I can tell.

Of course, the price I quoted him was too high because he found a lower price online. When I told him that he would have to book online in order to get that price, he was absolutely shocked to learn that he would, in fact, have to make his own reservation on his own phone if he wanted that particular price (we don't price match at my property).

A part of me thinks it might have been a weird prank and I should have just hung up after he asked to use my rewards number, but he seemed pretty serious about the whole thing. Winter weather sure does bring out the weirdos. Stay warm, folks.",22,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0C5BA60>
492,This guy asked for a refund on his free breakfast,"I run the breakfast buffet for a popular hotel chain everyday from 5am-10am (we open at 6am). It's Thanksgiving morning and we are absolutely packed. 87 rooms and over 200 guests coming down. The area is flooded with people and I was stressing out just trying to keep up because when something runs out, they come up to me one by one ""did you know this was out?"" It was crazy and we didn't expect it to be so busy. According to o my coworkers who have been doing this for a long time. One 6 years. The other 15 years. They've been saying for the past 2 months it's always slow on Thanksgiving so not to worry and not to make a lot of extra food.

Throughout the morning, we repeatedly ran out of hot food but always had it out within 10mins. Nobody complained and everyone was in a good mood because it was a holiday.

Well, almost everyone.

Very often, there are people who will wait til the last minute to come down. They'll show up minutes before closing and make us stay open longer so they can finish setting up their plate. And that's exactly what this guy did. He came down 10mins before closing. We had plenty of hot food at the time. Which he filled a whole plate of. Then walked over to the waffle maker. 

My coworkers and I have a rule. If the waffle batter runs out less than 30mins before closing, we don't make more because we have to trash it when cleaning up and it'll just be a waste. 

He went up to my coworker and I and rudely said ""where are the waffles?"" We nicely explained to him that we ran out of batter and will not be making more.
He responds ""so you can't make me a waffle?""
We said ""no, we apologize. But if you're going to be here tomorrow, we advise you come down earlier because sometimes it's first come first serve.
Suddenly he's calm in and says ""ok, I understand"" but as he walks away he says under his breath ""Lazy bitches can't make me a fucking waffle? Bullshit.""

Note: we don't even make them for the guests. We make batter for them make on our waffle irons.

We finally get to close and we're exhausted from having to deal with so many people. Not long after, the front desk supervisor comes into the kitchen.

""Hey Ash, can I talk to you?""
""Sure, what up?"" I ask 

She says ""This guy just complained about you guys because you refused to make him a waffle?""

I said ""yes"" and explained the situation. She starts laughing and says ""This idiot literally demanded a refund.""

I asked ""For his room?"" 
She said ""no. For his breakfast""

I'm laughing ""But the breakfast is free. What did you say?""

She responds ""I told him his complimentary breakfast was refunded to his card.""

It's months later and I still love to tell people about this guy.",38,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0C5BAC0>
493,A banable offense.,"So, we have a recurring guest who EVERY DAY asks for three towels, two washcloths, and like the rolls of toilet paper.
Let's call her kb(klepto bitch).
Kb comes down to the desk on one of my morning shifts and asks for the usual, I tell her that we're almost out of towels because the hotel is at capacity. She does not take this well. She stays yelling at me and the housekeeping staff(who can't understand her because they don't speak English).
She demands towels. I say, ""we've given you like twenty towels.""
Kb  checked out today and the housekeepers go up there to find the toilet and bathtub FULL OF SHIT COVERED TOWELS AND USED TOILET PAPER. Fortunately all of the feces are in the toilet.
Anyway, the housekeepers tell me this, so after she checked out, I applied a cleaning fee.
I await the moment when she realizes this and calls us.

Also, she had me print out TWELVE COPIES OF HER RECEIPT to give to her work and have the room compensated.

494,Thank you Redditors for saving me a nonrefundable deposit!,"Booked a pre-pay hotel last night for a Thursday - Saturday stay. Saw that I was already inside the cancelation window, but knew there was no way I would cancel the appointment that required the 2-night stay.

This morning I get a call from the clinic that due to incoming inclement weather, they are canceling all Friday appointments.... I reschedule the appointment for Monday and brace myself to tell my husband I have to book ANOTHER hotel stay, but can't cancel the existing reservation.

Luckily, I follow TFTFD, so I knew to do the following things right:
1. I booked direct through the hotel's website, not through a TPA.
2. I called the front desk, told him very nicely that I was hoping he could fix a situation I created for myself.
3. Admitted that I knew I was inside the cancelation window when I made the reservation.
4. Was honest about why I needed to change my non-cancelable reservation.
5. Threw myself on his mercy.

Thanks to this subreddit and the wonderful Rico, my unusable reservation has been canceled with no penalty!",102,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0C5BB80>
495,A Call To The Cops,"When I worked at a hotel in my area a few months ago in the summer, I had this situation happen where I had to call the cops. I’ve never called the cops before in my life and it was anxiety inducing…

Basically, during the evening hours of my shift, I received a call from a male guest in room 304. He complains to me that the heater for water in his room is not working so he cannot take a hot shower. I apologize to him for the inconvenience and he requests I come take a look at it. Mind you, at this hotel I was the only staff member on property my entire shift and maintenance only came if there was an actual issue that only my manager reported. So, I obliged and made my way to his room to find that indeed his water was not turning hot no matter what I tried. Same with his sink in both the kitchenette and the bathroom. 

I again apologized for the inconvenience and told him unfortunately maintenance is not on property and probably won’t be until the next day or the day after. I called my manager after the guest was not happy with my statement, and my manager didn’t help the situation at all. Told me that we didn’t have any vacant rooms for the guests to be moved into (which we did but they were reserved) and that the guests would either have to deal with the issue until he could get maintenance or leave the property to find another hotel somewhere else.

Of course the guest and his family was not happy with my managements response and I had left their room to handle the situation at the front desk on the front desk phone. I tried my best to see if there was anyway I could work around switching their room so that the guy and his kids could get a hot shower and go to bed, but my manager wasn’t doing anything to make it better. He even told them that they wouldn’t get a refund if they went somewhere else because he would treat it as a cancellation and charge them our cancellation fee of half of the price of their stay.
Guy got on the phone with my manager and they began arguing back and forth over the whole situation, manager insults guests numerous times and makes the situation even worse. 

By now the guys wife is screaming at me, begging me to switch their room which I repeatedly say I cannot do, she tells me she just wants a shower and she’ll clean up after her and the kids after but I kept telling her we cannot make sure of that. All four of us, manager included, are having a screaming fit with one another and then eventually my manager hangs up and texts me to go somewhere else so we can talk on the phone privately.

Manager calls me and he says since the guests are being so unruly that I should call the non emergency number and have them removed forcefully by the cops. I have to oblige so I do so but cops show up about three hours later and the guests have packed up their things and left after I told them my manager made me call the cops on them. That was such a horrific night that I won’t forget. My manager just made the whole situation worse and could’ve handled the situation so much better than he did and he definitely shouldn’t have insulted the guests like he did by calling them stupid and a lot of other things.",21,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0C5BBE0>

Jagoff: Excuse me, but can you tell me if my girlfriend Trish (made up name) has checked in?

Me: I'm sorry, but I can't verify that for security and privacy reasons.

Jagoff: You can't tell me if she's here? I'm her boyfriend. Her name is Trish, she's pregnant and I'm worried.

Me: Are you able to call her on the phone?

Jagoff: I tried, but she isn't answering. I brought money to pay for a night on her room, can you just tell me if she checked in already?

Me: I'm sorry, but no I can't do that, as I said for security reasons.

Jagoff: But, she's pregnant! By me! I'm worried about her!

Me: Again, I can't tell you if she's here or not, but what I can do is after you leave, if we have anyone by that name here I can give them a call and ask them to contact you. Or you can contact our local police if you think there's a safety concern with her and they can perform a welfare check if needed.

Bro, I don't know you. I don't know why you're freaking out trying to get in touch with your pregnant girlfriend. Surely if you're in a relationship and she wants you to help pay for her room, she'd tell you where she is and in what room?

497,Man arrested because he couldn't afford a room,"I work at a hotel located in an airport. Our rooms are expensive because of the location. This one kinda made me mad. 

Airport police bring a man into the lobby for a room. He's as drunk as can be. My manager was helping on the desk and she happened to get him. She takes his id and credit card, and proceeds to register him. The card declines. We are selling for close to $300/night. He had cash and a card, but his card wouldn't go through even after applying the cash. It's possible his bank blocked the transaction since they didn't know he would be traveling, and he wasn't local. 

Now I understand why the police brought him. He was denied boarding his flight because of how intoxicated he was, and I didn't see how he was acting at the gate. There is likely a very good reason he was arrested, but almost every single time  they bring one of the drunks over to us they try to dispute the credit card charge because they would never spend that much on a room when sober. We know they are consenting to the charge of the credit card under duress because it's either pay for the room or go to jail. The hotel is corporate managed, but owned by the airport authority so I feel like there is a conflict of interest there.",138,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0C5BCA0>

The organizer of the reunion called a few times a week, every week,  for 7 months. I knew I had to not be at the desk when this woman checked in. My last day was 3 days before she arrived. 

Last night in my dreams I was back at that hotel, luckily that woman wasn’t there.  Maybe I’ve been reading too many antiwork posts but in my dream I went in to get my check and no one was at the desk.

499,Shorts from a Tuesday,"First Tale:

Come in to a Guest Assistance ticket e-mail notification.

I had received a text from one of our FDA's yesterday about if they could check in a guest who did not know their PIN. Now, our EMV reader requires a PIN if your card has one, and I have never seen it ask for one if your card doesn't.

That being said, it does not have a realistic way to bypass it. We CAN key in a card, but that's a no. And if the card has a PIN, it will ask for it, or let you hit cancel and try a different card.

I do KNOW there are other ways to get past that, but that is bypassing the security on a card IMO. The few times the guest has not known their PIN, it's been a 5 minute call to the number on the back of the card, and suddenly they changed their PIN and it works, or they 'guessed it' in one or two tries.

This guest decided instead of calling his bank, he was going to call Guest Assistance. Well, as it was after my time to be home, and the FDA was not going to check him in without his PIN, he ended up somewhere else.

I closed the GA case stating we would not be bypassing card security for a guest.

TL:DR - Guest doesn't know PIN, stays elsewhere after attempting to get FDA circumvent card security.

Second Tale:

GroupOff e-mailed me today.

They are requesting a refund for a guest, because they were sick an unable to make their reservation.

I'm trying to figure out how someone made a reservation with us through GroupOff, and go to their website, searching for my property. Nothing comes up.

I re-read the e-mail, only to see this was a reservation from 2018.

I inform GroupOff that they are outside their cancelation window, and will not be receiving a refund from 3 years ago.

PS - I don't know if it's just my property, but GroupOff was a horrible arrangement. Guests would book wrong all the time, and there was basically no customer service to them. it's like an OTA, only no one is trained on how hotels work, and no one has access to anything extranet wise to fix anything.

TL:DL - No, you cannot have a refund from 3 years ago. F right off with that.

And it's been only 3 hours!",18,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147D0C5BD60>

I work in a hotel across from a major hospital so a lot of our guests come from the country to stay with us for hospital visits/procedures. This older couple checked in early in the afternoon and we had a nice chat. Later in the evening, the gentleman comes down to chat some more and I ask him general questions about what they do and all that jazz. He lets me know they rescue wildlife so I went absolutely ham asking all questions because that is my dream! I ask him if they have someone to look after them while they’re visiting the hospital and the man sort of goes quiet..
“Actually…… we snuck in two baby wallabies and they’re sleeping in tote bags in the room” 
He asked me to please not tell management, they brought them because they need to be fed every 4 hours and they had no one to care for them while they were visiting. 
Anyway I ain’t no snitch, and the guests invited me up to their room when I finished to hold the baby wallabies which I did.
Spent 20 minutes after work in the guests room playing with and holding baby wallabies.

502,Guest causes my brain to stop and me to have a shocked Piikachu moment,"Trigger warnings: child abuse and r\*pe (mentioned only)

Mods: I am aware of the rule regarding no politics and, while this post does mention 2 presidents by name, it does so to recount their mentioning in a conversation that was not about politics. However, if that still violates the rule, I understand.

&#x200B;

So, tonight I had a conversation that led to my brain just .... stopping. For a couple seconds, it just completely refused to process anything. Even now, I still have trouble processing it; have trouble believing that someone would say. And not only say it, not only believe it, but see nothing wrong with it.

So, for the cast of characters for tonight's interaction, we have me (Me), the night audit, and the guest (Guest), who is checking in.

Our scene begins with me, at the front desk, spotting a gentleman walking in to check in.

Me: Good evening, sir. How may I help you?

Guest: Wow, you look really young. I thought you were a kid when I was walking in.

Me: *Not even sure why he felt the need to say that, but okay.* Good evening, sir. How may I help you?

Guest: I have \[the virus\]

Me: *Not really sure I heard the guest correctly and, hoping I didn't, I just stare at him.*

Guest: You must think I'm some crazy person, coming in here and saying I have \[the virus\]. I don't have \[the virus\].

Me: *Wondering why people think stupidity like this might be funny and how they haven't been removed from the gene pool by Darwinism yet.* How may I help you, sir?

Guest: I'm here to check in.

Me: \[standard spiel to get the items and information I need to begin checking him in\]

Guest: So, how is the \[virus\] situation in this state?

Me: *This is not an unusual question, and I often get it from out-of-state travelers.* \[I explain the current situation, including the rough percentage of vaccinated people as well as the rough percentage of current active cases.\]

What follows is what I thought was an actual genuine discussion regarding \[the virus\] and the vaccine. He asks some questions about my opinions and I provide answers, which he responds to with his own opinions. He throws out some misinformation, which I point out and talk about why that is misinformation. All the while, I am checking him in. I have finished checking him in, printed his receipt, made his keys, and directed him to his room when he says something about Biden's vaccine push (I don't remember exactly what).

Me: Actually, I'm quite happy with how much he's pushing the vaccine, as getting everyone who can be vaccinated vaccinated, as that's the only way we are going to get a real handle on \[the virus\]. That's one of the reasons I voted for him.

Guest: So, you aren't concerned about his cognitive deficits? Or do you just believe they aren't there.

Me: While I certainly think that any cognitive deficits that he may have are important, I do think he was a better alternative to someone who encouraged a treasonous riot.

Guest: *With such force and conviction that I could tell he truly meant it* I wouldn't care if Trump r\*ped a baby on the street on TV as long as he kept the economy growing like he was.

Reader, this is where my brain stopped. It just stopped. I know I had shocked Pikachu face. I had no idea how to process that statement. Until, suddenly, I did. Thankfully, my brain's reboot only took about 2 seconds.

Me: And that tells me everything I need to know about you. Have a good night, sir.

As he already had his keys, receipt, and knew how to get to his room, I was now in NO mood to continue what had, until that comment, been a good conversation - even if we had disagreed on some things. I would like to point out for clarification at this point that it was NOT his support of Trump that I objected to, even with my stated support of Biden; that had nothing to do with my reaction. No. It was everything else in the sentence.

Guest: *Clearly taken aback by my immediate dismissal of him (though I can't, for the life of me, imagine why he thought I - or anyone - would be ok with what he said.)* I can tell you are an educated -

Me: *refusing to look at him and staring down at my computer screen* Have a good evening, sir.

He continues to attempt to re-engage me in the conversation at least 3 more times, but each time I refuse to look at him and simply repeat ""Have a good evening, sir"" to him. He finally clues in, wishes me a good evening, and walks away to his room.

To say that I was shocked would be an understatement. The fact the he'd said it so flippantly, as though he were discussing what he was going to watch on TV, left me truly speechless. The fact that he would be so dismissive of an incredibly violent and traumatic act being perpetrated against one of the most vulnerable among us, so long as he was doing well economically, left me feeling heartbroken, not just because he said it but also because I know he's not the only one who would be so dismissive of such an act. Even now, writing this 6.5 hours later, I am having trouble processing what he said, and the certainty, the conviction, with which he said it.",59,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CC969220>
503,Prank callers can get so personal if you derail them,"Got a prank call tonight. Not an automated one that reads a prerecorded transcript or anything but a live person. Usually when a live one calls in I can generally tell how young they and I can cut them off or they hang up when I don't enable them. This one was definitely someone much older. How much though, i'm not sure? This one tried to prank ""a suicide attempt that was happening."" Something about the tone of the guy on the phone and the lack of information clued me in quick.

* Caller: There a young man here in this room saying he's going to kill himself. I don't know how he got a gun in here.
* Clerk: Have you called the cops? They are better trained to handle dangerous situations like this.
* Caller: You've got to do something. \*mumbles something about it being my job\*
* Clerk: Ok, what room is he in?
* Caller: \*mumbles something\* I don't know but you better hurry! 
* Clerk: Ok, I'm a little confused? What hotel are you at?
* Caller: This'n
* Clerk: Can you tell me the name of the hotel you're at, sir?

\*Click\* I was done after that. Now I get to sit here at my desk for x amount of time on shift thinking about how ducks feel anytime they spend too much time in the pond on a cold morning during migration season.

504,But this is a Blah Blah Hotel and I'm a Silver member,"So here is the deal over the past several years I've worked off and on at a hotel with a very long history and 30 different brands under its a umbrella. 

A few years back they updated the rewards program to stretch across all the brands so it won't matter where you were you got your points, gifts, etc, etc when they switched over the rewards program some genius in marketing made up a bastardized English word out of 2 French words BON VOYage.  (At this point you can guess where I work)

This meathead comes into the hotel for the Thanksgiving holiday. Immediately during the check-in process, he spouts off that he's a Silver member and that he and his family are and I quote ""BOUGIE and from Florida "" all the while interrupting the front desk person asking where is the most expensive place to eat, Expensive stores, and so on. Luckily the GM was watching this the entire time.

During that day of check-in, we were having the water system down for repairs EARLIER in the day. So even though the hotel did have hot water is must not have been enough or got enough for this bougie Floridian meathead.

The next day Mr. Meathead comes down and yours truly was on the front desk. And begins his tirade on me

Why are your bathrooms so small (ill give it to him on this on or bathrooms are a bit on the smaller side and he was a big and tall guy)

How come the breakfast doesn't have many healthy options. (Because of covid we didn't have a cook so the only stuff we were offering were breakfast sandwiches, oatmeal, yogurt, fruit, pastries, and coffee) This then turns onto our little snack market that has exactly that SNACKS!

Mr. Meat head goes on to ask why a BON VOYage hotel doesn't offer up more things. How a BON VOYage hotel doesn't have larger rooms. (Dude was staying in our largest room.) During all this, I knew that it didn't matter what I say I'll be in the wrong either way. So as a Vet I went into my thousand-yard stare. Luckily I had 2 other employees at the front desk to see this escapade. 

He proceeds to go into Kevin mode asking for my boss's cellphone on a holiday weekend. I inform him I'm not allowed to give our personal information and the would-be back on Monday. Now our Mr. Kevin Meathead even turns to my coworker and gives him the look for approval like ""hey fellow white man can you please agree with me even though I'm acting like a total twatwaffle""

 Said coworker didn't!

He starts demanding free nights and other amenities that we don't have. Again I told him I can take his info and inform my boss. And give him their information.

After Mr. Kevin Meathead storms off with his obvious mail-order bride. That's when I get to work.

Here are some deets on Mr. Kevin Meathead

1. Yes he does live in Florida as some type of broker but when he gets a bad review he opens a new social media page and doesn't know how to get rid of the last one.

2. Dude booked thru a 3rd party meaning he CAN'T get his points NOR can we refund him. He would have to go thru X website or the like lol

3. THE MEMBERSHIP wasn't even in HIS name it was in his wives! 

4. He didn't understand the difference between the brand of the hotel and the frequent stay membership package.

5. As a silver member he thought he was hot shit. Dude you were one step-up from basic member and about 100 stays away from being a top-tier member that we would actually care about.

Later that week he did reach out to my boss and wow did we have fun reading his supposed well-written and threatening emails. That he had to tag his daddy and wifey in to show off his LDE.

We escalated it to corporate and put him on our banned list

Also, he threatened to smear us all over social media. This is the same guy who has several businesses on Facebook but can't delete his bad reviews LOL

He posted one google review and we already flagged it.",35,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF02D130>
505,Making an ass of myself,"So we are currently hosting a few cast members of a film being shot locally, kinda more C-D list names with one B-C I'd say. Not to say too much but the B-C was a mom of ""the mouse"" in the 2000s for a couple of shows/movies.

Our location makes popsicles on site and gives 2 of them to guests complimentary per stay, and she grabbed one of hers while checking out. I can hold my cool with celebs, so I didn't fan girl or even directly mention I know who she is or her work, but when she asked what my favorite popsicle was I told her the Dole Whip, but I'm sure she has -magic mouse brand- trauma and y'all she looked at me like I was straight up DUMB.

She ended up getting the fudge bar.

Oh, I also took the gift from her production company to the wrong room. I took it to 2XX not 1XX. We did recover the gifts and get them to her though, but bruh if I had knownnnnnn",18,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF02DD00>
506,hotel ghost stories?,"hey guys! i'm wondering if any of you have any good hotel ghost stories. I know I have a few. The first hotel I worked at in Orlando, a lady killed herself in one of the rooms on the 6th floor about 5 years ago, and another older woman died of cancer the year the hotel opened (2014 i think?). our engineer found the woman who killed herself and he says anytime he gets on the elevator on that side of the building, he smells flowers. Our night auditor heard someone opening and closing cabinets in the breakfast area located next to the front desk even though she didn't see anyone walk past her. When she went to check it out, every cabinet was open as if someone was looking for something but there was no one there. she told me that when i came in for a morning shift to relieve her and said that's not the first time one of the ""ladies"" was looking for something.",47,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF02DAC0>
507,"If you tell us not to clean your room, your room won’t be clean. Should be simple, right?","A very angry guest came to me at front desk, around 2 PM. Apparently, we didn’t clean his room for two days in a row. Of course I apologized profusely and told him I’d have housekeeping up in his room within twenty minutes tops. I offered him to go to the restaurant and enjoy a nice cup of coffee and a piece of cake on the house while we get his room ready.

When I talked to housekeeping, I got the real story. Turns out this guy had a “do not disturb” sign up all morning and noon. He had removed it less than 15 minutes before he came down to me to complain. The day before, it had been there the whole day. No wonder nobody had gotten his room cleaned.

When he came back from the restaurant I politely asked if he would know when he would want us to clean his room tomorrow so I could have housekeeping on standby. For some reason, that made him blow up. He yelled at me that he is paying good money for the room and therefore housekeeping should ALLWAYS be ready to clean his room when HE wanted it. That was our JOB after all. I was so perplexed that I could only apologize again, which seemed to appease him.

Luckily he only stayed for two more nights and didn’t have the sign up the next morning so we didn’t have to have one of my colleagues stand in front of his room until his majesty decided that NOW was the one and only acceptable time to clean the room.",74,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF02DAF0>
508,Broke lady GETS 2 FREE NIGHTS?,"Another day, another Karen to make me question why I ever filled out my first application to work as a Front Desk Host 7 years ago.

&#x200B;

It's the start of my shift, and I come in with my venti iced chai that I was 5 minutes late for. My manager greets me, I put down my bag, and let out a sigh as the magnets on my name tag clack together. Officially on duty.

I step up to the desk, and get the run down from the AM shift. Really, all I am interested in is my Chai, since it sounded like a slow day.

But then, *she* gets mentioned.

""Yeah OP, I tried to run 708's card again (like I had done the night before, since she came up on our high balance report, and her CC didn't go through. Made a note in our MOD report), and nothing. Try to get in touch with her if you can, since she has a reservation to extend. Have a good night""

The AM shift departs.

With a sigh, I decide to call up to 708 ""Hi there miss, this is Op at the front desk. Would you mind coming down to speak with me about the outstanding balance on your room? the Credit card we have isn't going through""

She comes down, and her tirade starts.

Turns out, she has had a really long night, and doesn't need us bothering her all day about a couple of dollars (98.23 to be exact). She tried to swipe her card, and na-da. Tries a different card, and na-da.

I am in the middle of trying to figure out what's going on, and she calls the bank.

Turns out my AM shift ran 13 authorizations on her card for random small amounts (trying to collect any balance towards her bill). Despite all authorizations declining, the man on the phone tells her that her account got over drawn, by the exact amount my AM shift ran (minus $5, which was the last $5 she had on the planet).

She turns to me, fury in her eyes.

Her tirade evolves into a full fledge shit-storm. How dare *I* take the last amount of her money? How did *I* even get that card on file ? (She gave it to us?????) *I* am stealing from her!

I apologize, and let her know that my AM shift was just trying to collect the payment, that we used the card she gave us at check in (duh), and that we are just running our business, which she consented to pay for.

She just gurgles up more random crap, and I am being worn thin. I decide to take a second, step to the back, and tell my manager what's going on to get some back up.

It's to note, that I am the FOM. I went to our Operations Manager. We discuss how she owes us money, but also wants to extend, but her card has zip on it.

Anyone in the industry would expect an answer of: ""Well if she can't pay, she can't stay"".

Not. Today.

My Manager goes out to this guest, apparently with extreme generosity in her heart, and proceeds to make a deal with the guest:

If the guest promises that she can pay for the room later this week when she has money, and gets paid, we would comp her tonight (Sunday) in good faith.

The guest states that she NOW wants to check out on Tuesday.

My Manager gives her ANOTHER free night.

The guest agrees, and leaves smiling, flipping me the bird as she ascends the elevator.

My manager says:

""Have faith in people, OP. You have to learn that people will do the right thing in the end""

...What?...

UPDATE 1.19.2022:

To the shock of NO ONE, she wasn't able to pay the balance of her second night (before the two nights were comp'd). So, our broken Karen got 3 free nights. 

Moral of the story:

At my property, if you don't have the ability to pay, we will give it to you!",83,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF02DCA0>
509,I'm Not Happy Unless The Room Is Free,"Back in December my hotel was sold out due to families traveling for the holidays. Where my hotel resides is right beside i95 and it was backed up. I'm talking about cars in one spot for more than 4 hours. People were standing beside their cars to have a smoke or walk their pets and some even ""relieved"" themselves. And I live 10 minutes away from work but had to leave everyday an hour early due to the awful traffic. 

Anyway, I get to work and we have 3 rooms left to sell. I go to clock in and print out the evening reports in case of system failure. Within the first 10 minutes, we were sold out, and I had to face the 20 or so more families in my lobby who did not book in advance to turn them away. Took about 30 minutes but once I passed out my list of local hotels and motels in the area, many of them were happy. I gladly put up a Sold Out sign.

So, a couple who got one of our last rooms comes back down to the front desk. The wife is obviously drunk. I could smell her breath on the other side of the counter. The husband is taking pictures of the floor, the ceiling and the doors. Weird but whatever. My co worker, a new person, ask them if everything is ok with the room. Meanwhile, I have went to the back to shuffle some paperwork but I can overhear everything. This couple starts berating the hotel.

Wife: How old is this place?

Co Worker: I'm not sure but I think its 10 years or older

Wife: Well it certainly looks like it. 

Husband: We stayed at (another hotel) in (a different city and state) last night and it was much nicer and cheaper than this place.

Co Worker: ""who is obviously trying to do her work and avoid them"". I'm glad you guys had a good stay with (other hotel).

Wife in a typical Karen demanding tone: Well, due to how crappy this place is, you BETTER give us a discount. Give us the rate we payed last night.

Co Worker: I can't do that but I can take about $10 off.

Husband and Wife who is not happy with that answer: This is the crappiest hotel we've ever stayed in. You better believe I'm sending these pictures to your corp office.

This goes on for another 10 minutes before they ask to speak to a manager. There is none on duty. So, my co worker comes to get me. She usually can handle herself pretty well but when she came to the back office I can see the frustration and the eagerness to slap them both in the face. I go out and the conversation goes:

Wife: She promised us a discount because our room isn't good

Me: What seems to be the problem with the room?

Wife: ""proceeds to tell me about her stay last night"". I don't feel clean in here. I don't feel safe and I'm totally uncomfortable. And I stay in hotels all the time. Never had any issues. How are you gonna compensate us?  Red Flag!!!! Meanwhile, someone who ignores the sold out sign on the door comes in desperate for a room.

The wife now turns from berating the hotel to me and the other staff members. Ok. Let's play. 

Me: Ma'am I'm so sorry that our hotel is not up to your standards. I do not want you to have to stay in a hotel that is gonna make you uncomfortable or uneasy. 

I turn to my maintenance guy and ask him to please escort the couple and their luggage downstairs. You see where this is going!?!

With that I turn back to the wife.

Me: Ma'am, I'm going to do something even better for you. I'm going to cancel your room with no penalty. Have a good night. 

I gestured to the desperate man who walked in to give me a moment. My maintenance guy had come back down and whispered the room was clean and could be resold. I booked the desperate man and gave him $10 off because why not!?! I didn't give the unhappy couple a chance to protest anything. They walked past the front desk looking pitiful and sad. I knew that their behinds would be sitting in traffic in the cold unable to find a hotel room for A VERY LONG TIME. What were they going to say? Why would you WANT to stay in a hotel that is so crappy? Unless you were intentionally looking for a free room.",69,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF02D070>
510,What a way to start work,"So I just got to work, I was in the bar counting heads like usual and chatting with security to see if there was anything I should be made aware of.

This long haired guy stumbles up behind me, and puts his hand on my shoulder, then with his other hand he decides to rub all the way across my lower back and try to grip me by the side.

I’m not gonna lie I froze up in disbelief. Like seriously? Who just walks up to another human and puts their hands on them? 

Security steps up and looks the guy in the eye and goes 

“ hey you got a problem guy?”

I took two steps forward to get away from grabby dude and turned around.

This guy goes “nope”

And then he starts to wander off, all the while giving security the stink eye.

Security is of course not having this and keeps asking what his problem is.  Dude keeps walking and security lets it go.

So here I am, feeling like I need someone to pour boiling water on me. I hate people some days. Like a lot. Also wondering when people will start getting tossed out of the bar for sexually assaulting employees.

Bonus: the day our cocktail waitress had some complete jerk stick his fingers in her mouth.

So this regular customer walks up to our cocktail waitress and says hello to her, she opens her mouth to respond and he shoves his fingers in her mouth and starts laughing like it’s a joke.

She is infuriated as she should be. But for whatever reason she decides not to tell anyone or do anything about it.

A few hours later I show up to do my shift, and I could just see that there is something wrong. So I ask her about what’s bothering her. 

She tells me, and I ask who, tell her to point him out to me. She asks why and I tell her he isn’t welcome here if he behaves that way with our staff. She of course won’t tell me cause she doesn’t want to make a big deal out of it at work. 

Instead she found him outside of work and kicked the doors of his truck in. One of those new expensive dual cab diesel ram trucks.

So I guess after all the ranting my most pressing question is; why won’t people keep their hands to them selves?",48,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF02D100>
511,"I'm sorry that you won't be able to get fresh towels and linen on a daily basis, your Majesty, but please utilise your tiny brain and have some sympathy for the people wash, fold and deliver it.","EDIT 1: Fixed up the glaring errors in my post. 

EDIT 2: To all of the Redditors that messaged me questioning my mental health status, I question my own sanity some days. I think we all have. This post was a way for me to vent my frustrations. I probably should not of posted this straight after the fact and at near exhaustion. To out it as nicely as I possibly can, You may not agree with or like what I've written, but to make assumptions on my mental health status is insensitive. 

 
RANT: I'm really bloody angry right now after an entitled wannabe social media influencer guest checked in about 15 minutes ago for a 1 week stay.

She had requested daily fresh linen and towels, and proceeded to chuck a hissy fit when I told her that due to a temporary supply shortage of fresh Laundry due to Covid, we are currently only changing linen and towels every 3 days on request.

I know what you're thinking, that interaction couldn't of made you turn green with anger and fist smash the desk in the back office right? You're nearly right....I turned green because my fist missed the big empty space on the desk as I went to hit it in frustration. Instead of hitting the desk, Derpy hulk here managed to knock over his bowl of freshly made guacamole and it went everywhere.

I hope the next shift likes typing on a guacamole infused keyboard...
...I should of gone to Spec Savers.


My anger has been the culmination of what can only be described as acts of Covid related selfishness by people (commonly referred to as 'Dumb C**ts' here in Australia), I know this is not a new phenomenon, but it has definitely reached a whole new level of c**tiness here in Queensland as the borders reopened. The guest interaction was just  the straw that broke this camels back.

Combine this with near exhaustion from working 23 days straight and you have a perfect storm.

A little bit of background, hopefully this all makes sense to all of you. 

So,  my main job is working the front desk at a medium sized Property in Brisbane, Australia. After what seemed like an eternity of snap lockdowns and border closures, Queensland re-opened its borders to all other Australian states in December.

Whiles working at the Front desk is my main job, I also serve breakfast 5 days a week and do maintenance where and when I can. 

I also moonlight as a Stripper on the weekends here for some extra cash. I can strip the linen from an entire 2 bedroom apartment quicker than magic Mike can rip his Velcro pants off. My wife has never been so proud of me.

Where was I, oh yes, the border reopening.

So, while the expected flood of 'Mexicans' that have migrated from New South Wales and Victoria has been great for our occupancy rate (we've had 100% occupancy since 20 December), my states current explosion in Covid positive cases (over 20k new cases today) is causing unintended shortage of fresh linen, amongst other things 

To add a little perspective for the people reading this not living in Australia, prior to December 20, we had less than 10 active cases here. With the current spike in positive cases here, supply chains nation wide are being affected as staff shortages get worse. 

Even our national supermarket chains are struggling to get stock onto their shelves. 

Because of this, our laundry supplier (I won't name them, but I am sure Brisbane followers will have an idea who I'm referring to), are now struggling to meet demand as nearly half of their workers are currently in isolation.

To make sure we have enough clean sheets and towels everyday, we have changed from daily service to 3 day service on request to try and preserve stock. But I know what we're all thinking...why do guests insist on fresh sheets and towels everyday? We all know they don't do the same where they live.

Most of our orders are not being entirely fulfilled as their no doubt exhausted employees struggle to keep up with the demand all while working longer hours. But they still let us know on delivery day what items will be missing which is fantastic. Their poor delivery drivers are sometimes delivering to us late as 10pm and copping abuse for it (our delivery time is usually 3pm) Call centre staff are also copping constant verbal abuse for a situation that they have no control over.  

I was told by a driver last night that one call centre staff member is refusing to go back to work after being abused by a hotel duty manager. She left in tears and visibly shaken and had to be driven home by a colleague.

It's a sad state of affairs when a very small minority of hotel staff are abusive to a laundry supplier. Nobody deserves that, EVER, especially from Manager! Hearing it was a Manager pissed me right off, which is why I'm ranting. On second thought, should I be surprised it was a Manager that did that. 🤷. I really hope a complaint is made against that Manager.

Statistically speaking, I am confident that at least  95.638% of hotel staff here in BrisVegas would never behave in such a way. Most of us make it through a Riverfire weekend (barely) without a single guest being murdered (even though we think about it many times) and year in, year out, we successfully manage to deal with the annual migration of thousands  cocky, gloating Blues supporters during State of Origin. 😋😂

I for one appreciate the shit out of my supplier, as we can't function as a hotel without linen. I don't understand why someone would go out of their way to piss off a critical supplier. Seems counter intuitive to me.  🤷

If anyone from that company happen to read this, you guys are awesome, especially Paul who delivers to us....there's a carton of beer with your name on it you can collect on Monday.

Id also like to offer assistance to any hotels in the Brisbane area that gets caught short for linen unexpectedly, please PM me directly on here and if I can spare any, I'd be more than happy to help out where possible.

I'm also open to any ideas or advice on how I van manage my linen shortage better, so feel free to chime in with any constructive criticism. 😁

Please excuse any glaring errors in my post. Just finishing 23 days straight and exhausted.

Stay safe!",68,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF02DF70>
512,manager wants to ''observe'' and ''test'' me while i work,"Hi

I've made a couple of posts about this hotel that I work at. I'm a housekeeper there.

Long story short: in this hotel, apparently, i am a horrible cleaner who never does anything right (not true) and now they are gonna do another training period for me.

I've worked there for 3 months already.

They obsess over meaningless arbitrary things and overreact. The manger will get mad, then not tell why. But give me attitude all day, to the point where Im fighting back the tears.

&#x200B;

Today I had a horrible uncomfortable experience and I cant make out if I really am to blame for everything.

So, I had finished all rooms except for one, which still needed cleaning.

I ask for the manager to bring me sheets (Because i am not allowed to take sheets by myself, he HAS to place them in the room for me - because apparently my back is so fragile that I cannot manage to carry them to the room.... -.-)

He brings me the sheets and I wait eagerly for him to leave the room, so I can finish it and go home.

Then he says: I will stand here and watch you make the bed, so I know that you're doing it right

And I told him straight away, that I am not comfortable being watched by anyone while I worked - he is welcome to come and check the room, or even to help me and guide me through the process (I mean, I know how to make a bed, but they insist that I am not capable, sooo....), which upsets him immediately.

He starts going on about how he has a responsibility to make sure I'm doing my work the right way, he is apparently also '''testing'' the other housekeeper (WHICH IS HIS SON!) and that other housekeeper has no problem with him watching, so why do I make it all so emotional and why cant i just stop resisting?

And I insist that I am not comfortable with this situation.

Then he starts yelling at me about my place at work, my work is his work, this hotel is his house, this hotel is my house too, do i even want the job, do i even want to do the work - all of this stuff.

I try to just stick to my guts that Im not comfortable with this ''testing'' experience.

After a long time of him yelling me and getting mad cause I don't wanna do what he says. He ends up making the bed WITH me. I know how to make the damn bed, I've been making beds everyday for 3 months.

I don't know if this is normal or not?

I cannot tell if I'm in the wrong, cause I refused?

I feel uncomfortable and like he is too ''personal'' and thinks that this hotel is like the gem of Paris (which is where it is located), when it is really just a run down hotel like so many others.

Idk.

I've decided to start looking for work elsewhere, cause that was very uncomfortable. No means no..

&#x200B;

after we finish the room, I am on my way to leave. THe guest comes back to be in the room, and the manager starts speaking in Spanish saying ''esta llena'' - i don't know what this means, but i understood the ''meaning'', in that he was saying basically that I am a crazy person 

I'm just so tired of this",77,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF0CC310>
513,"Oh, so you're related to the queen?","So, I work full time Night Audit at a resort, as well as working security at a small, corporate hotel. This comes from  when I was working my security job. Seven days a week. Fun.

So this woman had been in the lobby for about an hour, Night Audit had said nothing about her, she was reasonably well dressed, and had her bags with her, she had her phone plugged in and was texting on it, not causing any fuss, she looked like she was waiting for an Uber, which is not uncommon. So I largely ignored her.

So after an hour or so I asked the Night Audit what was up with her. N/A said that she had been dropped off, requesting a room, but the woman was obviously off her nut so she declined the nutcase a room rental. However N/A said that the nutcase could charge her phone. Okay fine. I was going to let it go, but then the nut case asked me where there was an ATM. We don't have one in the hotel, so I told her there was one up the street.

And then she started.

She started by telling me that ""her boyfriend had groupies that were stalking her and he was part of the Jersey Shore, and all his groupies were after her, and his family in the mob had stolen seven grand out of her bank accounts and she was trying to get a restraining order, but needed a Federal agent, and she's related to the queen so she knows people, and she's from New York so she knows people, and she's a St. Louis housewife and her husband is a federal agent, and then she needs to go back to her house in New Jersey, and she has money so she doesn't stay in places like this, and the CIA........""

The cyclical conversation of someone a few days off their meds.

After she mentioned the CIA I really stopped listening.

So, I interjected and told her  she had to go, and she was okay with that.......at first, until she tried to put her bags behind the desk. Then I told her that she needed to leave and couldn't come back. Then she told me to call the police because, ""they dropped her off, so they can pick her up."" and then went outside to sit on the bench. So I called the police and a few minutes later a cop arrived.

The cop looked at me for an explanation, and I twirled my finger never to my head, the universal sign of ""crazy"". He rolled his eyes, he asked her name, she gave it, and the cop says, ""weren't you spoken to a couple hours ago for trying to break into an Air BNB?"" Later he told me nobody pressed charges because she's nuts. 

She demanded a ride, he told her he was not a taxi, and then she screamed at myself and the cop, threatening to have as fired, usual fire and brimstone that never turns into anything. She then left, screaming as she walked down the street.",85,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF0CC2B0>
514,The credit card has to be in your name,"working Night Audit, it's always hilarious to me how often someone will try to check into a room by presenting a credit card that quite obviously does not belong to them. i'm talking completely different name, from a person that is definitely not in their traveling party. they confidently present that card with their ID and are completely shocked when i tell them the CC needs to be in their name. and then you already know what comes next: the plea to just charge the card ""on file."" if you thought they were shocked before, just imagine their astonishment when you tell them that you need to verify the credit card with the cardholder's ID in order to do that. just hilarious to me how people walk around with other people's credit cards and get so frustrated when it doesn't fly here. because 95% of businesses don't care and would never know but when you come into a respectable hotel, we will call your bluff and shut you down.",63,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF0CC1F0>

516,Supposedly I'm in charge of online rates,"I had a guy call in about an hour ago which started politely enough until I quoted him a rate for a single king room. After I gave him the price there was a sizable pause and then he said 

Clueless: Your online rates say $5.

Me: That is before tax and if you enter today's date the price will likely change. Our in house rate is XXX, may I book a reservation for you?

Clueless: No, why are you going to charge me more to hold a room IT SAYS online $.05. 

Me: I apologize sir, whatever 3rd party rate you are able to find online needs to be booked through the 3rd party, otherwise our rate is XXX.

Clueless: That's false advertising.

Me: Again ~~dumbass~~ Sir, I can offer you an inhouse rate of XXX but if you choose to book through a 3rd party the rate may be different.

Clueless: Why are you advertising a different rate on line its $.04 online and you're telling me XXX. YOU need to update your website I'm not paying more than $.03.

I tried to explain the situation again as clearly as I could and he hung up on me. If you book through Trifoghoe or other websites please enter the correct dates. Better to book directly.",64,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF0CC0D0>
517,New Scam,"I had a guest call asking to cancel same day due to covid and testing positive. I explain our rules, need to see positive test and she did. I look up her reservation and it’s from fauxpedia or in her case on of their off shoots. 


I tell her she must call them to cancel. We would wave the cancel fee. Everything should all be good. You already know it’s not  

She called me back asking about if she did something wrong or right to cancel the reservation. She googled the offshoots phone number and they told her she had to get a gift certificate from Wall drugs green. She was smart and first called them to see if that was something she could do. They said no so she called me and asked what to do and I confirm to her it was a scam. 


I’m so glad she didn’t fall for it and we got everything squared away and the reservation canceled without penalty. I have never even heard of this. This is why you never click on the first link when you search for something these days. Oh yeah and fuck Googly. How do they allow these sites to be on their website??  

So just an FYI tell guest to look at their email to get the contact information for the third-party crap sites not Googly.  


Seriously though what the fuck.",41,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF0CC070>
518,"I Booked Multiple Nights, So My Arrival Date Is Optional","Welcome back to the Legal Garden circa 2017/2018.  To explain the timing, I drew the short straw and had to work PM after working audit the previous night.  

The guest in question booked a multi-night stay, but he never showed up.  Now normally given his stay length (4-5 days) I would have just pushed back the check- in date as maybe he had an early flight and wanted to guarantee a room.

Unfortunately for him, we were oversold his second night, so his reservation was canceled meaning we were no longer oversold.

I arrive for my shift(took a vacant-dirty double room that had one guest, so I got a few hours sleep), and all is well at first.  

Maybe an hour or two in, a guest arrives to check-in, and you can see where this is going.

Yes, it is the no show from the previous night.

I try to explain to him the situation, and that his reservation was cancelled as he never arrived on his arrival date, nor do we have a record of him altering said date.

He gets furious that we have no room for him, and he says that since he booked multiple nights that, “It’s his right to check in when he wants”.  The guest throws a tantrum (ie. pacing back and forth and sitting on couch with arms crossed pouting) and refuses to leave.  I have to threaten to call the police, and it takes his kids begging him to leave that he finally does.

However, he doesn’t leave the property.  Instead, he sits in his car outside the main entrance.

The kicker is that a couple minutes later, I take a call to cancel a reservation that matches the room type the first guest wanted.  Now, he is still parked outside, and I could easily sell him the room.  However, I can be petty/vindictive.

A minute later, I get a call asking if we have any rooms available, and I sell our last room.  Another minute later, and the first guest drives off.",212,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF0CC340>
519,A stroke of bad luck for you and I,"Hello, again my people, 

I have been plagued with another story at my place of employment. This has reminded me why I shouldn’t go out of my way for guests. I know I still will because it’s my ~~kink~~ weakness. I’m usually a second shift kind of pal, but sometimes I get to work the quiet morning shift coveted by most of the front desk agents. 

This story starts when I was working my usual; I was checking in guests and generally being polite and informative. I’ve had the usual requests,

“Could I get a room away from the elevator?” ""Sure!""

“Could I get a room high up?” ""Is the 6th floor alright?""

“I want a room with a view.”  ""Of course, I do have this upgrade available for 10 bucks."" 

This night, I had a lady ask for a room next to the pool because she’s from America’s hat and she wants to enjoy the spa. It’s like 40 degrees but whatever floats your boat lady. I inform her that I legitimately do not have a room on the ground floor and that she’s booked a mountain view room… Which are usually the higher floors. I only have rooms on the second floor, and it would be a downgrade (not really, just price-wise) so I really don't want to move from her. I just explain to her that I do not have any rooms next to the pool and think that’s that. Time to advertise our restaurant because it’s actually pretty slow and they need business. 

She interrupts me to explain ***she’s from America’s hat*** and ***has a two-day reservation*** here so maybe she can ***get that room*** tomorrow??? Here’s where I made my first mistake, knowing I was going to be working a morning shift the next day, 

“Sure, let me see what I can do.” 

I'm a people pleaser, I can't help it. It's psychological trauma from childhood and I didn’t know I shot myself in the foot yet. I was going to switch her room and get her next to the pool like she asked because I was a good person.

She continued to bother me throughout my shift for small things and eventually tipped me like 5 bucks. Cool. I checked to see if I could get her a room, looks like two will open up tomorrow, cool. I’ll just inform housekeeping to let me know when they become available. Cool. I await the end of my shift like always. 

My FOM texts me asking me to come in later on in the day so I can stay until 6, cool. When the lady comes around next, I inform her to please wait until 10 am-ish so I can make the changes for her room. She understands and asks about breakfast, I check her reservation, she doesn’t have complimentary breakfast and I inform her so. She understands and goes to her room for the night.

The next morning, I come in to find my GM covering the front desk. As I’m getting myself situated, he asks,

“Hey, do you know anything about this room?” And guess who it is. America’s hat. Apparently, she came by today to ask about her complimentary breakfast. **What.** I explain that she wants a room by the pool and I was going to grant her wish. Which is fine by him, and he leaves me to it.

I had a great day, it was very quiet, and dead; just seeing guests off, recommending restaurants, and airlines calling in for pickup. I had rooms to give to any early check-ins. I had preassigned the airline rooms and I was on a roll; on top of that, the room I had selected for this lady was vacated early that morning and was next on the housekeeping’s list. 

She comes down and asks about the room; I say housekeeping is still cleaning the room. She checks out the pool and informs me the spa is cold. Me, not knowing how fucking hot tubs work, wave away her concerns and explain it’ll eventually warm up. She’s excited and heads back to her room. 

At this point, I should’ve asked maintenance to look at the spa before I do anything. Had I known the gods would toy with me and break the hot tub, I would’ve put a stop to any room moves and taken the L. I would’ve been fine and not had a small mental breakdown. Housekeeping informs me the room and the room next to it is clean, I enact my plan and inform the lady the room is clean and ready for her to move into. I’m still high on my mood today and better yet, I’m actually doing good for once. This lady is so appreciative she gives me another 5. She moves, and I inform housekeeping to clean her old room and they do. 

Alas, my problems began. She heads out to the pool and spa and comes back to bother me about where the little timer thing is, I go out and show her where. Maintenance is there as well, and as I go back in, he’s talking to the lady. He comes in and explains to me what’s happening. 

**The hot tub is not working.** 

Better yet? The part they need probably won’t come in until the next day. I remember the time down to the minute in which my day began to sour. **12:48pm**. I head out to her, bringing water, a breakfast coupon, and a free cocktail coupon to express my sorrow for her plight. I offer my peace offering, and she informs me she’s already got a breakfast coupon, ***he*** gave it to her. She accepts the water and free drink though and continues to bask in the sun. I go back to my desk wondering how the maintenance man gave her a breakfast coupon already. 

The maintenance man asks me if everything is okay and I say yes. A couple of hours go by and she comes back to the front desk and informs me her door is not closing properly. This poor lady. **My poor luck.** I inform maintenance and they take a look, nothing until about 30 minutes, she calls the front desk and asks to be moved to another room. She’s not comfortable. Understandable. At this point my coworker is here as well, we check out her next room which is right next door. Everything is in order and we move her. 

At this point, my GM comes by to shoot the shit and spots the unused breakfast coupon I wrote for her. He asks me if I made that today, I say I did and that I had some trouble with America’s hat lady. He says he already gave her free breakfast coupons and why was I doing that. 

“Is she with somebody???????” 

I know it’s not his fault, but had he informed me **he gave her free breakfast** already, I probably would’ve never moved her out of spite. and for what btw I shall never know. After he left, I was informed by our morning shift shuttle driver that she complained earlier that morning.

**This bitch.** At this point, I am emotionally exhausted. She has been bugging me since last night, and my *get-out-of-jail-free* cards were used up by my manager for some reason. She comes back. Now she’s furious; the blinds are broken in her new room.

“-- the window is facing the freaking parking lot!!! Please just move me back to my old room. At least I know everything works in there!!” 

I was absolutely done. I checked for her old room and made the change. Both ground floor rooms were thankfully vacant ready after maintenance fixed the issues because she did not spend any time in either; had the head housekeeping take a look and everything. She complained some more and asked for compensation so we comped her dinner as well. I was extremely tilted for the rest of my shift. I suddenly had things to do, files to file, phone calls to call whenever she came or called again after that. 

She should’ve checked out today; I decidedly did not answer my phone when my manager called me to cover another shift. I know it’s no one’s fault. Just a stroke of bad luck. The stars aligned and whatnot. 

I just learned a very emotionally taxing lesson on trying to be good to whiny-ass bitching guests. My apologies to the maintenance men, and housekeeping who had to fix the mistakes my dumb ass made. Last I heard, she complained some more about losing her phone charger. Don’t be like me, I gambled and lost on the cool front desk agent wheel of misfortune. 

TL;DR Whiny guest asks for a different room, gets comped three ways from Sunday, and the real MVPs are the housekeeping staff and maintenance. ",50,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF0CC220>
520,I Need A Vacation...,"It is one thing when a guest does something that really grinds your gears. Customer service is and always will be a toss of a coin from day to day. However... When it comes to your fellow coworker, is it really that hard to ask for equal amount of give a crap?

I'm not going to bore you with the details because believe me, there are way too many, but I'm really getting sick and tired of being the only one that comes in and performs my duty to the fullest that needs to be and can be done.

No amount of notes; no amount of hints or suggestions seem to be absorbed and retained.  I don't want to have to pick up the slack for every, and yes I mean EVERY, person that works with me.

Now I could just follow the pack and be lazy, but it is not something that is within me to have such low work ethic.  Not to mention we do get annual inspections that could very well leave us all without a job.

521,Spooky Halloween guest... short stay,"It was Halloween night and it was pretty late when this guest comes to the desk dressed as the grim reaper. All he had with him was a toy knife and a bottle of lotion. So he comes to book a walk in, we set everything up for him and he goes on his way. A few hours later he comes down with a woman and his bottle of lotion, he gives her a hug and says thank you, she walks away and he comes to the desk and says ""I'd like to check out"". Thank you, you did not need to check out and you could've just left or gone back to the room like why did he have to make it so painfully obvious what was happening",14,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF0C60D0>
522,My Attitude Problem,"To preface this, I am a gentle person. I have always been told that from people who know me. I am not shy, but I try to phrase everything as kindly as possible, especially at work. The intention behind this is that, you never know what day someone had.

Anyways,

I am working at the desk on some daily reports, keeping a mindful eye out for any approaching guests. I just got the news that another co-worker is calling out due to Covid, so I am covering the bar, serving any guests food, as well as the desk. 

 It's to also note that, our property's key system is older. We still swipe the keys, not remote access, blah blah.

Do I want to blow my brains out? Certainly. Am I holding it together? Actually, very well. Thank you Hydroxyzine. 

&#x200B;

As I am working through mindlessly initialing every report I just printed, our beloved guest Karen, approaches me.

Her hair is in a rat's nest, she's carrying two bags like a baby, despite them having straps that would make handling them less cumbersome. She throws her two key cards, and a torn to shit key packet on the desk.

Without giving me a second to even put down my pen down, she unlocks the hinges of her jaw. 

Karen: ""Are you even going to acknowledge me??"", flecks of spittle flying over her mask, which is acting as a chin diaper today.

Me: ""I am so sorry, you just popped up while I was putting down my paper work.  What can I help you with today?""

Karen: ""My keys aren't working, fix them""

Me: ""Not a problem, can I just take a quick peek at your ID?""

K: ""Are you serious? that's the last thing I want to do after a long day of work. Give you my ID. That's ridiculous. I'm holding these bags""

Me: ""I am so sorry, I do just have to double check. You're more than welcome to set the bags down if you'd like"" \*gestures to a chair\*

K: \*Grumbles, and literally drops the bags on the ground. She pulls out her wallet from her Mary Poppin's purse (if Mary Poppins kept prescription pills and trash in her purse), and finally shows me an ID\* ""Yeah, it's really me. You can't ask for ID if you aren't an officer, just so you know""

Me: ""Thanks for understanding, let me get you a new key"" \*Makes them, and hands them to her\*

K: \*Snatching them out of my hand\* ""I want you to tell me why they stopped working""

Me: ""Oh, well, did you have them near a phone, credit cards, any technology?""

K: ""Do I look like someone who would do that? Of course I didn't!""

Me: ""Hm, I am not sure what to tell you. I don't really know why""

K: ""WHAT? You have been so rude. I am going to talk to (Sales Manager) about how you treat your guests. Thanks for being a dick to me"" \*grabs her bags, and storms away\*

I work Night Audit. I do some laundry, paperwork, play video games and watch tv. And make breakfast. So its not bad. Its just I dont want to be the last one standing and get screwed.

Most recently I worked for a month somewhere that my previous GM went to. For that entire month I couldn't clock in or access the system at all. So I finally said I wasn't coming in until I could do all the things... I only let it go this far because the GM is like a mother to me..... Long story short.... I never got in the system so I refused to come back. And when I went to collect my pay I had no check waiting for me. I had to argue with them just to get paid. I feel like if the GM wasn't so close with me that I wouldn't have been paid at all....

But anyway...

Now I've decided to go the corporate hotel route. I'm sick of busting my butt for no appreciation. I'm sick of having to fight for time off to see family, or even to have a mental health break.

528,“WHY are your rates high”,"I live in a small, suburban town. We have a lot of companies nearby, and most importantly we have several colleges within a 10 mile radius. May means graduation for most students, and many parents are cut throat, meaning the gm jacks up the rate, which the summer does on its own already. 

This older woman calls and asks to book a two bedroom suite (the biggest and most expensive room type in our hotel). 

Me: ok… the rate is $430 a night before taxes. 

(The lowest I’ve seen this room type go for is about $275, but considering the circumstances and high demand for rooms, the rates are gonna go up.)

Woman: wow that’s outrageous. What’s the prices after taxes?

(I fucking hate this question.)

Me: give me a second i have to calculate it…

She then demands to know the amenities, to make sure she gets her money worth i assume. 

Women: well i’m gonna need a discount. Let me give the number. 

(No one has even given me a number for a discount. There are codes, but they involve letters more than numbers)

Me: i’m not sure we take those, if we did you might have to go thru the brand. 

Woman: well imm gonna need something cause that price is so high!

(I check the usual discounts and NOTHING is available lol)

Me: unfortunately there are no discounts available for this date. 

Woman: wow, we’ll i’m gonna go ahead and book it. 

(90% of the time people complain about the prices they don’t book. Can’t wait for this genius to check in.)

Woman: so what’s so special about your hotel that the price is that high?

529,Removing The Diaper From The Fire Alarm: Sentences I Never Thought I’d Say,"*record scratch*

Yep, that’s me, being called up to a room to take a diaper off of the fire alarm. You may be wondering how I got in this situation. Well, that tale starts three days ago.

A guest came by with his family from a nearby hotel. He told me the room there wasn’t clean so he wanted to stay here. We had plenty of rooms so I made him a reservation and checked him in. He seemed like a nice guy, about my age, and it turned out we had some of the same friends at my old university. He asked me to not let anyone know is room number which wasn’t unusual and we wouldn’t have anyway. Then he kept talking and I found out why.

This is when I learned he believed that he was being stalked by an organized group of people everywhere he went, the term being gangstalking. For the rest of the time at the hotel he kept asking if people were supposed to be there, asked if there were cameras in the room, where the food in the bistro came from, etc. 

Today, one of our regulars checked into the room and said there was something on the fire alarm. I went up and you guessed it, he had put a literal diaper over the alarm in case there were cameras.

Over all nice guy but I figured this story would fit here.",32,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF0C6DF0>

531,"Guests feels like he shouldn't pay the pet and the parking fees because they are ""just too much.""","We had a championship game here in the city last night. Our hotel is across the street from the stadium, so the sports fanatics booked rooms here first. Our rooms were ranging from $689-$1,200 a night this week. A truck driver with a discounted rate of $99 (how, I do not know) comes to check in. I make him aware of our Pet Cleaning Fee of $100 and that parking in our lot or garage is $25. He loses it.

**TD:** **Well I was aware of the pet fee, but you expect** ***me*** **to pay $100 for my dog, plus $25 a day for** ***both*** **of my vehicles for a** ***week***\*\*?! That's just too much money. That's an extra $300!!\*\*

**OP: Um... Yes, sir.**

**TD: So what can you do for me? I'll be staying here for a week.**

**OP: Well, sir, your rate is 90% cheaper than the highest rate we have tonight. You're downtown in a major city, so $25 is practically a steal. This is the best we can do for tonight. After the championship game, the street parking will open up and you and your wife will be able to park there for free.**

**TD: Well the confirmation email didn't say anything about this, so I will not be staying here.**

I ask to see his phone and point to all of this information that he missed in the email. My GM comes to the desk at that point, and reiterates what I previously told him.

532,"No, we can't price match HotheadTonight for the fancy kitchen room","*As usual, any names mentioned are alias in place of their actual names. Booking site names are changed due to automod.*

So I've just come in for my night audit shift and I get the passdown from my second-shifter, Alex. They mentioned one particular guest of note.

This guest, who we'll call Chewie Beggar, was here for work purposes and was looking to stay here regularly in the future, and asked to see one of our deluxe kitchen rooms. Alex showed them around the room, and Chewie liked what they saw.

However, the problem was when Chewie asked if we could price-match the super low rate they saw on HotheadsTonight. 
- - - -
So for those not in the loop, HotheadsTonight is a discount online travel agency meant for last-minute bookers. You pay some discounted rate for a room -- lower than what our hotel website and other OTAs like Suspedia and Fucking.com provide, and as you use HT more, your perk level increases  gain access to higher-tier discounts -- but there's a few catches:

1. The res is paid when you book, unlike a traditonal pay-at-the-front-desk booking. 

2. **HotheadsTonight reservations are run-of-house, meaning the hotel will decide what room type you get**; in the case of our property it's the cheapest room possible and if you want to upgrade beyond what we give you, there's going to be an upgrade fee (usually $10-20 per night depending on the severity of the upgrade). 

3. The res is nonrefundable and noncancellable, meaning that yes, once HT succs the money out of your bank account to make your discount-rate booking, you're not getting it back. 

All of this is why HT can get away with rates lower than a limbo stick.
- - - -
Alex wised onto Chewie and straight up said no, part of our price-match policy is that **we only price-match HT for single-bed rooms and for the level 1 price** (i.e. if the guest wants us to price match the even cheaper rate they have with a HT account that has a level 5 perk, or if they want a deluxe room type with the HT rate they want us to price match, tough shit). But Chewie was being difficult and trying to haggle their way to, I dunno, $70-something to stay in our fancy kitchen room when those things are going for $100 rack rate tonight. 

After some debate, Chewie checked in anyway and Alex did offer to have our general manager reach out to them for a negotiated corporate rate for future stays in the morning. Not that they'll probably make use of it. We have another regular who we got a negotiated rate with but quickly went back to booking through HotheadsTonight, and who we assess the upgrade fee to every time they want to stay in the king suite room and who we make fill out the whole reg card every time they book a back-to-back because HT doesn't pass on any guest info besides the name when making our bookings. This regular also has to have their old deposit released as their old res is checked out and a new one taken as their new res is checked in every time they check in for a B2B res, because of the way our credit card system interfaces with reservations; if they just booked directly then we could extend their existing booking, process only the money needed for the add-on nights, and not have to do the whole ""here's your deposit back, and we're taking it again"" routine. But no matter the inconviences and restrictions, these sorts of guests will always book HT because they've stanned HT long enough to have level-8 perks and $45 rates.

This isn't the first time someone tried to be a bag of douches regarding HotheadsTonight price matching. Half a year ago I had someone on the phone one Saturday morning insist I price-match HT for them on a 2-bed room, and when I said that we can't do that, they launched into a minutes-long ramble about how I'm not doing my job and how they're gonna contact our nonexistent ""sales manager"" to set up a res for them (on a weekend at 6 AM, no less? lmao). Between them being a liar with every syllable and lecturing me on being rude over the phone when they're the one talking nonstop and intentionally subverting every chance I had to respond to their nonsense, it was the first time I explicitly told a caller they were being rude and that I was ending the call.

Anyways thank you for calling the Kusoge Inn, no we don't price match for the fancy jacuzzi room, because they don't exist here. How else may I help you today?",6,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF0C6A00>
533,Mini Tales and Rants,"Hello TFTFD Workers and Lurkers!  How is life treating you?  If you are like me, it's the way a dog treats a fire hydrant.

Here for your (hopeful) enjoyment are a few tales from the last week or so, peppered with a little ranting.

Number 1.  Guy has a reservation, comes to check in.  Hands me an ID and a credit card.  Whoops - card doesn't match ID.  When I tell him we cannot accept it, he claims the card belongs to his boss and he uses it ""all over the country and no one has EVER denied him.""  (Well, yay - we are the first!)  I reiterate our policy of cards matching ID's and he says that card is tied to his Super Shiny Reward Membership.  Sorry, bud, but we do not attach credit cards to Reward Memberships, but hey, nice try!  I offer to send his boss a credit card authorization form - he storms out saying ""Well, we will see what CORPORATE has to say about this!""  I guess corporate didn't have anything to say about it because they never called/emailed.   Besides, as my boss says, ""We don't work for corporate, they work for us.""

Number 2.   We have plastic barriers in front of the computer stations, but does anyone stand in front of them?  Nope - let me stick my head in the gap and cough and sneeze at the front desk workers.  I swear I want to spray them in the face with sanitizer when they do that!

Number 3.   Last regular season home game for our local football team, so we know it's going to be busy.  We nearly sell out the night before, but we have some rooms on the 2nd floor available for early check in.  Second floor is NOT acceptable for the privileged ones that come in at 9 am - 2 hours before check out - so they proceed to bitch and whine because they called and were told early check in was possible.  It is possible, but you will be on the 2nd floor.  One woman kept getting louder and louder that she was told she could check in early.  Apparently, checking in early for her means she gets the room SHE wants, not what we have available!

Number 4.  The dreaded ""day by day"" payers.  These people have been here long enough to know that if you wish to extend, it MUST be done by 11 am.  This one particular lady comes down at 11, finds out the rate, never has enough with her and has to go back to the room to get the rest - usually takes her 20 - 45 minutes to come back, sometimes with enough, sometimes not.  I politely told her to call us and we could give her to total so she wouldn't have to keep making so many trips, and she got mad.  I think she wants us to say something like ""Oh, it's okay that you are short $100, you can give it to us later"" but that isn't going to happen.

Number 5.  Guest calls after he checked out and claims he left his gun in the room.  Says he knows he left it ""laying on top of the TV"".  Folks, we have flat screen TV's, so that's maybe 1"" of space on top, so, I don't think so.  He wants to know if we find it, can he just come pick it up.  Nope, if it is found, we have to call the police, who will take possession of it, and they will have to prove ownership and pick it up from them.  Housekeeping tears the room apart, no gun.  Guest calls back to ask if we found it.  I told him the room was thoroughly searched and nothing was found.  

Number 6.  Mr. Patel called a few times - you know, the guy that owns all of our hotels - with some old scams.  I need you to take down these numbers for a package, I need you to take the cash from the till and give it to someone stopping by to pay for a package, and you need to download this program so ""home office"" can have access to the numbers.  I just kept hanging up on him.  Once he called back and said we were disconnected, and I said, ""I know.  I hung up on you.  I don't have time to deal with scammers.""  He hung up, didn't even try to deny it.

Well, that's about it - hope you enjoyed them.  Sorry if you didn't!",29,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF0C69A0>
534,Some nights make me equally happy and frustrated,"Night audit here, these both just happened.  

Guy comes to the desk, politely apologizes for bothering me and asks if he can have a toaster. I happily tell him sure and run and grab him one. You'd think I just gave this man five thousand dollars with how happy and thankful he was. Just really put a smile on my face. 

Then a different guy comes up later to get a key to his room. I look up the room and I have to explain that he's not on the reservation I can't make him a key, only his dad's name is on the reservation so I can only make him a key. The guy walks off in a huff saying ""jeez I didn't think it would be such a big deal!"".  

Sure dude. I'll just make anyone that happens to know the name on a reservation a key to your dad's room. That sounds like a great idea. ""it's not such a big deal"" after all, right?  

Sigh. Toaster guy though saved my night.",10,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF0C68E0>
535,Have these guests ever used a credit card machine before?,"We have an older (six years or so) credit card machine.  And I swear, 90% of my job is spent teaching grown adults how to use a credit card machine.    
""Ok, please insert the card into the machine.  No, don't swipe, its going to ask you to use your chip.  No, the other way.  Ok, it just beeped, what did it ask you?  It says it couldn't read your chip and is asking you to swipe? Ok.  Yes.  Please.  Swipe your card.  Very good sir.  What is the machine asking you to do now?  Enter your pin?  Ok?  Dude, can you just follow the instructions on the machine?  Jesus man, stop wandering off, get off your phone and sign.  Yes, with the pen.  YES YOU HAVE TO PRESS OKAY TO COMPLETE THE TRANSACTION.  QUIT FUCKING AROUND AND HIT OKAY BEFORE THE MACHINE TIMES OUT PLEASE!!! UGH FUCK YOU HAVE YOU NEVER PURCHASED ANYTHING BEFORE IN YOUR LIFE!???""  
I swear to god, how do these people function in real life??  We're a high end hotel, our rooms are very expensive.  What do they do for a living that gives them the ability to afford rooms at our hotel, and yet lack very basic skills like the ability to read a credit card machine??",62,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF0C6880>
536,"Guests choosing to Quarantine at our hotel, kind of confusing.","I don't know about y'alls hotel but we have been getting quite a few people using our hotel to ""Quarantine"" or worse they don't say they have covid until AFTER we have checked them in and they have gone to their room.

I had a group of girls (18 yo) come in with I am assuming one of their parents. She checked them in (didn't mention covid) paid for the room and incidentals and left. The girls later that night wanted a blanket and pillows for their room. I delivered it to their door and they took it from me. THE NEXT DAY apparently they mentioned they had COVID to one of the front desk agents. I was pissed that they didn't tell me until the day after I not only interacted with them at the front desk but also handed something directly to them. If someone has Covid we will leave items outside the door so guests can grab it and there is no interaction.

Then today we found out from a delivery driver that a guest has covid. He didn't tell us even though he has been here for 2 days. Apparently the driver told us that in his delivery notes that he has covid but to leave at his door so he doesn't have to come down to the lobby. Dudes been here for 2 days and didn't say shit. I didn't read our shift notes about this guest until AFTER he came down today and was touching a bunch of shit. I have spent the last 5 or so minutes sanitizing EVERYTHING. 

I understand going somewhere to quarantine so you don't infect your roommates but at the same time you're kinda hustling backwards if you infect staff at a hotel. Also what would happen if there was an outbreak at a hotel and the staff actually all had covid. I want to believe we would do the proper thing and close but I feel like the stupid business model of ""open 365, 24/7"" would be at risk, and corporate would hate that. Its weird they also make our GM be ""hush hush"" if an employee is potentially exposed to covid/sick. I get they don't want us all to panic but I also don't think that is the only reason.",77,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF0C67C0>
537,are you going to turn me down?,"This just happened about 10 minutes ago.  Our renovations have started today, and thankfully it's been a very slow and quiet night for me.  This guy walks in, and asks for a rate for a double.  He's got the rewards membership, so I tell him what that rate is.  Then he mentions his father being a senior, and I tell him that the senior rate is actually a couple dollars more than the membership rate, so that's actually going to be his best rate.  

I look up his membership, confirm the address, then tell him I need his ID, and the machine will take his card in just a moment.  Then he asks the question that always makes me want to ask why are you traveling???  He asks, ""does it matter if I don't have a photo ID?""  Yes it does.  Then the next question.  ""Are you going to turn me down?"" with sad eyes, and his hands turned up.  I assume that's supposed to make me feel sorry for him?  Yeah, I can't help you if you don't have ID.  

I figured he'd bring his father in with his ID, but nope.  Out to his car he went, and drove away.  Without an drivers license.",49,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF0C6760>
538,Bugs everywhere!!,"This guest seems a bit nuts but just a quick funny story that happened to me today.

I’m walking down the hallway and the guest is pacing the hallway in front of his room.  

“Do you work here!”
Uh yes….. also I’m the one who checked you in yesterday and have talked to you and your wife 3 times in the last 3 hours for other random crazy things.  Geez!

“I need to show SOMEONE FOR PROOF!”

He then leads me into the bathroom of his room (meanwhile our head housekeeper is just outside the door to ensure I was safe, gotta love that lady)

“Look! Look! There are bugs all over!”

I proceed to look at his tub and see 2 small black things on the rim and a bunch of black things at the bottom of his tub

I then bend over and pick up the bugs (already knowing what they are)

“Sir………this is lint……and hair

I proceed to roll and pull at the millimetre sized black fuzz and then angrily roll up my sleeve and pull out all the sock fuzz from his tub that would what I would think came from his feet and black sock fuzz.   

“SIR…..THIS IS LINT AND HAIR!

I would say due to his stupidity through the last day of weird crap he says that I wasn’t taking shit and just stared at him like a small stupid kid with a “are you fn kidding me face”

Lmao boss wants him gone tmrw….we’re um sold out now hehe  

Hehe maintenance  also just came to the desk and said that guest has a flat tire and asks if he should go help him.

539,I've been working 12 days straight with no days off,"I'm so tired. I'm just done working at a hotel that doesn't give any benefits. On the one week that I needed to have off, I was called in because my boss caught covid literally 2 hours before I had to cover their shift. --And since it happened on my day off, I hadn't had any proper rest. First day was a goddamn slog, but I didn't complain at the time because I agreed to do it. 

12 Days later, on the literal cusp of my new weekend, they have the gall to ask me to work another day off. I told them no at first, but they made it seem like I had no choice. After pushing back, we did work it out that I would be getting 3 consecutive days off after I work again tomorrow, but I don't know if it's guaranteed. 

On top of it all, I had to move to a new home this week. My priorities are not supposed to be at this damn hotel, it's supposed to be for facilitating the move and helping my family with any issues. But nope, don't have the time for family because I have to be at work. 

I feel like my work/life balance is destroyed. I'm venting here, but after my 3 day weekend that I'm supposedly getting, I'm going to apply for a remote job with actual benefits attached.",73,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF0C6640>
540,Welcome Back! - Have Some Fraud!,"Well it has been a while, hasn't it? So many months of babysitting the area's homeless, followed by a few weeks of sitting in a vacant hotel under renovation.

But now the wait is at an end! The Lacking Tea is back open for regular guests! A few rooms, anyways. Buttercup has been a bit annoyed because the coffee station got moved back to it's regular spot, which means she can't filch sugar packets when she thinks I'm not looking. Feel free to comfort her in her time of need. But we are back to something resembling 'normal' operation.

So of course we get the 'normal' issues...

Tonight, gentle readers, we shall speak of a hamfisted and clumsy scam attempt. The sort that should be made part of training new FD folks, to see how many mistakes that they can spot.

So it came to pass that I walked in for my usual shift. There was one reservation left for the night, not an uncommon situation, perfectly normal. Our newest hire was very excited for me to check and make sure it was done correctly, since in the *six months* that she's been here, she hasn't done an actual reservation yet. Yep, all good, off you go.

Around midnight, the guest arrives. This is the first actual guest I've had to speak with in nearly a year, so I'm glad to be back in the familiar groove. I ask her for her ID and credit card, and she hands over the ID. *Only* the ID.

I explain that I really *do* need the card. She mumbles that it's prepaid. I tell her it's not. She says all she has is the ID. I apologize but hold firm, as my auditor senses are *tingling*. She grumbles a bit, heads out while tapping her phone, presumably to call whomever made the reservation.

Not the first time it's happened, but a bit bummed that it's my first guest back from the hotel's hibernation. Ah well. I go back to noodling about the interwebs on my phone.

About half an hour later, I get a phone call. It's from the woman's father. He says he thought he had paid for it already, but would like a credit card authorization form sent. I pop that off to him.

For those unfamiliar, this is how someone pays for a room without being present. A special form, authorizing the use of the given card, dates and names of those staying, along with pictures of the front and back of the card, and holder's ID. Emailed, faxed (I know right?), or even mailed. Common with business travelers who don't have a corporate account.

Maybe my auditor senses were wrong. Maybe she really was a perfectly legitimate guest. Maybe... Oh wait, here's the form.

Ah. Well then. Attempted fraud it is, then.

Gentle readers, I am now going to try and convey just how horrible this attempt at credit card fraud truly was. In all truth, a rock with 'CREDDIT CAЯD' scrawled on it in what would *hopefully* be mud would have been more legitimate than what the gentleman sent me.

1. The number given on the form doesn't match the card on file for the reservation. It's got a one instead of a zero on one of the final four digits, so that may be a typo.
2. The number given on the form is an invalid card number.
3. The number on the card is completely different from the authorization form.
4. The card is one of those prepaid debit cards, of the 'Emerald Spot' variety. We don't take those.
5. The name on the card does not match the ID. Not even close.
6. While it's *possible* she's actually his daughter, his ID says he's only 39, she has a different name and was at least 21.
7. The authorization has a Nevada address, the ID is for New Mexico, the phone number is local, and her ID was for Wisconsin.

Yeeaahh.. no.

I have done a great many difficult things in my lifetime, but few were quite as difficult as my maintaining a professional veneer as I told the gentleman that I was afraid I could not accept the credit card authorization in it's current state, and that I would wait for him to send an amended one.

After I hung up, I had a good long laugh.

The story ends here, as an hour later it was time to do audit, and I had not heard a peep from either of them. Would have been nice to have had someone in the hotel other than myself and the unicorn, but not someone who not only thinks they can pull a fast one, but also has no idea how to pull one. Take some time to say goodbye to Buttercup, and have a wonderful day.

541,These plague rats are going to kill us all,"This is a story and a rant/vent, whatever.

A guy came up to the desk to extend his stay and was snorking up a storm. It was super gross to listen to, so I tried to get his reservation extended as fast as I could. Initially I was relieved when he stopped, but I wasn't looking at him so I didn't know better. When I went back over to him I discovered that him stopping meant he had snot dripping from his nose like a faucet. It was dripping right down his upper lip and onto his shirt.

I desperately wanted to just run or scream, or run away screaming. It was so gross my fight or flight was triggered. Unfortunately my default response to fight or flight is freeze. So I did that instead until I mustered up the politeness to point it out to him. He waved me off like a mild inconvenience and pulled a wad of toilet paper out of his pocket. He half-assedly wiped at his nose with it, wadded it up carelessly and took another swipe under his nose before stuffing it back in his pocket. His nose continued to run.

Before I could do anything else he snatched up my clipboard to sign his paperwork and put his germy fingers all over my pens and my clipboard. I'm not even a germaphobe. Or I wasn't, maybe I am now. Maybe I was so psychologically damaged by this grown ass man letting his nose run all over the place like a kindergartener that I am now a germaphobe.

I screamed internally while I helplessly watched this adult man get his snot everywhere like it was a normal and okay thing to do any time LET ALONE A GOD DAMN PANDEMIC. He must have heard my internal screaming because he said, ""Don't worry, I'm vaccinated."" SIR THAT'S NOT BETTER. THAT ALSO DOESN'T MEAN IT'S NOT RONA. IT JUST MEANS YOU'RE LESS LIKELY TO DIE IF IT IS. FUCK.

Anyway he left and I baptized myself in bleach and anointed my work space with sanitizing wipes in honor of my new Germaphobian religion.",78,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF0C6520>
542,Who you gonna call? Front desk ghost busters!,"Tl;dr I get called to chase away ghosts. It has a weird twist that I’ll put at the end though.

The entire day was fairly standard hotel wise, guests coming and going, people asking for things to do, concierge booking restaurants outside. It’s of course the smoothest and most boring days that bring the weirdest tales, and as the front desk manager I am of course everyone’s savior.

The lobby security guard pokes his head into the back office and says we have an incident on the 6th floor, there’s a ghost in a guests room. Ok cool, this will spice things up a bit for my dull afternoon. So we power walk over to the building and take the lift up to the 6th floor, the whole time I’m rolling my eyes and thinking what dumb shit I’m gonna find. The door opens, and my guests, a same-sex couple (relevant for the ending) are sitting on the floor, clutching on to each other and in bitter, nearly hysterical crying, flanked by 2 other security guards trying to calm them down, not succeeding very well due to language barriers.

I spend a few moments talking to them, trying my best to calm them down. They were both just wearing boxers so I went to the maid pantry to grab some bathrobes and a tissue box, and finally they calm down enough that they can speak, and they tell me they woke up because suddenly the room got freezing cold and they saw a big muscular person sitting on the edge of the bed, also crying. They completely lost it again while telling me this, so I asked whether they had seen the man exit the room and they said he just “evaporated”.

Obviously something shook them up so I said I’m happy to put them up in another room for the night which they were eager to do and asked if I could go in their room to pack their things for them to bring along while they waited outside. No problem, happy to help. I told one security guard to stay with them and the other two to follow me and sweep the room with me. It took a bit of time cuz it was the biggest suite, but we found nothing out of the ordinary except signs that they did in fact hastily try to escape from the room.

After I put them up in the new room I told the security supervisor to read the door locks, keycard reports and all cctv in case there was a double check in or an intruder. The result came back very conclusive: nobody apart from those two had been in that room, and I wrote up everything as it was and left it at that.

The TWIST: let me start this section by saying I’m the least superstitious person in the world, I do not believe in ghosts but I could see from this couple that something happened there that night. So the next day when I get to work, the director of rooms calls me to her office and asked me what I thought about last nights situation, which I told her pretty much what I just said above. She puts down my printed report and says “many years before you started working here, a man passed away in that room. He was a semi-professional boxer, a really big guy, and he was also gay. We’ve had issues in the past when we put same-sex couples in that room, there’s always some kind of problem or complaint about the temperature or other freaky things happening like ghost sightings. You can make your own conclusions but please issue a departmental memo that we are not rooming gay couples in that suite anymore. If you want to know more, you can go ask our chief of security to see the other reports, he has a folder just for that room.” And true to her word, there were around 10 reports of noises, temperature changes, moving furniture and seeing a big buff guy, all by gay couples.

I know it sounds like some stupid made up story but yeah, there’s something going on there.",38,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF0C6460>
543,"Dear boss, fix it or I quit.","A list of grievances I'll be presenting at the staff meeting, not in order.

1. You said someone is out with covid. You need to tell us so we can practice contact tracing.

2. We need the power to actually deal with unruly guests. I have witnessed blatant theft, property damage, and behavior that would get you kicked out of any respectable establishment. We apparently have no DNR list.

3. You keep adding new procedures with little to no guidance. Coworker E was asking for weeks what you mean by ""elite amenities"" and was ignored. 

4. Maintenance is reactive rather than proactive. This is exemplified by the rooftop incident. If that door had been repaired promptly, then there would have been nothing to complain about in the first place. 

5. You complain about the market being understocked, but the products we request never arrive. Additionally, the inventory form is completely useless, listing things that have never been stocked in my time here and not listing what we do stock. 

6. The task creep is absurd. I am not a prep cook nor a housekeeper. Hire someone else or pay me to do three jobs.

544,Why do they do it in a hotel,"I guess it's best to say trigger warning on this. 

I am an assistant manager. Today my housekeeping supervisor called me up for a wellness check on a guest who was due out. Just standard operating procedures. I was expecting a drunk guest or someone who left the DND sign on the door.

That's not what it was. Housekeeping said they guest way laying funny on the bed. And you can guess where this is going I am sure. He had passed away by personal choice. In ten years of hotel experience this is the first time I have been the first person on scene. I am stuck just wondering why......why do it at a hotel?  Why would you put us through this? 

I have had guests pass before but usually it's by natural causes. This was personal choice and not a calm simple one. Why would they pay our insane rates just to go and do that?

I am so conflicted about it all. The callous nature of the responding Police department - the lack of empathy by upper management - the waste of a person's life. I was having a good day. I had just brought coffee for my team as a moral boost from a long weekend. I was going to get off early because my co-worker was back from COVID quarantine. All of that is just me whining but it's such a juxtaposition of my good morning with my really emotionally wrecked afternoon. 

My manager, who was off, replied to my text messages saying. ""It gets easier the more it happens"". I don't know if I want it to get easier. That was a human being and now they are just.....not.

Edit: thank you everyone for responding. I will talk to HR today. I still have to work my shifts this week but I am going to request PTO. I have been struggling thinking I have to imitate my boss and ""brush it off"" or he won't think I am weak  I appreciate that so many people responded to this and offered advice and kind words. I know suicide is a tough topic and until last night it was just a benign thing to me. But it's not benign and even if a hotel is kinder to their families it's still my ""house"".",208,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF0C6340>
545,I hate the guests/customers that don't understand boundaries,"The restaurant is closed tonight so there is like a little (movable) barricade with signs saying its closed because we don't want people just wondering back there. You probably wouldn't be surprised how many people without the barricade will walk into the restaurant looking for an employee (even though it is completely silent over there and kitchens are you know, loud.)

Anyways this guest wanted some salt and pepper for some food she got delivered

Guest: ""Excuse me, I know the restaurant is closed but can I get some salt and pepper""

Me: ""Sure, I am not sure exactly where it is but I will try to find it"" \*slightly moves barricade to find S & P""

Me: \*Looking literally everywhere for salt and pepper (we usually have small little shakers we give out for room service)

Me: ""Well I cant seem to fin-"" 

G: ""Oh I found it right here!""

She is literally at the cooking line and grabbed a shaker of salt and pepper, and I am stunned that she thought it was okay to walk back here especially when I thought it was clear to wait at the barrier and I would get it for her, also COVID. STOP TOUCHING SHIT! 

Me: ""ummmm..""

G: ""Is it like cool if I grab this"" \*and gave me those creepy ass winks 

M: ""I guess its fine, just leave them out so I can sanitize them.."" (said in a clearly annoyed tone)

This isn't the first time this is happened, I've had people walk back in the restaurant and even wonder around in the kitchen looking for a cook/server (when they are closed). I had one guest last week come down grab a pen and a sticky note from the back office to write me a note while I was in the bathroom. I came down and saw him put everything back real quick and it was fucking weird. It just makes me uncomfortable when there is a clear barrier or boundary and guest/customers just disregard it. Not to mention that our front desk/back office could have personal information (of guests or employees) or personal belongings (as well guest or employee)

Ive never once been to a place of business and thought it was kosher to walk behind the front desk because they weren't there, or just grab something without asking first if it is okay. Maybe its the customer service worker in me that always assumes ""They must be in the bathroom/busy with something"" and wait.",23,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF0C62E0>
546,Fellow manager has been misusing a company tool and now we won't meet our goal for a project,"I am surrounded by intellectuals and scholars, let me tell you.

Late last year, the GSMs at my hotel were told to use this online animation software, which I won't name in accordance with this sub's rules. It costs the company something like $40/month to use, for what reason I could not tell you why. There is no drawing involved; it is all drag-and-drop from a limited selection of ""characters"" who just move around in really awkward and jagged ways really. 

Our assignment is to use the animation website to create a new customer service training program for our hotel. The training program is to consist of fourteen 2-minute clips depicting various scenarios at the front desk. We were specifically told to record our own voices for the assignment. 

This directly contradicted upper management's wishes, but I jumped at the opportunity just to have something good for my portfolio and resume. I was really excited for this project. 

We've been expected to work on the videos during our downtime at work throughout the past few weeks. Outside that, we've been told we have to finish the projects on our own time. We've been short staffed because everyone has covid, so both of us have only been able to work on the project in our free time. 

The other GSM and I decided to split the workload. It was a big job after all. 

He's really fascinated with this animation website, he can't stay off of it. But he has been making these other cartoons instead. His ""show"" has some pretty bizarre characters, such as a talking gorilla who works the front desk and another character based on the owner of our hotel chain (one of the episodes involved the other characters camping out inside his asshole). The animation website has a text-to-speech option with no filter, so you can virtually write whatever you want in the text box. Likewise, the characters in these cartoons say some pretty vulgar things, usually involving feces and the things they want to do with it, and to each other. 

A few years ago, I would have had a really good laugh over this. But seriously, he's made so many episodes of his show with the time he was supposed to be working on the training program! It's infuriating. Every day, sometimes twice a day, he texts me all excited and is like, ""dude I have a new cartoon made, you gotta see it, it's the best one yet"" and I'm just over it lol.

I've only managed to complete 6 of the 14 training videos with my limited free time outside of work, and the project is supposed to be done Wednesday. I know I won't get in trouble when I tell my superiors what happened, but damn, I really wanted this for my resume. I'm going to ask for designated time at work to complete the videos, but other than that, I'm not even going to mess with it. I mean is it even worth it at this point?",49,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF0C6220>
547,I made a mistake,"I work at a small 143 room property in a somewhat busy city, and have been the FDA/NA for about 7 months here. Have been in the industry about 5 years now so I know a thing or two about the usual Dos and Don’ts, but I feel like I made a mistake after my coworker (who’s been here for 10 years) made me feel like shit about it.

My FOM and Director of Operations have, at several instances, told me to make a call as I see fit because they trust my judgement. All I need to do is give them a reason as to why I did something, and that’s all they’ll ask of me if things were to go wrong. 

There’s a traveling nurse who has been making trips to my city every weekend for about 4 months now. She always stays at our property, since we’re conveniently located close to the Hospital she works at. She always has her granddaughter stay in the room with her, and it isn’t uncommon for her granddaughter to check in for her, even if she isn’t always listed as a guest on the reservation. Same thing happened last night, when after I’d handed over the key to the guest, I tried to run the card and it declined. Told the granddaughter to have her grandma stop by the desk to provide another method of Payment when she gets back from work. The lady ends up calling me 5 mins before I left for the night, and I tell her I need another card on file. She also wanted to extend another night, so I begrudgingly told her I couldn’t do that unless I had payment for the first night secured. See, since this guest is a regular, I thought she probably gave the wrong card or sth, so I was more inclined to give her the benefit of the doubt. Told my NA to secure a form of payment from her when she stops by the desk before I left.

Apparently, the guest did stay the night at the hotel, but our NA forgot to take another card from her. And she left this morning without stopping by the desk. I havent received a call from management yet, but my coworker told me that she’s called the guest and informed her that she will be calling the cops on her if payment is not received. A bit much for a regular guest, who also happens to be an old traveling nurse , in my opinion. The guest in turn said that she woukd come by with cash to pay for the room shortly, but it’s been five hours since that conversation. I hope my managers understand my reasoning behind what happened, but I try to be accommodating to the nice ones every now and then, and if the outcome of this whole situation ends up being negative, I’m afraid I’ll stop making accommodations like these in the future. 

Sorry for the long post, I’m just anxious about what will happen now and wanted to know what others think about this.

Edit: I ended up calling the guest and asking them what was up. Informed her of the situation and she said she forgot about the card issues because she came to her hotel room really late and had to leave early in the morning again. Drove over and handed me cash to get her bill settled and was on her way! Got the situation sorted before management comes into the office tomorrow morning!",25,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF0C61C0>
548,"The Siege of the Illiterate Gorillas, ongoing","This is the unholy offspring of a rant and a story. Many stories. And many more to come, I'm sure. 

I'm not sure that this is an uncommon practice, but the two properties that I work between will lock their doors after a certain time so that you have to use your key card to get in. There is a sign at eye level that specifies this. 

But why would it ever be that easy. 

The phenomenon of even the most well educated people becoming completely illiterate in public spaces has long been the bane of many workers who interact with the public. It is now haunting me. Person after person, previously able to communicate at a normal human level, take the leap into monkeytown. Angry pounding on my GLASS door, walking full body into it several times in a row (to trick the sensor? I don't understand), trying to pry them open, screaming at me through the glass. All of this done while staring point blank at the sign with instructions on how to open the door. One man just pounded on the door and stared me down, giving me the most attitudy-judy look he could muster. Once I had flipped my little switch and opened the door, he continued to glare. 

""Just use your keycard,"" I said. 

""I didn't realize I'd have to do that *this time*."" 

To the people out there who aren't behind a desk: If a door isn't working, perhaps look around and think for a moment before taking your rage out on my doors. It's rude, unnecessary, and really, really annoying.",77,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF0C6FD0>
549,I have become Physical.,"Greeting's ladies and germs, it's your local friendly night auditor with another story, this happened last week, so I feel a little more on top of it- having calmed down a bit more, but I feel inclined to share.  
And let me preface this by saying, what I did was incredibly stupid and wrong, and you should never put yourselves in harm's way for a hotel that cares so little about us ants.   


To give some background, I work at a hotel near the airport, as many of you have seen my rants about people expecting some luxury resort know from my previous posts. We're pretty bare bones as far as amenities are concerned, the usual pool/hot tub combo with a workout room and laundry. A standard continental breakfast, everything you'd expect from a three to four-star hotel of a popular chain.  


What I've probably only mentioned once or twice, is that the city had moved a large homeless camp from the downtown area to a cross the road, amongst some trees. And this, dear readers are where my problems begin. It's Storytime.  


A quiet, peaceful night for an Auditor is heaven-sent, never having someone come down to purchase with cash, or banging on your door, trying to bribe you with a reservation after you've run the audit and you already told them you have to charge them for the previous night and then they get offended, none of that. Just a nice, quiet. Serene night.  


And then, a guest happens down, an elderly man with kids at his tails, he's going towards breakfast which has just opened, lovely. But wait, he's approaching my desk. Maybe he's checking out early, or perhaps he has a question?  


The Happy Auditor: ""Good morning, how can I help you?""  
The Elderly man: ""I'm fine, but- I don't know if you knew this, but there's someone asleep on the floor   
next to the elevators.""

  
My world is immediately shattered, my quiet night ruined. At some point, somehow through locked doors a homeless man had apparated on the fifth floor, and in full view of everyone, no less. I knew there were kids, small kids on that floor. So, I immediately set to the elevators and road up to the 5th floor. The doors slid open, and I saw a man there, in a red hoody- bundled up against the wall, a flip phone charging from the wall, two different lights on the ground and tinfoil with an acrid black substance on it. I immediately try to wake the man up, telling him he has to leave.   
He doesn't respond but is clearly breathing. So instead, I opt to call the cops.  


I return to the desk, in form housekeeping and call the police on the non-emergency line.   
Now, dear readers I would like to make one more thing apparent. We are probably the most visited hotel in the town, which means we have the most tourists, travelers, locals. You would think the city would want to keep their homeless population away, and to assist when needed. But no, dear readers. Ten minutes passed, Twenty, Thirty. A near full forty minutes has passed. I'm infuriated, not only because the police clearly have no want to work- but also because the House keeping has been telling me to ""Go Deal with it"" as if it were my job. My dear readers, it is not.   


But I, frustrated with the police, frustrated with my co-worker, frustrated with myself for not being able to 'Deal with it' decide to break protocol. I decide to 'Deal with it."" I put on my mask, my ski cap, and my thick winter jacket, padding myself in case the man has any sharp objects and proceed up the elevator. I'm fuming, I once lifted my stepfather's truck and turned it on its side when I was this mad when I was a teenager. I need to control myself; I need to breath. I managed to contain it, if only a little, and step out of the elevator.   


The man is still there, he hasn't moved. And thankfully no one else on the floor has woken. I bring my hands together in a mighty thunderclap that rattles the hallway, the very earth itself could have split open from the noise it created, numbing my hands in the process. This wakes the man- startled by the sudden sound probably akin to a gunshot in his waking mind.  


Drugged Up Homeless man: DUHM  
Me - Me.  


DUHM: ""Oh shit, oh. I can't believe I fell asle-""  
Me: ""Yea, no. You need to leave. Immediately.""  
DUHM: ""Oh- ye- ye fuck, can't believe I fell asleep. Shit.""   
He begins collecting his things, grabbing his phone and charger, reaching for the tinfoil and lighter.  
Me: ""Yea, get your stuff and let'-""

Readers, he lifted the Aluminum up, and began lighting his lighter. He was going to smoke whatever was on that piece of foil. In front of me, I lost that small semblance of control I managed to muster.   
I lost control of myself, with a great shove the man hit the wall like a sack of potatoes thrown by a trebuchet. He crumpled to the ground as I shouted at him, loud enough to wake the dead, fury and rage in my voice.   


Me: ""DO YOU THINK THIS IS A FUCKING JOKE!?""  
Readers, it's at this point that my blood is boiling, so I will try to be accurate- but I was seeing red.  
Me: ""WHO LET YOU IN? TELL ME.""  
DUHM: ""If I tell you can I come back""  
Me: ""NO, IF I SEE YOU AGAIN, I'LL BEAT YOU WITH A BAT.""  
DUMH: ""Why does everyone go for the bat? Why don't you just fight me with your fist, so there's nothing in it for me?""   
Me: ""Nothing, no Quater will be given.""   
DUHM: ""You're lucky."" he gets in my face as he says this, as if I couldn't rip him in half.  
He's standing back up, wobbly- But standing. I call the elevator and keep an eye on him. It opens its doors and I motion him in. He enters but stops at the entrance and speaks.  
DUHM: ""You don't want to get in here with m-""  
I shove him again, harder than the first time, he hits the back of the elevator.  
Me: ""I USED TO THROW REFRIDGERATORS, YOU DON'T SCARE ME.""  
I enter the elevator, never turning my back to him as I press the button from the lobby, stepping out first and watching him as he begins walking out the side door, pulling out a phone, probably calling whoever let him in the previous night.  


The cops arrived three hours after the phone call, an hour after I had left.

I was shaken, I haven't lost control of myself like that since I was in middle school. I don't understand how these people who need to rely on hospitality can spit in the face of it. Pissing in corners and leaving messes. If they wanted someplace warm to stay, they shouldn't leave any trace the had been there at all, yet they're so fucking stupid that they try to pick fights, piss in corners and leave drugs behind. Dear readers, I think if I saw this man again- I would not be able to hold back from mauling him, I'm going to be quite honest here. He should not return to this property if he values his life as it is",108,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF0C6F10>
550,My Precious Angel Would Never,"It's been a slow night. My biggest stressors being whether or not I should go get more water bottles to refill the fridge tonight, and how many episodes on hulu i can watch until shift ends....  


Till somebody calls 911 (emergency number) from their room. It routes to the front desk to alert me that it's been called, and I immediately call the room. Someone answers, and I hear indistinguishable voices in the background yelling, but no response on the phone, so I haul off to go to the room while dialing emergency on the way (phone off the hook, yelling in the background, no response... yeah that could be really bad!)  


Get to the room, it's a bunch of 12 yr olds. Mum and dad have left them for a few minutes to go to the nearby store. (there's a local sports game tomorrow, there are a lot of kids on the team here tonight)  


Nobody called emergency services? I'm sorry, is mum here?? where's dad?? Nobody touched the phone??  


This reeks of a stupid little kid prank... but I gotta cover my bases.  


I get back to the front desk, and dad is down there on his mobile, and he's FURIOUS AT ME for accusing his kids of dialing emergency.   
.... Bruh. You left a bunch of preteen boys alone... I can't fake the call that got sent from that room.   


(would have been an update, but it happened before I even finished typing this post... mum and dad just marched all the kids back down to go out to the car WITH THEM, so I guess even if I'm 'full of it', they believed me enough not to leave their little fuck trophies alone in the room again.)",63,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF0C6D30>
551,Food deliveries…,"It’s been a decently pleasant Saturday evening at my long term property. Not many arrivals and the guests aren’t being needy. So I thought it’d be a great time to sit down and eat my dinner. 1/3 of the way through my ‘jangles 3 piece I hear a noise at the desk. I pop up, mouth still full of food, to see who’s up there. 

“Oh I’m just delivering some food. I’ve already texted the customer and am leaving a picture of the food here on the counter.” 

Ok cool. So am I now responsible for this persons food? 

*a little flustered “uh.. no I’m going to wait for them to get here”

That’s not what it sounded like a second ago, but I told her ok thanks and headed back to my now mostly cold food. Since I was going to have to reheat it now anyways I decided to hang around the back office area just out of sight in case she needed me/to watch and see if she just left the food there and walked out. She actually stayed until the guest arrived a few minutes later and then left. 

This isn’t that great of a story but I’m sure something similar has happened to most if not all of us.

My second job ever (20ish years ago) was delivering Chinese food. Mostly houses but TONS of hotel rooms and dorm deliveries as well. I would have NEVER considered leaving a customers food at the front desk unless the customer requested that or it was the policy of the place. It’s been a while but I don’t remember it ever actually happening. My job was to deliver them their food (and hopefully get that tip money). Delivering it almost to the guest wasn’t to the guest. - And now on the flip side, I’ve got a lot of other things I (could possibly) need to do, and don’t necessarily have the time to babysit someone’s food until the guest arrives to pick it up. 

I understand we’ve got the pandemic going on and deliveries are a bit different now. And we do accept guest mail/packages and this is similar (but not quite). And with most of the deliverers being from a web app and not the actual restaurants they’re seeing the tip before they actually deliver the food so no incentive to do good service.

So, all you desk clerks; are you ok with being a third party to a food delivery? Do you refuse to do it? Does your hotel have special policies in place? Guests that frequent this subreddit; would you rather the delivery person bring it to your room? Leave it on the ground outside your door or leave at the front desk?",31,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF0C6A90>
552,You're Not As Slick As You Think You Are,"I don't often post, but today I have the story of ""The Local and the Third Party Booking: A Conflux of Idiots.""

A little background: Check in at our hotel is 3pm. If rooms are ready, we will check people in before then, but we have a hard rule that if they want to check in before 7am, that counts as a stay for the previous night and they have to check out by noon that day (or at least 2pm for a courtesy late checkout.)

My night auditor got two calls last night between 3 and 4 in the morning, one from a man, one from a woman. Both calls asked if someone could check in at 4am. The NA answered both that they could, but the stay would still be considered a stay for January 7th and the person would have to check out by noon that morning.

Lo and behold, at 4am, a man showed up wanting to check in. He had a local address and a reservation for January 8th, booked through Farceline.

My NA again explained he could check in at 4, but it would count as a stay for the 7th, so he would have to check out at noon. If he wanted to stay until noon January 9th, he would either have to leave and come back at 3pm to check in or pay for a separate night on his own CC at the rack rate. (aka, you're not adding 11 extra hours and a second buffet breakfast for each person in your room for free, buddy.)

He tried pulling ""I know that's not how things work. I used to work here; I know you can check me in now until the 9th."" My NA didn't budge that he would have to check out at noon, bless her, and he chose to check in anyway instead of coming back at 3 (Again, he was a local - there was no reason he couldn't go home and come back for the night he actually booked for.)

She told me about all this, and I looked at the name, and it wasn't one I recognized as ever working here, and I've been at this hotel since 2007. It was further confirmed that he was lying about it when he came down later that morning to ask me if he had to check out at noon, and neither I nor my breakfast hostess nor my housekeeping supervisor (who have both been here a little longer than I have) recognized him, and he was way too young to have been here *before* 2007. He was just lying to try to bully the NA into giving him what basically amounted to a free night.

I told him I could extend him a late checkout to 2, but, yes, he would have to check out today as a 4am check in would be a check in for the night of the 7th, not the 8th. 

""Do I have to call Farceline to get a half-day stay refunded to me then?""

""That's between you and Farceline, sir.""

Thankfully, he didn't pushback or argue over the check out and went back to his room.

Predictably, I got the expected call from Farceline, and I explained to the agent that, yes, the guest had used his reservation, that he had it explained to him that check in was 3pm and if he wanted to check in at 4am he would have to check out that same day and he *chose* to check in anyway and the hotel would not be approving any refunds.

After 2, housekeeping reported he'd left, and I thought that was the end of it.

*Y'allll*, just before 4 today, I got another call from Farceline about this chucklehead. This time, he told them he made the reservation for the wrong date and hadn't even used it. I told the agent, ""I already had a call about him this morning from you guys,"" and I reiterated the entire thing again, ending with, ""He's *lying* to you; he used the reservation already. Didn't the first guy leave any notes on the ticket?"" (The answer is no, no he didn't.)

I refused the refund again, and hopefully the second guy did leave notes if the ""guest"" contacts Farceline again. I'm going to warn the incoming shift about it, though, as I'm not holding my breath.",21,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF0C6970>
553,All I need is an ID,"The night is quiet, and I am standing at the desk, twiddling my thumbs waiting for someone to show up, so I can roll audit.

Me- “Welcome in, happy to help. Can I just take a peek at your ID?”

“You gave my my key yesterday, I just need the f—king key” (I wasn’t the one who checked her in, I went back and checked. I have no idea what stick was up her butt)

Me - “uh, alright. Well, I see a bunch of people every day, and I can’t place you, sorry. I just need to see you ID for security purposes. I’m sure you understand”

“Listen you fat f—k, just give me the key!”

554,I cant help you,"I come into work and the mid shift tells me a guest wants to be checked out of his room early. He did a echeck in but cant make it due to an emergency. 

I do sympathize with it in all but due to him already doing an echeck in there is nothing i can no longer do. I can check him out of the room but he will still be charged. 

Hes been  told several times to contact the gm in the morning but still wants to go back and forth with me. Hahahaha 

Then says hes a front desk manager and that they take care of their employees. Ok??? And then??? 


Im over here just thinking... ok if youre the so called fom then you of all people should know once youve checked into a room youre still getting charged for it. If i was to check you out of the room it will still post charges during audit. You should know that after youve checked into a room it cannot be canceled. You aught to know that its hotel policy. Fucking idiot. 

And then trying to tell me youre going to cancel your card after youve already checked into the room. Its already authorized dumb ass. It finalizes when i post charges. 

I swear this world has made more idiots day by day. 

I think hes thinking he can pull a fast one on me. Ive been doing my job long enough to know how audit works. 

Tonight is literally my last night. I dont give 2 fucks right now. Right now im just laughing my ass off. Blah blah blah im a fom. Then you should know the hotels policies and procedures dumb ass. Quit trying to think your in the right and think soemthing is going to get done for you at 11 at night. Call the gm in the morning.

555,The beach ball that may or may not be haunted,"Most people here seem to get situations caused by human selfishness, stupidity, or just plain bad luck. And while I've had my small share of those, here's something that's a different kind of silly. As in, creepypasta silly.

The hotel I work at has an indoor pool area. What's something that is often seen near a pool? One of those generic beach balls with three white stripes and three other colors, red, blue, and yellow I think, between them. You've seen millions of them. I also work the evening shift until midnight. Well, one night in the middle of summer, I close the pool area and one of these balls is just sitting on one of those white, plastic pool chairs. I don't think much of it and lock the room. Figure that whatever guest left it there will either pick it up the next day, let me know about it so I can unlock the room for them to get it, or some other guest will claim it.

A few days pass. It's still there. Nobody, guest or staff, has bothered to move it. It isn't until after maybe a week or so that this ball, or another ball just like it, is moved to the lobby and left on one of the couches. Probably worth noting that this is a family-owned hotel. Decent size with a few floors, but it's in a small town that isn't exactly a primary location and the management isn't the strictest. I guess, like me, they were just waiting for someone, anyone, to claim it. But it never happened. So there, for a night or two, that beach ball stayed on the couch. Until, one night, the auditor who comes in at the end of my shift points out that it's been moved from one couch to another. This began the stupid gag between us that the ball was haunted and moving by itself when no one was looking.

Another day or two later, the ball has been moved again. Now, it's in a little break room beside the front desk. Neither I nor the auditor saw it move, so we just kept the joke going. I later left it under the front desk for the auditor to see, he has a mild chuckle, and we carry on. Some time later, the ball is finally gone.

One night, not long later, when my shift is over and I head home, guess what I see in the front yard of my house as I pull in? I found it amusing that an identical beach ball just happened to pop out of nowhere right after the other went missing, but it was certainly odd. Now, it was cold out and I was tired, so I didn't bother with it and just headed in. Forgot about it the next morning when I woke up, noticed it again when I pulled out, forgot about it until I came back, it's cold and I'm tired, etc. for a couple more nights until, once again, it's gone. I asked my brother if he knew anything about that ball and he said he tossed it into one of the neighbors' yards. Alrighty then.

End of story, right?

A few months pass. The ball is completely out of my head and I haven't spared it a thought since. It's early November, the previous auditor has been gone for a few weeks and taking a better paying job, and I just ended my shift for the new auditor to take over. I head to my car, unlock it, open the door and... there a beach ball sits in the driver seat. Exactly the same as the others. One that I know for a fact that I didn't leave there in the car. I looked around thinking I had accidentally opened the wrong car, but nope. This is the right car. Even weirder, I didn't notice anything else out of place. I just saw the ball.

Okay. What the fuck?

I headed back into the building and made a note to let the manager know that someone might have opened my car and put their beach ball in there. I figure the parking lot cameras might pick something up, but I'm not 100% sure since my car is surrounded by other cars. When I got back in my car and pushed it to the passenger seat, I then realized that not only was there a regular beach ball, but a small Disney's Frozen ball on the floor. Okay then. And no, my manager found nothing from fast-forwarding over the footage due to other cars blocking my own and I'm not gonna bother him to comb over seven hours of footage for something this inconsequential.

Now, I'm always conscious to lock my car when I leave it, but I understand it's possible that I might forget one night. I also figure that MAYBE someone mistakenly tossed it into someone else's car. I don't know what the odds are that these two things might happen on the same night nor do I know what the odds are that someone would break into my car solely to toss a couple of beach balls in there. But I really have no explanation besides either those or haunted beach balls.

Since then, those two beach balls have been sitting in the back of my car. I have not moved them and I have no answers how they got there to begin with, but then again, maybe it makes a better story that my manager didn't find anything.

556,The Ultimatum: The Update,"So I put up [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheFrontDesk/comments/ry3due/the_ultimatum/) about my difficulties at work less than 24 hours ago. And boy howdy, do I have some updates:

1. The manager crumpled my notes in front of me, then told me to e-mail my two weeks notice.
2. He apparently then proceeded to tell every employee on-site that I had turned in my two weeks' notice, even though I still haven't sent the e-mail. Source: my former AGM asked me about it via text, having heard it from a front desk associate, who heard it from the GM.
3. I just discovered that one of my co-workers tested positive for COVID on Monday and has been working for the entire week with my GM's blessing. He works front desk. Source: Said co-worker confirmed this.

So yeah. I'm going to go back and get my belongings, then wish him the best of luck. Two weeks' notice is a courtesy that is NOT worth risking my health to extend.",112,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF0C64F0>
557,Unreliable Employee,"Update:  She did show up.  Never even read my message, which made me doubt she would, but I got some sleep.

As I’m sure is the case in most businesses right now, my hotel has had a pretty challenging staffing situation the last year and a half.  I started here three years ago, and inherited a front desk crew of amazing veterans.  Since the pandemic began, we’ve seen a major increase in long-term and government-assisted stays.

This resulted in a marked decline in the happiness of our staff, as long-term guests tend to be more difficult.  As a result, my veteran crew is gone.  I now have two rather new employees, and two in training who just started.  The desk is staffed by myself (AGM) 6-8 shifts per week, the GM 2-3 times per week, and the executive housekeeper 2-3 times per week.  As if things weren’t already bad enough, one of those rather new front desk agents is extremely unreliable.  She has missed at least one shift every single schedule in the last two months.  Many times she failed to give proper notice.

This story is one of those times, last weekend.  I had just worked a 7-3 while training a brand new employee, and she was to be my PM.  15 minutes before her shift, she texted that she was in the ER and wouldn’t be able to make it.  My staff is stretched so thin, there was literally no one I could call.  So I worked yet another double.  I texted back saying I expected a doctor’s note for her next shift.  Guess what she didn’t bring?

And here we are in the present.  I am scheduled 7 am - 10 pm today, and 7 am tomorrow.  She is scheduled to be my night auditor.  I texted at 3 pm to confirm she’d show at 10 pm.  She hasn’t answered yet.  My full-time auditor just texted to let me know that due to the weather we are experiencing, the last taxi just closed down, so she cannot be on standby anymore.

So if my unreliable employee doesn’t show tonight…then I’ll be at work 24-32 hours straight.

I haven’t been able to fire her due to being so short-staffed already.  But if she does that to me tonight, I’ve decided I don’t care anymore, I’ll fire her immediately.

Wish me luck!",70,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF0C63D0>
558,How to stand up for yourself/be firm?,"Im just an intern of 1 months in this hotel and I dont know what to do when the guest lost their sh*t. 

Ex: Room is not ready. Their upsetness is justified but I wish I could be more firm and confident instead of being like:

“Im really sorry sir. I understand. The housekeeping told me its another 10 minutes”

And they lost their sh*t again. 

Another guest took a video/picture of me when theyre angry and I cant even stand up for myself because I scared of creating bigger issue. Honestly, how do you do this?

559,Saw one in real life!!!,"Not front desk. Just a lurker on this sub and a hotel guest several times a year. 

I was at a fairly nice resort in a major southwest city this week for a work conference. A group of us were hanging out in the lobby one evening about 8pm. 

I see three young adults, maybe still teens come in, not at all dressed like most guests at this place would be. The one girls tried to rent a room with no ID using a pre-paid credit card. They spent several minutes trying to convince the front desk to rent them a room before they left. 

So with one ear I’m trying to pay attention to this work conversation but with my other ear I’m listening and thinking: this is just like they talk about on r/TalesFromTheFrontDesk!!!!",8,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CF0C6160>

561,Little girl asks for help,"I was working the PM shift last night and about 2 hours in I see a little girl (maybe 10-11) leaving with who I assume is her mother.  I had been working the PM shift the past 3 nights and has seen them walk through the lobby multiple times.  But this time the little girl starts to walk past and then stops and looks at me.  She was all bundled for the snowy weather with the hood from her jacket up and a mask on so I couldn't see much of her, just her eyes. 

I didn't notice at first she was crying and thought she was stopping to check to see when the pool was open.  But she didn't say anything. So the conversation roughly goes like this:

Me: are you ok? *glances at mom who is like 10 yards away right at the lobby doors*

Girl shakes her head no

Me: do you need help? *again I look at the mom who won't say a word*

Girl nods and now I can tell she is crying.  

Me:  what do you need help with?

Girl shrugs but won't look at her mom.

Me: do you want to write it down for me?

Girl nods and I'm about to hand her a piece of paper paper a pen when the mom says ""she'll tell you all kinds of things""  then walks out of the lobby to the parking lot.  The girl then says ""she said she's going to kill me.""  I'm internally panicking as my heart is breaking for this girl right now.  

I was about to tell her to come into the back office with me so we can figure out what to do when she says her grandma is in a room on the third floor.  I asked her if she felt safe with her grandma and she said yes.  So I told her to go on up.  

I consulted with a co-worker and we decided to call 911 for a wellness check.  But I decided to call up to the grandma first to make sure the girl got up there ok.  The grandma answered the phone and said ""everything's is fine"" and something like ""the girl has an attitude problem and needs to learn.""  Which... did not make me feel better.   So I called for the wellness check.  Explained everything to the dispatcher, gave my name for documentation but asked the police to say it was anonymous because I did not want drama in the lobby.  They were up in the room for maybe 10-12 minutes and said everything was ok before they left.  But I still felt off about everything.  

A couple hours later the grandma called down and canceled her room cleaning for the next day which has thrown my paranoia into overdrive.  Her reservation is until sometime in February so I asked everyone just to keep an eye out.

I know that some kids are brats and some parents say things they don't mean out of exasperation, but I feel like... you don't just stand in front of a stranger crying asking for help if you trust and feel safe with your mother, ya know?  


I just can't stop thinking about it. Hoping I did everything I could.  But also feel like I didn't do enough.   The only thing I wish I would have done different is call something like CPS but it didn't occur to me at the time.  

If anyone has some advice or has dealt with something similar within a hotel setting I would greatly appreciate to hear from you.


Edit: thanks for the validation everyone.   I'm giving CPS a call and will update when I know something.

Edit 2:  I really don't have a satisfying update.   They basically took down what little info I had and said to keep an eye on things.  The girl isn't actually staying there, but if I see her again and anything looks off to call them again.  With having the first issue documented it will necessitate a visit to investigate.  I had a coworker tell me she saw her leave after breakfast and hadn't been back.  And I made the call way after that (but I didn't know about her leaving till right before I made the call).  So for now I'll just be extra vigilante and document anything I see and call back if/when necessary and just hope all my coworkers in all departments keep an eye out too.",36,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEF5C940>
562,Professors son,"So I got this very rude email from this professor (he called himself that) that his son stayed with us and was kicked out for no reason and if he didn’t get a refund he would contact and make a dispute with PayPal. Found out that his son got drunk while writing a thesis (a questionable choice) and ordered food. Came down to reception couldn’t find it so asked my colleague who said she hadn’t received anything and to maybe check with the app. He then goes back to the room and calls reception to complain that we didn’t believe him that he ordered?? And proceeds to argue and be abusive to my colleague about it. My HM wasn’t impressed so called him the next day and he apologised and agreed ti leave but to “not tell his dad”. Now we’re dealing with grumpy dad who wants his refund because his “angel child” got kicked out for “no reason” lol 😂

Edit: turns out HM was processing the refund already before his snarky email and he knew but we were taking too long? Even though it’s a third party not us anyways. She refunded him because she just wanted the son to leave without incident",62,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEF5C310>
563,The Ultimatum,"I have basically been doing the supervisor job at my workplace for months without receiving the promotion to go with it. No pay raise (the GM keeps saying 'we'll try to get around to doing your 90 day review'), no promotion (into a position that is vacant), no nothing. I fix other departments' screw-ups, I put away heavy shipments (despite my disability), I've managed to bring our supply closet back to usability (and in the process found several items thought lost), I've sorted out the most difficult guest issues...I'm not *technically* in charge at the front desk, but for all practical purposes I am.

Today's shift started with me having to ***break up a fight*** between front desk and a guest, because both of them were shouting each other down and going after each other. When a guest yells at an employee, that's unfortunate, but it happens. When an employee yells at a guest, that's absolutely unacceptable. I literally reached the point where I had to raise my voice to be heard among both of them and tell the employee to ***stop interacting with the guest so I can help them***. (Fortunately, she listened.) The guest was absolutely livid, but I managed to get her calmed down, gave her my best contrite apology, made sure that the communication issues were sorted out, and got her checked in. She's in a room right now. She still wants to talk to my GM (understandably), and she still wants compensation for how she was treated (normally I'd say no, but considering what I saw, understandably), but she was at least happy with how I handled the situation.

I make less than a new McDonald's employee. And I don't mean a manager, I mean 'do you want fries with that'.

I have typed up two notes to give to my manager when he comes in today.

1: ""I hereby accept the promotion to the position of Front Desk Supervisor as of Sunday, January 9th 2022 with an accompanying pay increase to \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ / hour and responsibilities to be further discussed between myself and my general manager.""

2: ""I hereby present my two weeks' notice with the intent to end my tenure at <my hotel>. My last day of work will be the night of Thursday, January 21st. I am willing to discuss the reasoning for my decision if management indicates an interest in doing so.""

I am going to hand them to him and tell him, ""I need you to sign one of these notes. I will then take it to the back, make a copy for you, and retain a copy for myself. The other one, I will take to the front and destroy on-camera.""

He absolutely cannot function without me. (I know, because he's told me so many times.) Let's see how serious he is, or if - as I suspect - there is simply no opportunity for me here.",93,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEF5CD60>
564,"""Shut Your Gay Ass Up""","I almost wanto to post this on the Anti-work subreddit. I'm so confused, and offended. There's this guy who stays here pretty regularly, and he came in, so I said, ""Hey,"" he didn't respond, so I said, ""Welcome back,"" and here's probably my mistake... I was confused, so I just said, ""Okay,"" loud enough for him to hear me, because I was genuinely offended. I'm probably the asshole in this situation, but I'm tired of being polite to people who don't have the courtesy to return it back with at least a, ""Hello.""

This is where things take a turn. This guy, as he's walking down the hall tells me to ""shut [my] gay ass up."" What the fuck? I am gay, but there's no need for that. Sure, should I have not replied to his silence with, ""Okay,""? Nah, but to be a homophobic asshole about it? 

I'm so ready to quit here. I love my boss in everything but her management style, but I'm done working with the public.

UPDATE: This isn't the update y'all are going to want, and not the update I'd hoped for. My boss told me to ""treat these people like they're illiterate,"" which comes off pretty fucking racist in this area. The only bright side of it is that she told me that I was allowed to curse people out in Russian, which despite my username, I am not fluent in; and it really doesn't make sense to curse someone out in a language they can't understand.",65,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEF5C7C0>
565,I made a guest apologize,"A few years ago, I was working at a larger property (200+ rooms)  and this hotel had a specific HSKP policy.  When a room becomes vacant, the HSKP manager or supervisor will check the room first to make sure there is no damage or anything left behind before it is cleaned.

One day a guest checked out and returned to the hotel claiming that she was missing a piece of jewelry.  I called the HSKP supervisor and she came to the FD.  She confirmed that she had checked the room and it hadn't been cleaned yet, but nothing was left behind.  Guest insisted on going upstairs and since no one was cleaning the room, the supervisor took her up. Nothing was in the room- just like she said.  The supervisor ""Martha"" brought the guest back to the FD.  The guest looked right at me and said ""Well, SOMEONE must have taken it"" She said that while Martha was standing right next to her and already had explained that she was the only person who had been in the room.  She basically accused Martha of theft in her presence.  I tell guest that since she confirmed nothing was left behind there was nothing the hotel could do but I would take her info in case it was found in a public area, like the bar or parking lot.  Guest leaves in a huff.

A few hours later, her husband calls and says that they found the piece of jewelry- it was in her pants pocket.  I say that is great but now I'm going to transfer you over to Martha so you can tell her and explain/apologize for what happened.  Martha came back after the call and said the husband did apologize for his wife's behavior.  They never stayed with us again and for that I am grateful.",35,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEF5C700>
566,Damn Jackie I Can't Control The Weather,"Hello workers and lurkers, after a brief covid-related hiatus (I'm okay now), I'm back at work. And I wouldn't be writing this if guests weren't back on their bullshit!

So to set the scene, some of you have probably heard about the huge snowstorm affecting western new york currently. As I look out the window from the front desk I get to watch the cars in our lot get snowed in in real time! Wow! I'm most definitely getting snowed in here if that's any indication on how bad it is.

But anyways, as most people from heavy snow-affected areas know, cars don't go in corners against buildings unless you wanna spend an hour to shovel it out. Cue the true stars of this story, Male Dumbass, and Female Dumbass (Mr and Mrs DA for short). Mr and Mrs DA, who were apparently born and raised in the area parked their small vehicle in one of the dreaded corners and mother nature done buried it under a few feet of snow. When I clocked in today they were already in a heated conversation with our front office manager about getting a plow for the parking lot, but to their credit the lot in general DID need to be cleared. My manager said she'd contact the company and they went back to their room to watch as the outdoor conditions worsened.

No less than an hour later, everyone's favorite third party site calls on behalf of the Dumbasses about the plows taking too long to get here. I pawn it off to my lovely manager and shake my head at the fact they called the third party to complain.

A little while later my manager calls me from her office. ""Anarchy, they wanted a refund, because they're snowed in. I told Suxpedia it's a natural disaster like, no!""

I couldn't hold my laughter in. We banter back and forth for a bit about experiencing the stupidest sides of humanity in this industry and I relay the info to my coworker.

But for people supposedly raised in these parts, they should know that we can't control the weather and not to park in corners during snowstorms! I've heard of Mouse Park patrons requesting a refund over a bit of rain but I never thought I'd experience someone ask for a refund because the area they grew up in is experiencing it's yearly snowmageddon. You gotta love customer service!

Update edit: Mr Dumbass came down to buy some snacks and spent like 5 minutes laying into me calling the hotel a ""complete shit hole"" and calling myself and the rest of the staff ""fucking liars"" and told me I'm ""full of bullshit"" when describing the hazardous road conditions I experienced on my drive in today. Thankfully some of the semi-truck drivers we house were down in the lobby waiting for their ride back to the terminal and stepped in to back me up, but shit man, like that's uncalled for. My coworker let our owner know as well and he's kicking them out tomorrow when the snow clears up enough to do so. ",55,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEF5CD90>
567,How's your Thursday going?,"Earlier I had 4 entitled pricks come walk in and inquire about a room.  None of them had on any face masks so I asked them to put on their masks since it is required by state law.  I told them the price and they said they would check online.  They proceed to sit in the lobby and charge their phones and talking.  One decides to use the restroom and wash his hair and is fixing his hair in the lobby.  I remind them 2-3 additional times about wearing face masks, some were not wearing face masks.

This goes on for about 10 minutes so at this point they're just hanging out.  I ask them to leave because they were not compiling with the mask law.  They start saying they will wear masks, but at this point I know it's just a bunch of BS so I stick to my guns and tell them to leave.  They start getting lippy so I tell them leave or police will be called.  One of them starts stating his rights and to contact the police.

I am on hold with the non-emergency line for several minutes while they convince the cocky bastard to leave.  Cocky guy says something to me in their foreign language and him and his buddies are all laughing as they walk out.  They are in their car so I when finally connected to the operator I tell them I no longer need the police.  A couple of minutes go by and cocky guy comes back in asking where the police are at, so I call the police again and get connected almost immediately.  I request for an officer to come out, but by the time the police get here they're gone.  I make my apologies to the police and think that's it.  Nope.

About an hour later they drive up to the entrance and I can see them from the corner of my eyes.  They're yelling where's the police at and laughing.  I almost got in my car to chase them down and run them over.

WTF is wrong with entitled little shits coming out of the wood work.  I hope your Thursday is faring better.

Edit: 3:26pm, One of them stopped by to pay another visit.  Came in and yelled, ""Amigo, que pasa?"" and flipped me off.  They're not even Hispanic, nor am I.  At this point it's getting funny. ",9,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEF5CDC0>

569,An Amusing Tale for Everyone,"I've posted in here before airing grievances with my AGM but in case you don't remember me (I've only posted a tale once before), here's some background info on my property:  I work for a motel in the middle of the Land of Enchantment but we don't take regular customers--we serve as a dormitory for railroad employees. This is a 157 room property and we average about 140 check-ins a day. (The way the dorm is set up is the rails check in and stay on average for 11-13 hours to sleep and rest, and then they check-out to go back to work.) The property is split into two buildings since one building used to be a regular motel and our company bought it out years ago. The old building is known as the East Wing and the newer building is the West Wing. We run 24/7. I'm the night auditor from Tuesday to Saturday.

So on to the tale!

Picture this, suburban Land of Enchantment, 2016. It's 2 or 3 in the morning, I get a call from a guy staying in the East Wing. We'll call him Robert.

Me: Front desk.

Robert: Hey, OP, it's Robert in 6215. I just stepped outside and there's a rattlesnake by the stairwell. Do y'all have a shovel or something so I can go kill it?

Me: Uhhh, we don't have a shovel, but even if we did, letting a railroader confront a dangerous animal is a liability situation so let me call somebody that can do it for you.

Robert: Darn, okay, I'll just go back to my room.

Seeing as it was the middle of the night, the only people I could think of to call was the regular police station. So that's what I did. They showed up, I pointed them to the direction of the East Wing, and the snake was taken care of.

Since they were the police, their car lights were going off and some railroaders had come in to check in and they were like, ""Hey, what's going on out there? What happened?""

Me: Oh, there was just a rattlesnake over in the East Wing. Everything's fine now though.

One of them: You called the popo on a SNAKE?

Me: Who else do you call at 3am? The Ghostbusters?!

To this day, when Robert checks in I greet him as the Snakeslayer. He takes it in good stride.",32,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEF5C760>

571,I'm in a dilemma. can you help?,"I quit. I have given my 2 weeks and had extended it another 2 weeks. It's getting to the point I loath coming into work. I am a night auditor. The end of that month is coming up and I was supposed to train a new night audit to take my place. Unfortunately he slipped and fell on his driveway and doesn't know if he will ever work again. 

This leads me to the conversation I had this morning with my GM. He wants me to hold off my last day until I find someone. I told him I would think about it seeing that I have another job that I work part time and was planning on moving to full time once I left this place. 

It takes an hour to drive one way to this location and I make 15$ an hour. Not to mention I work over 50 hours a week. One coworker works more then that and technically it's not her job to work at the desk. She is an executive assistant to our GM. Another co worker works about as much as I do but somehow he finds the time to take a vacation at the end of this month. Not to mention is sick currently and we aren't sure if it isn't *THE* disease, or just a cold. And the other front desk person works part time and is in all honesty useless. I spend my audit time fixing his mistakes. And he is a morning front desk person. ( This could be the fact I'm tired and working 64 hours combined this week and that's the low end of what I've been working. There are weeks it's been as high as 105 hours) 

Naturally I'm pissed and spent the who time I was supposed to be driving cursing the cruel god that found this funny. Panicking about never being able to leave the hell I created. Feeling sick myself but powerless to call in (who would work for me? No One) and just having an overall panic attack. (Or anxiety idk) because I want to go back to school. I already paid for my classes and books. Yes it's all online but I'm also taking 12 credit hours in 8 weeks. I don't know if I can work the hours I do and have any time to study. 

Then I though. ""How bad do these mofos need me?"" So here's what I need help with. I have 3 scenerios I could do. And I need to know what is the best

1) I ask for a raise of 20$ an hour and no more doubles. The lowest Ill go is 17$ an hour and I get 3 days off. The job listing will still be up and I reserve the right to walk out at anytime without warning. You knew I was leaving. If you have to work more hours GM. Then that's what you have to do. And I get my birthday off. No questions asked

2) I keep my original plan of leaving in a week and telling them this isn't my problem. I can work the week that the other person is supposed to be on vacation but that's about it. (I did say I could squeeze it in) 

3) RUN. RUN FAR AND RUN FAST. DAMN THE CONSEQUENCES.

So yeah that's where I'm at. I can't keep doing what I'm doing anymore. Is it extortion. You can argue that. But they have no problem extorting my labor to a breaking point. Yes I work 2 jobs. But one is supposed to be part time. And this sudden work spike for the full time job was supposed to be temporary until we found a front office manager. 

I'm very tired guys. I know I'm not the only one.

Edit: I'm pretty sure that whatever my other night auditor had  was passed down to me. I'm calling in and I'm not working anymore. I endured. I worked to my very core. And I about crashed my only means of transportation countless times. I asked my GMs executive assistant why my GM can't work the desk.

 And get this... He doesn't know how to check people in.

 No time to learn like the present. How do you manage a hotel for 15 years and NOT know how to check someone in?? Furthermore why did he tell me he could? In my original resignation extension he said he would but is too busy. I believed that. I'm not being taken advantage of anymore. I know that It may make the exec mad. And I do feel bad. But I'm not asking her to work it for me.",181,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEF5C100>

We had a longer conversation so it’s really unlikely she didn’t see. Brightness wasn’t low, made no effort to cover it up or anything. I had already forgotten. Like I said I was so high, there could’ve been an explosion and I wouldn’t have even flinched.

When she left, I turned around to my computer and saw CHEEKS. Full screen. MAX brightness. White ass. I was crying laughing, I don’t even remember how I responded.",12,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEF5C8B0>
573,(WOOOSH) The front desk was ambushed!,"*As usual, all person and property names are aliases in place of the actual names.*

I know night audit shifts tend to be frontloaded since the start of the shift is when the last of the arrivals usually check in, but this sure as hell felt like a coordinated attack on the hotel.

So I've just started my shift with three rooms still unsold when I get a call from James McGames asking about our rates for tonight. Okay, whatever...oh, they want *two* rooms, and for *two* nights. I give them rack rate, hoping that the higher rate for tomorrow ($70 tonight and tomorrow night is $110) turns them off...but nah, they go forward and declare their intent to come to the motel and walk in.

Then, as I'm doing another walk-in rental for another guest, the phone goes off. Local Fool inquires about their AC/heater unit's thermostat not working because it's starting to feel like a sauna in there. (It's only about 10-12 C tonight which is not too bad of a winter weather.) I tell them I'll get back to their problem once I'm done checking in guests...which turns out to be like, 3 or 4 guests in a row, including James from earlier; fortunately, our property management software makes it easy to copy and paste guest info into a new reservation.

Doing these three walk-in rentals means our inventory is now depleted, so I went to our online inventories to close them out since sometimes there are delays in our inventory chain (PM software <-> our chain's central res server <-> third-party/OTA sites) ...sadly, it appears I was not fast enough, because by the time I get back to the PM software, we're now at -1 inventory. I suuuuuuuuuure love having my overbooking-related trauma set off; I've only ever had one overbooking-related experience go well, the rest consist of disappointed guests at best and verbal attacks on average. Like get upset about it if you must but stop acting like it's entirely the fault of the front desk clerk on duty. Fortunately the res wasn't prepaid so I contacted the guest to let them know their res was cancelled free of charge,

Also a guest bought snacks, which means my start-of-shift cash tally is now incorrect because I also had to dispense change to the guest, all before I could count the cash. Obv there are worse problems, I just don't like having having an incorrect cash tally because it makes me seem unreliable with cash transactions.

Finally I get back to Local Fool and I deal with their AC issues by just shutting off the AC and offering to loan them one of the space heaters in the front office if they do need heat, but Local is quite understanding about me taking like half an hour to get back to them.

Bottom line, please be patient with hotel clerks, especially if it's late at night at a smaller property (fewer than 60 rooms) when it's likely the front desk clerk you're talking to is the only staff on duty. Be ready to expect delays if you try to check in during front desk shift change times (traditionally 3 PM and 11 PM). You're not the only hotel guest in the world and human cloning technology does not exist ~~yet~~.

Anyways, welcome to the Kuso Motel, no just because you're an Unobtainum Member doesn't mean you can physically assault the guests who were in front of you to cut in line. Actually we don't even *have* a snowflake member program like you say we have. Game over. Enter your initials: `DNR`",16,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEF5CB20>

Also pertinent- my shift ends at 11 pm.


About 10 pm, I decide to start mopping the floors again so they are spotless for the incoming NA. Ding goes the bell (ofc I had a busy sign up, but fuck us and anything else we may need to do). I greet the gentleman who is paying with points. No prob. Here is the convo between me and Entitled Schmuck:

Me: Would you like to use card or cash for incidentals?

ES: Incidentals? What are these? No one has asked me thid before. 

Me: it is our policy to collect $x as a deposit that you get back when you check out so long as nothing is damaged and you follow our no smoking policy

ES: I've stayed here before no one asked me.

Me: that notwithstanding, this is our policy and I'm telling you now that we require incidentals 

ES: where is this written?

Me: sir, it is policy.  You can speak with my manager in the morning  

ES: i was just in some other city in another state

Me: this isn't some other city in another state

ES: let me speak to your manager

Me: they aren't here, they'll be in tomorrow morning

Finally gives me the card 

10:30, I set off to finish mopping 


10:40, nearly done,  in walks someone

575,The Would Be Valet Theives,"So last night was wild, and I'm still processing it. It's nights like last that remind me why I so desperately want out of this industry, but alas, until I can find something that pays better, and isn't as customer facing, I'm stuck here for the moment as I need the healthcare. I've spent a decade in hospitality so I have a few stories to tell, but in my ten years I haven't experienced anything as coordinated as this. Last night was a full on blitz.

So I work overnight at the front desk of a large metropolitan hotel. Between covid and civil unrest over the past few years, occupancy has of course taken a nosedive, and it's also affected staffing levels. One former guest who left a review remarked that staff at our property seemed ""overtaxed and unenthusiastic,"" and frankly that assessment was spot on. At one point during the pandemic, I was doing about eight people's jobs for the price of one, but that's another matter entirely. Last night, we just had myself, a night porter, and two security guards. Normally I would also have a PBX operator and a proper guest services agent (I'm a supervisor, though effectively just a glorified GSA at this point), but budget cuts. Oh, and also we have an engineer on staff but he was not involved in this incident.

It all started when a very suspicious (see: methy) looking young woman came off the elevator with some bags in her arms, and mentioned that the guests in room ""5XX"" were very loud and sounded like they were fighting. This was at about 3 am. I thanked her for letting me know as she headed out, and called security on the radio that I had received a noise complaint regarding room ""5XX."" I typed room 5XX into my operating system, but curiously, no one was assigned to that room. Even more curious, there was only one room occupied on that floor. Just as I was about to call security to let them know it might have been the wrong room, I heard one security officer on the radio call the other to meet him down in our garage because he saw someone on the security cameras down there prowling around the cars. Now, we're valet only, and there should not have been anyone down in the garage at all. How they got down there was a mystery, unless the guest elevators had been unlocked to the garage, though normally that floor would be locked off to guests. Security quickly bolted for the elevator, and then it hit me that maybe the girl was trying to have me call security away to the fifth floor as a distraction so that whoever was down in the garage could use that opportunity as a smash and grab. After a thorough patrol of the garage, security did not find anyone down there, and were not sure where the person they saw went.

When security returned, I mentioned that there was no one listed on the fifth floor and that the noise complaint may have been a distraction. I had a weird gut feeling about the girl, and so he took a look at the cameras to see if we could get a good picture of her. Now all we needed to do was identify who she was, because she may have been in connection with someone trying to break into cars in our secured garage (there have been a lot of car break ins in garages in the area lately, as well as stolen vehicles. It's like Mad Max on the road in our city right now, we've got problems.). I looked at some rooms on the fourth and fifth floor that could have been hers, checked what time those rooms had checked in, and had security cross reference that on the cameras to see if any of the guests checking in at those times were her, but none were. Now was I sure she was even a guest?

Some time went by, and things were quiet, and then at about 4 am, a lot of things happened all at once, and very quickly. So quickly that parts of it feel like a blur to me, even now, and it was difficult keeping focus. First, my night porter had brought up a vehicle for a guest from valet who was on their way down. He left the keys for that guest at the desk with me, as he had to go down for a second car for another guest who also wanted their vehicle brought up. Right as he had pulled up, the woman who told me about the supposed noise complaint came back in from outside (notably empty handed, as her arms were full of bags earlier when she went out), and behind her, I saw two gentlemen, one that matched the description of the gentleman that security had seen on camera in the garage earlier. I called security and mentioned that she was coming back into the building and the guy was with her, but she was the only one to come inside. I stopped her, and asked her what her room number was just so I could note it about the noise complaint. She quickly muttered, ""oh, well, we were on the fourth floor but had to go to the fifth floor to get some ice and it sounded like they were just playing really loud music on the fifth floor."" She did not give me her room number and her story changed, just like that. She made a beeline for the elevator but before I could further prober her another guest came up to me and just started talking at me about wanting to check out and get a receipt which pulled my attention away, and I realized it was the second guest who wanted their vehicle brought up. I let them know my night porter had just brought up another vehicle and was going back down to get theirs now.

At that moment, several more things happened at once. I hear my night porter exclaim, slightly panicked, ""ALL THE VALET KEYS ARE GONE!"" over the radio. Security is running to the elevator and calling for backup. The first guest who called for his vehicle (whose keys I have) comes to grab his keys. I hand over his keys as my night porter comes in not sure what to do. He mentions that he saw the chains beating on the gate, as if someone were trying to open it manually, downstairs. I have him stand at the desk for a moment, grab my radio, and run into PBX to look at the camera, and someone is trying to drive a vehicle up the entrance ramp, but can't make the turn properly (it's a tight one-way corridor, they're trying to go backwards), and I hear security call to call the police.

I run back out to the desk, hit the panic button (it usually gets the police here faster), and call 911. I explain what's happening to the dispatcher with my radio still in my other hand, and my night porter right in front of me. The guests waiting for their car are looking confused, and another guest has come down hoping to check out, and needs a luggage cart, but is going to have to wait. I find myself relaying information between the dispatcher and security with the phone in one hand and radio in the other. I see police pull in up front, and a couple more police cars go by. I've told them where the entrance and exit to the garage are, and that's where I'm assuming they've gone. Security is down on the ramp and the suspects have ditched the cars since they could not get past the gate, and have retreated to the stairwell to use the emergency exits to run out of the building. The police catch and detain only one of them, while the other three (one of which was the woman who was the distraction) escape down the street. Since the guy they caught is not one that we have on video, and did not have keys on him, and was seen fleeing the building with the others, we got him on trespassing, but that's it. These guys had scouted everything out in advance, knew where everything was, and moved fast. This was coordinated and calculated. The only thing they could not get past were the gates. Somehow, they gained access to the back of the house, broke into the valet box, stole all the keys, and tried to steal the cars. I called my manager at home and told her what had happened, and security called the general manager. My manager (who is amazing) was flabbergasted, but thanked me for the heads up, and would follow up when she arrived.

After that, we found three sets of keys, and later, a fourth. Out of twelve total. Eight were still missing, and never found. We compared the keys we had to the valet list, and the second guest who wanted their car, who were present in the lobby for the entire ordeal, did have their keys, and were fortunately very understanding of the whole situation. Most guests were understanding, but any frustration about the situation is totally justified. I had one gentleman who was very upset, understandably, and I comped his entire stay. I believe we may have comped every room that was affected, but I wasn't here when all of that unfurled throughout the day. I believe the cars without keys had to be towed to dealerships of the guest's choosing to have new keys made, and all of this would be covered by the hotel's insurance. I still left the hotel in the morning feeling beat.

The real nugget? My GM is the least human person. He does not care for the health and safety of staff or guests, but that's another story entirely. All he cares about is the bottom dollar and appearances. Did he thank us for our suspicions, or our quick thinking to make sure that the vehicles themselves were secure, or that we caught the culprits on video, or that we were able to mobilize fast enough to get the police here while the attempted burglars were still actively burgling? Did he show empathy or gratitude that none of the actual cars were stolen? Nope. All he wanted to do was lay blame to someone, punish someone, and ask what we could have done differently. FUCK THIS MAN. There was nothing that could have been done differently. We reacted as swiftly and as safely as we could have in real time in a confusing situation. All protocols and procedures were followed. The keys that were stolen were locked up in a secure area. We did everything right. This was a coordinated attack by people who knew what they were doing, and nothing could have stopped it. And truthfully: Almost anyone can access the back of the house area in a hotel - any hotel - if they can access an emergency stairwell or service elevator. Once someone is in, they can go basically anywhere. And if there's any lesson I've learned from watching youtube videos from the Lockpicking Lawyer, it's that basically any lock can be broken or picked in seconds by someone who knows what they are doing and is determined to get in. Rather than praise us for our efforts to stop criminals in action, my GM was looking to punish us for this even happening in the first place. GM can pound sand. To his credit, I shouldn't have expected anything positive from him, as nearly all of my interactions with him, as well as other's interactions, have been largely negative. He responds to emails, reply all, typically in all caps with accusatory language, in the most unbecoming and unprofessional way that I've ever seen from a GM ever. But alas.

So there you go. We've upped our security measures today, the gates are remaining closed at all times, and keys have been moved to a more secure location. But it's still been a shit show.

&#x200B;

EDIT: GIRL! SHE CAME BACK TONIGHT! THE SHEER AUDACITY. She walked in, tried to hide her face, on her phone, toward the elevator, and I stopped her.

Me: ""You were here last night.""

Her: ""Uh, no, no I wasn't. Wasn't me. I just got into town. I'm just going up to my room.""

She continues to step toward the elevator.

Me: ""What is your room number?""

Her: ""6XX.""

Me: (Types the room number in. Miss.) ""Sorry, that room is unoccupied. What is your name.""

Her: ""Well, it's my friend's room, it's not under my name.""

Me: ""Sure, what's your friend's name?""

Her: ""Jaime.""

Me: (Types name. No hits.) ""Sorry, I don't have anyone registered under that name.""

Her: ""Maybe it's under her boyfriend's name, just, I'm on the phone with her, can I just go up?""

Me, sternly, firmly: ""No.""

Her: ""Well, can I just wait over here-"" Continues to walk toward the elevator.

Me: (Grabs radio) ""No, you can wait up front. Your friend can come down or call me from the room."" (She and I both know there is no friend, and there is no room.)

Her: \*Mutters incoherently.\* ""Okay, well, I'll just..."" And she turns and heads outside.

I call security as she's leaving. I mention it's the same girl, and describe her new outfit. Tonight, she's wearing a stolen red hoodie with the security ink tag still on, just under the hood. She's also got a little empty backpack with her slung over one shoulder, open. Security was out in seconds, and followed her outside. Ironically enough, a cop car happened to pull around right as she went to cross the street, she spotted it, and immediately bolted. The cop car decided that was a good reason to pursue her. Hilarity ensues!",29,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEF5C3A0>
576,Night Audit Training Gone Wrong,"I apologize for how long this post is.


Anyways, on with the story! This particular day I was training a new night auditor and all was swell. The restaurant/bar was busy that night but it all quieted down near midnight. At approximately 1:30 I receive a noise complaint from a guest stating that they are hearing, what sounds like, crying, vomiting, and slamming doors coming from their room. Great, I thought, this will give me a good opportunity to show my trainer what to do when we receive a noise complaint. I relay the information to our security, who has unfortunately been coming in to work drunk, and ask for them to knock on the door; we take noise complaints very seriously and don’t bother calling ahead of time since, well, they’re already awake.

Thinking this is over and done with, I return to my routine of watching phone until it is time to actually do the audit, we don’t start till 3 in the morning, but I hear security state that he is not receiving a response from the guest. Knowing him, I doubted that he even knocked and proceeded to inform him that we, myself and the trainee, will head up to take a look. We arrive and, due to the experience I’ve gained throughout my 8 months at this hotel, knock as loudly as my 5’8” 20 year old body can, and ask loudly if they can answer the door. I am met by silence, but upon closer inspection hear the shower running and no other shenanigans occurring. I tell the trainee and security and that it seems like they’ve quieted down and that if we receive another complaint we will come back up.

The three of us head back to the front desk and I, again, begin watching my phone intensely, waiting to start the audit. 15 minutes pass and we receive another noise complaint for the same room. As before myself, the trainee, and security guard head up and I, again, knock very loudly to no response. At this point my, spidey-senses if you will, begin tingling and I follow with “if you do not answer the door we will be forced to call emergency responders to ensure everything is alright.” Again, no response, which is a big red flag.
I call the front desk manager and state that we may need to call emergency services for this guest and he gives me the all clear to enter the room beforehand. I expected this and had already made a key and called for security to witness me enter the room as I have no clue what is happening and I am of the opposite sex of the guest.

I inform my trainee to stay at the desk as I don’t know how long this will take, and we, security and I, head up with the latch tool, to all those who have not worked in a hotel and only lurk, yes we have a tool to open the latches from outside the room. I again knock to no response. I unlock the door and am greeted by the latch, to which I then yell into the room “ma’am, can you please come to the door?” Nothing. At this point my spidey-senses are full throttle and am expecting the worst. We undo the latch and open the door. 

Oh no.

The moment I enter the room I glance over to the shower, which is still on, and see legs on the floor. I immediately yell at security to call for 911 and throw my jacket to the ground, security grabs his radio and says “Security to front desk, call 911.” I yell at him “No, grab your f****** phone and call the f****** police right now,” and I get to work. The guest is on their back, face up, in the shower with it still running, choking and wheezing; with what can only be described as semi-coagulated bloodied vomit on her and around the shower. I ask, very loudly, “Are you okay, ma’am?” To no response. I then ask “do you need help?” Very loudly and am greeted by, again, nothing. 

She’s unresponsive.

I shut off the shower and drop to my knee to check her pulse. Thank the stars, she’s still alive. I roll her into the recovery position and place my finger back on her carotid artery to maintain feeling of her pulse in case CPR is necessary. While keeping security out of the bathroom as to do my best to protect her privacy, I give him information to relay to the dispatcher.
Now the waiting game, which consisted of checking the person’s pulse and breathing while waiting for a professional to take over; and me trying to calm myself down as I was beginning to have a panic attack due to the time I was assaulted on shift a few months back. 

The police arrived at the room, with my trainee whom I promptly sent back down to the front desk as I didn’t want more people to be in this small room, and while one “tagged me out” as he phrased it, the other began searching the room. I joined him in the searching of the room where we found significantly more bloodied vomit as well as prescription medication, multiple empty wine bottles, and a loaded firearm. I began taking pictures of these items, and the room, for any potential legal purposes while we waited for an ambulance to arrive.

This took, and I’m not exaggerating, 30 minutes, and all we, the two police officers, security, and myself, could do was listen to this person struggle to breathe and choke. All the while praying that this person doesn’t pass away. The ambulance finally arrived and they were able to place her on their gurney and took off just as quickly as they had arrived. The police left with them, bringing the firearm with for safety purposes.

I called the front desk manager and informed him of all that transpired, and afterwards went home to shower and change as I was covered with bloodied vomit. When I returned the police had returned to gather statements from me, my trainee, and security about all that had happened, and also gave me the case number to pass along to my manager and the general manager; and they also informed me that she is doing alright and should be okay. At this point it was approximately 3:30 and it was time to begin the night audit training.
 
TL;DR: was training a new night auditor when we received a noise complaint that quickly evolved into saving someone’s life.

577,A Black cop and a White cop from California and a candy shop owner from Colorado,"I had lunch with my former FOM and a few friends the other day and she showed me a video of the new hire I helped train dealing with a nutty guest. The new hire was only on her 2nd week alone and already shes dealt with the crazy that we know a FD agent can't be adequately trained for but is something that comes with the job.

In walks a lady (Anti Civil Forfeiture) and everything is normal at first. New Hire gets the lady's car info, has her sign a pet policy form for her dog, occupancy info then gets to payment. She fumbles around with her wallet and cards a bit then sighs and says 

ACF: I really should have moved to New Mexico like I originally wanted--I AM from here you know.

NH: OK welcome back, card or cash Ma'am?

ACF: I was in California and wanted to move back to the area and I should have come back to NM they've outlawed civil asset forfeiture--you know that right?

NH: Actually I don't but Ill look into it.

ACF: You should before it's too late. All cops fall somewhere between evil and liars--most are evil. They are corrupt and run clandestine protection rackets against business owners like myself. I owned a business in California and it's always a black cop and a white cop demanding protection money. You have to wonder how they became so corrupt. I know trust me I was a defense contractor for 25 years--its the Justice Department. They target business owners like me because they can get away with it--they protect their own at our expense. The police chiefs wife where I lived in CA decided one day to steal his service weapon and shoot at cops. Nothing happened to him of course but his wife, his wife will be out in 5 years. It's criminal what they get away with. 

I thought I could get away from that by moving closer to home. I opened a candy shop in Colorado and guess what? A white cop and a black cop showed up and this time they began broadcasting all my legal proceedings from CA over the radio. They seized 75k of my assets so I had to shut that shop down and open a new one in a different town. I know some cops are good but most *flails arm in a circle* MOST are evil AND corrupt. Now I'm travelling across the US to prove that all police departments are dirty because *head shaking and dramatic pause* they are. 

NH: Um ... will that be cash or card?

ACF: Oh I'm sorry it'll be card.

They finish up and at the end ACF says 

""Remember they can't seize your assets in NM be happy you live here. It's amazing what they get away with its nutty.""

Nutty for sure, not so sure about the cops though.",46,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEF5C340>
578,As a night audit In a high standing hotel I'm used to disrespectful guests but sometimes I get faith in humanity back,"First off tips are never expected here in this country even for restaurants and personally my salary is more than enough to save up since I'm living with my parents

At 1am after the bar closed the man came down asking for baggage he left and since he was clearly drunk I decided to make an exception and bring it to his room for him, thus leaving the reception 

""you're a really nice person take this""  and he gave me 10.- while his wife who was sober thanked me aswell asking for my name and if I will be here with the manager in the morning so she can tell him I did a good job 

I will always remember this act of kindness in a workplace I usually have to throw out agressive and arrogant people and deal with annoying celebrities like rappers and such

579,I’m sorry I’m not a mind reader.,"I’m a hospital receptionist and although it’s not technically part of my job, I’m basically a glorified navigator to the entire hospital. It’s quite large and there are several sections to the hospital, also, the section of the hospital I work in doesn’t have general doctors offices.

Lady: hi, I have a doctors appointment and I don’t know where to go.

Me: no worries, I can help get you to the right place. What’s your doctors name?

The lady starts giving a bit of attitude but nothing too bad at this point. “Dr. ___” 

Me: okay, looks like I’m not finding the doctor with that name in our records. Is this a specialty visit or general checkup?

Lady: why is that any of your business? That’s weird and extremely uncomfortable for me to answer”

Me: I’m sorry, I think you’re in the wrong place and I’m trying to direct you where to go.

Lady: but shouldn’t you already know that? Look it up, my name is ****

Me: unfortunately I don’t have access to that because you’re in the wrong part of the hospital. I would need to know the general reason for your visit in order to send you in the right place.

Lady: That’s personal. I don’t understand why they hire such incompetent staff. What about HIPAA laws? This is so ridiculous.

Me: okay, I unfortunately don’t know where to send you then. Do you want me to get my boss? 

Lady: no, I’ll just figure it out myself. This hospital has gone downhill.

Me: I’m very sorry I wasn’t able to read your mind. Have a good one! 

The look on her face was priceless and my boss backed me up. Sometimes people really want to make you as miserable as they are and no one should have to put up with it.

580,The Tale of the Inappropriate Scam Caller,"I'm not gonna repeat what he said, because if I did, if be booted from the Sub Reddit.

With that said, presented for the midnight society is the Tale of the Lewd Scam Artist.

6am two weeks ago, I'm doing my audit reports, scanning them to email the hotel owner, when I get a call on the front desk phone. We've got caller ID, but it's blocked in this case. I answer it anyway, because it's late, I'm tired, and my mind is more on Christmas.

Gentleman on the other line says he's with corporate and needs me to sign for some documents from a 3rd party mail provider. Now, I reiterate. 6am. No one would deliver mail that early. He says he's already spoken to our head house keeper who he mentions by name. 

Here's the thing, I've already had this experience before last summer. Different scammers, same scam. They tell you they're with corporate, shipping something important to you, and name drop a superior to sell the bit. They then ask for your personal number so the ""third party mailer"" can call you. They have an intricate song and dance with the initial scammer pretending to give you a credit card number to give the fake mail person. That declines, and of course, they then beg you to supplement with your own money, sending to a payment app that you've never heard of to send money to a different country with promises of reimbursement and a raise. Last time, I almost lost a lot of money, but refused in the nick of time because it was not my money to give. It was fundraiser money for my sick mom. 

This time, I was wise to the game. Time for revenge.

I start with ""this all sounds a lot like a scam I encountered last summer"". I'm not a monster, I give him the chance to back out.

He assures me it's not, and says my name reminds him of his girlfriend. He also complements my voice.

I am a morbidly obese, balding, cishet man with a high voice. But it's another part of the scam I remember from before, try to schmooze the mark. But this idiot made the wrong call. I'm still kind of offended, not for being confused for a woman, but because he was toeing the line of being a sexist pig (it's like that John Mulaney bit about the sexist Blockbuster Employee). I told him to stop and that he'd be gravely disappointed. 

He finally got to the asking for my personal phone number. I had already googled fake ones and kept giving them to him. The dumping hotline, the take a shower hotline, so on and so forth. He was getting agitated. 

He demanded I give him my phone number and I said ""No. If you want my phone number so badly, you can look it up in my personnel file if you're actually from corporate.""

And then, it happens. He suddenly goes from an honest attempt at a scam to obscene phone caller, referring to my supposed lady parts and talking about how endowed he is. I'm not going into anymore detail than that. I'm a little stunned, but recover quickly. I've spent ten years on the internet. I've seen trolls like this time and again.

Then, bizarrely, he starts swapping back and forth between obscene phone call and a sincere attempt at scamming me.

I'm not budging, saying ""every minute you waste talking to me is another minute you're not trying to scam someone else.""

But, after about five minutes of his idiotic Jekyll/Hyde routine, I grew tired.

""You're very bad at your job and a chauvinist pig. I've got reports to email. Merry Christmas."" *click*

Something that only occurs to me now as I'm typing is that I was working that night to have Christmas off and my alternate who normally works that night is... Damaged (like plays with money in the till and fills out children's activity books damaged). So if it had been her and not me, she could have been tricked out of a lot of money either from her personal account or the hotel credit card. (To hammer that point home, just this weekend, she sold a room to a bunch of pothead teens without carding them and they made the hotel smell like a skunk. Never trust a cash stay, kids.)

I joke the night auditor is an unsung hero, but sometimes, we really do face crazies and save people.

And if this person calls you... Just hang up. My little attempt at catharsis was ultimately a waste of time and I just ended up needlessly subjected myself to some truly degrading language.",27,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEF5C0D0>
581,"Wow, just how tall IS this building?","Came into work at 11pm and noticed two guys in the bar loudly discussing politics (bar is on the other side of the lobby from the front desk). Didn't think much of it, not like it's all that unusual. Anyway, bar closes at midnight and one of the debaters departs the bar for parts unknown. The other one stops off at the market to buy some mac & cheese and charge it to his room. It was at this point I noticed he'd definitely had a few drinks at the bar. Still, not really causing any trouble. He gave me his room number, I verified his name, we went on with our lives. 

Maybe 20 minutes later, he comes back to the market and buys *another* bowl of microwave mac & cheese. He waves it at me and says the following:

""I'd like to charge this to room 200.""

Me: ""OK!"" (I remember him from the previous purchase so no verification necessary.)

""200. Two... Zero... Zero...""

""OK!""

582,"It might not make sense to you, but it's the truth.","Oh boy, I hate entitled people. I'm working my night shift and things have been slow and smooth so far. I'm sold out with 2 arrivals left, even though we only have 40 of 99 rooms sold because the rest are out of order due to a massive housekeeping shortage. We can barely get 1 housekeeper to come in daily, and every time they hire someone they don't like the job and quit. I don't blame them one bit but everyone else here is falling into the toxic, disgusting ""OMG no one wants to work what is going on"" mentality and I hate the hypocrisy because then they also complain about how little they get paid, then wonder why no one wants to work? Bruh. No one wants to work HERE. 

Guy comes in around 1:30am and doesn't say a word to me and is quickly opening his wallet already without telling me why he's there, like I'm supposed to immediately know and already be working on it. I say hello and ask if he has a reservation....

Guy: No.

Me: Are you looking for a room?

Guy: Yeah. You have one right?

Me: No I'm sorry, we are currently sold out. 

And I swear to you, I have not seen someone with such an incredulous look on their face in a long time. He looked so taken aback and angrily shocked like a typical Karen, like I just slapped his kid in the face. He just started shaking his head like he was so disappointed and upset at me for lying or something. So I thought maybe explaining why would help this asshat not be such an asshat.

Me: What rooms I do have are not clean or ready to be sold because the entire hospitality industry is going through a housekeeping shortage. What few housekeepers we do have are barely able to get enough clean to get us through each day. 

Guy doesn't say a word, just slowly walks out still shaking his head like everything I just said was a huge lie and I'm making stuff up just to get him to leave. Like I'm not renting to him of my own choosing. As he's leaving, still looking back at me like I punched his wife in the uterus, I tell him ""It may not make sense to you, but it's the truth."" He didn't acknowledge it and just got back in his truck and left. I  know, I know. Not gonna help and he's not gonna believe me. But it made me feel better and fuck that guy.

Edit: I want to acknowledge that this interaction definitely could have been worse, he could have been verbally abusive in some way or refused to leave and caused a scene. This is by no means the worst interaction I've had with a guest or potential guest. I just wanted to highlight how nonverbal overreactions are also irritating sometimes. 

Also, I also want to acknowledge that the fault for things like this IS ultimately the fault of the company not paying a good wage and not treating their employees like they matter. They are the ones who have dug this hole by not paying what other places nearby are willing to pay for the same job. Again, just trying to highlight this specific reaction as an annoying point in my night that others can relate to.",28,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEF5CD30>
583,"I'm sorry, you think I should have done better?","Last night, we were experiencing high winds. Our glass front lobby was rattling. Doors were getting forced open. The AC units couldn't handle the chilly air being forced into them. Mumbly Mike started going off about ghosts. And upstairs... we have an open air bar.


Around 3:30 in the morning, a guest comes down saying that there's something slamming around on the top floor. Like someone with a sledgehammer. Okay, I'll check it out. Up I go, listening. Sure enough, it's really loud up there. Some of it is howling winds, but I definitely hear the banging. It's louder on one side, but I can't pinpoint a room... and then I realize it's coming from the roof. Shit.


Now, our bar runs as a completely separate department. We frequently have no idea what they're doing up there. They use a different POS, they keep their own schedules(and forget to tell us what they are...), and just generally do their own thing. I have only been up to the bar a few times, usually just to steal back our kitchen carts from the elevator landing. All this is to say, *I do not know where things are up there.* It's just not my business. But up I go.

I don't think I really need to describe how miserable it was up there, but I will anyways, because I come here to bitch. The enclosed hallway leading up to the back of the bar had deep puddles from the rain. The wind howled. The garage style doors around the bar itself rattled loudly, and I struggled to open them(and then struggled to open the right one, as every section had its own switch, unlabeled). Eventually I made it onto the roof, and it was terrifying. Chairs were tipped over. The string lights shook. The puddles rippled. And somewhere up here was a loud SLAM in time with the wind. I eventually made it out onto the roof proper, and found that the mop sink closet had been left unlocked, with the padlock shut. Cue mad scrambling up and down the elevator to get the bar-specific keys that might be able to get this padlock back where it belongs. It's while I'm fumbling around with the keys, lit by only the trembling string lights, that I realize none of it would make a difference. The plate that attaches the lock to the wall was detached. The door had no way to hold itself shut.


I try blocking it with a chair. SLAM. The chair is nothing to this heavy steel door. I try a table instead. It slams about while I try to drag the table closer, and then it pushes away the table. I add a second table. Slightly less slamming. I add a *third fucking table*, two high tops and a low, just to cover the bases, and that seems to do the trick. Damp and uncomfortable, I return to my desk and hear nothing more.


Until the GM wakes up. Our GM is notorious for reading half of whatever you wrote and then jumping to whatever conclusion puts you in the worst light. Her catchphrase is ""We must do better !!"" So of course, she decides I must have been slacking off. I should have fixed it faster. If you're familiar with the idea of a ""compliment sandwich"", putting criticisms between more positive comments to soften the blow, our GM gave me an insult sandwich. Blah blah blah we must address concerns, good job blocking the door, more wild assumptions.

584,I love my job I love my job.... Fuck that need the job,"So I was told at time of hire that the boss wanted me to be his right hand guy when I'm trained... I've only had this job now... Well starting week three now.  I had to pull a double, deal with two rightfully angry patrons, and we're lucky if we can get a hold of the boss 

The lack of being able to contact him and his lack of communication with us (teamwork what the hell is that?) Is what caused one issue.  A coworker called the cops on a paid patron and was smug about it when she was escorted out.  

Then yesterday the least trained person (me) ended up doing a double because one co worker who I swear the only reason she's there is the boss thinks she's hot (she isn't, and can't do her job when she is there so we're always cleaning up her mistakes), didn't come in.  She said she called in, but no one at work knew about it.  And well we couldn't get a hold of the GM until 7am this morning.

His reason?  ""Oh my phone must have died when I was asleep"".  For 48 hours?  I'm thinking when trained.  Instead of being his right hand man... My co workers might insist on me taking his job... Maybe, if I can fire the dead weight.

Edit:  Now sitting at 40 hours in 2 days.  So yeah that letter will be sent.  Because we need a gm that does his fucking job and steps up when his workers flake.  We have 2 out because sick (doubt one has covid she just wanted time off) the other has been here almost every day since I started sooo yeah.

We haven’t had a head of housekeeping at our hotel for about three months now. We also don’t have our own laundry facility yet (under construction, they decided to open the hotel a year ago before they even broke ground on that.) so we send linens etc out to the only local wash & fold. Multiple times I have informed management of shortages of linens and towels. Multiple times I’ve warned them about our stain pile. Wash & fold does not treat stains. We need probably more than double what we have in sheets right now. Today, wash and fold brought back our linens which we so desperately needed since they were closed for the new year…… Sans pillow cases. So now, we’re going on almost an hour since checkin and we have about 10 sold rooms with no pillowcases. The only thing keeping me sane right now is Paul McCartney.

586,"Welp, I quit: management","On Thursday I made a questionable decision to eat some vegan pesto pasta, made with sauce I left out the night before. It looked a little off, but I was starving and stupid. Lo and behold, I come home from work and feel exhausted beyond belief. I wake up at 1 am, nauseous to the bone, and proceed to throw up everything in my body. Everything.

I text my boss that morning (still sick) that I can't come into work today. He's distrusting - it's new years so I must be skipping work to go to a party. He asks for proof via a time-stamped doctors visit. Well, there's no way in hell I'm getting into a moving vehicle. I would rather die than get off this couch. Actually, I would welcome death.

Saturday rolls around and I'm feeling so much better! Nausea is completely gone, and I'm just tired from the physical act of vomiting and the dehydration. I tell my boss I can be back tomorrow. He says no, and to please send proof that I was sick. I ask if I can send him texts with the lady I was housesitting for. My dad had to go let her dog out because I couldn't, and he lost her dog because he didn't leash her when he let her outside. It was a very tearful exchange and I was apologizing profusely, saying I would be there the moment I felt better to find her dog (ps, the dog was found). Jokingly, I add that I can send him pictures of my throwup, but I figured that that was pretty gross. He says no, I need to bring a doctors note or be terminated.

Well damn. You don't pay me enough to pay my bills and the doctor, and you don't provide health insurance. It also feels like you don't trust me. I ignore the text and message him later, ""I'm scheduled for 11 monday, right?"" Usually I don't work Mondays and Tuesdays, but he needed someone to train a new hire. ""No."" Oh?

""I thought I was training someone?""

""No."" ???

That's when I realize it. I'm a 23 year old woman with a college degree making less than I made at sixteen and not even getting health insurance, putting up with a boss who thinks I would ruin someone's new years by lying that I was sick.

So when one of our guests from New Years Eve decided that they wanted to stay an additional night, I already knew that I couldn't sell those two rooms to anyone else anyways, and I let them stay.

I mean, we could smell it in the hallway, and burning a candle UNATTENDED, causing the jar to shatter  and setting off the smoke alarm was stupid...but if you want to give us another $700 in room revenue *before* taxes, and *before* the additional authorizations I was tacking on to cover the smoking fees, I'm just being a good front desk agent and helping you to do that.

I'm working as AM supervisor but staying later so the PM shift can get organized and take a break.  Today I was finally on the way out the door when my colleague gets a phone call.  She just made a res for a man and told him that same day reservations were not cancelable.  He understood and made the res and then calls back less then an hour later to cancel.  She AGAIN explains that we cannot cancel same day res and that he will be charged.  He accuses her of ripping him off and then starts using profanities.  She asks me to finish the call and tells me that we can waive the fee but he can't stay here.  I get the phone and he immediately starts going off. I try to ask if he still wants to cancel and he keeps going.  

Guest: Are you going to hang up on me like she did?

Me: It's tempting

Guest: Go ahead! See what happens! I'm recording you! 

Me: I don't consent to being recorded.

Guest: Are you going to give me my money back?

Me: Sir we haven't taken any money from you yet.  We can waive the fee but you will not be allowed on the property.

591,Why Is It Always on My Shift?,"Literally why?

So I'm here on a busy day, alone (thanks new guy for no call no show), running around like a chicken with my head cut off, doing my \~manager\~ tasks (GM is on vacation again in as many months), and running FD. I'm on the phone with my GM discussing schedule and new guy. And my maintenance man calls.

Y'all, he never calls me. Its always me calling or texting.

So I put my boss on hold. I answer. Maintenance says ""Come up to room 340"" I say ""what?"" and he repeats himself and hangs up.

I put my little away from desk sign up and hurry up to the room. My maintenance man, Executive Housekeeper, and another Housekeeper standing outside the room.

In my head, I'm like ""that's weird"" so I'm in panic mode. I ask them what's going on. I am immediately greeted by a mix of English and Spanish. Now, I am in Texas, so I know SOME Spanish but not at the level and speed that it's being thrown at me.

I get everyone to stop talking and ask my MM to explain the situation. He tells me that there is a guy in a room that is supposed to be empty, and he is hiding. He was sleeping in the closet and scared the HK for that part of the floor. She then called EH and MM for back up. In the >2 minutes it took them to get to her, the guy moved and hid in the shower. MM then called me.

I grab a broom (why self?) and go in the room, using the broom to open the shower curtain. Nobody is in there. I check the closet. Nobody. I check behind the side of the bed towards the wall. Nada.

I then go out of the room ask them ""Y'all are fucking with me right? There's nobody in there"" MM & EH are stridently telling me that there was someone in there. The three of them come in there with me.

We don't see anyone. I checked one last place. Behind the chair, as it looks slightly out of position. There is a person crouched down like in a ball, almost like a toddler would hide.

I yell (very unprofessionally) ""Holy fuck there's someone in there."" and the 4 of us charge out. I tell MM to keep an eye on the room. I call 911. I explain the situation. They say it will take them a bit to get to us as local pro sports team is playing in town. It takes them 40 minutes.

I check with MM a few minutes before the police gets there, guy has not come out. Police finally get there. I explain the situation. They go up to the room. Guy hid from the police in the same spot.

They get him out of the hiding spot. He first gives them a fake name. Then he tells them 2 versions of how he got a key to vacant, dirty room.

First he says my AM gave it to him. I let one officer know absolutely not. Then he says the guest that was in the room gave it to him. Also no. Guest checked out early and let us know.

I finally get his name. Dude had a reservation coming in that day but no ID and card declined so he never got checked in.

It takes over 30 minutes for the police to get him out of there. They asked me if I wanted to criminally trespass him. I say ""yeah"" because I'm like 80% certain we had issues with him in 2021. He looks SO familiar. The officer tells me what to say and I say it.

This mf has the GALL to look at me and say ""Well you didn't have to say it so mean."" and flip me off as he walks out.

Why do I always get the shit?

592,I'm seriously thinking about leaving the hotel industry,"My tale today isn't about a guest, it's about me and whether I should stay in hotels. And a little about Management. 

I've been working in the hotel industry since 2015, so going on 7 years, ever since I graduated from community college where I studied Hospitality and Tourism. I love my job, the people I meet, my co-workers, but the weight of Covid has hit me really hard. 

When the first wave hit, I was laid off for 13 months, and I only just got back to my hotel this past April. The guests are worse than ever, and the travel industry is still hit and miss, meaning I could lose hours at any point. That's not the main issue at hand, but it's definitely a concern. 

Our General Manager retired in June after 14 years managing the hotel, which she opened. We got a new GM from another property in the city and she's generally well liked. The new Manager decided that we could use a Front Desk Supervisor, so naturally, I put in my name for it. The only other person that applied was our newest hire who had been here just over 3 months, that came from the property our new GM came from. The GM and FOM conducted the interviews with us, and in the end, they decided to go with the new hire because she had ""previous Manager experience"". I was disappointed to say the least, but I had no hard feelings towards anyone. 

Fast forward to a couple weeks ago, when we were told that the FOM would be leaving to pursue a new career. I was told by the GM that she would not be hiring a new FOM, but rather would train myself and the Supervisor more so that, when we're both ready, the Supervisor would become the FOM and I would be next in line for Supervisor. 

This is where I'm questioning if I want to stay in the industry. I know that I shouldn't count my chickens before they hatch, but I'm worried that the Supervisor will get promoted and I'll be told that I'm ""not ready yet"". Even though whenever I work a shift with another FDA I'm always the MOD because they (Management) know that I can handle any guest situations that could come up, and know that the hotel will be secure while I'm here. I'm also always the person they call if someone calls in sick, but is guilt tripped for needing to leave early because I actually didn't feel well. I hardly ever take a sick day, and if I do, then there's seriously something wrong. 

The FOM and I have always got on well, and she's said that if she wasn't my boss we could actually be friends. We were talking about all this the other day, and she said that she didn't want to leave, but no one was fighting for her to stay, meaning the new GM. I forget exactly what she said, but the GM said something to the FOM in the likes of ""you only do and say things to get sympathy"". The GM also told something to the FOM that I had told the GM in confidence. I tell stories about my day to my boyfriend, and he's told me that my workplace is toxic with all the gossip and backstabbing, but that's gone on at every hotel I've worked in. 

I want to advance in my career and ideally be a Front Desk Manager, but I feel like I'll never get there because Management always thinks that I'm not ready for the ""next step"". I don't want to be an Agent forever. I don't know how long I should tough it out or wait to be promoted, because I've applied for Supervisor positions elsewhere and they all say that I don't have any experience, but I can't get any if no one will give me the opportunity. 

I'm sorry for the long post/rant, I just don't know what to do.",21,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEF5C430>
593,"Kevin, stahp!","Yesterday was easily one of the most hectic days for me working FD morning shift. Tons of last minute stayovers, hungover guests taking too much time to check out, phone ringing off the hook and a few random walk ins still in their party clothes looking for a place to crash. 

A middle aged man came down to the front desk and he was already angry, I could see steam rising from his balding head. We'll call him Kevin. He proceeded to rant and rave about charges to his card, saying we took his money and he wants it back NOW. He threw out plenty of F bombs and other curses, steadily increasing his volume as I attempted to diffuse the situation.

I calmly explained that the charges he was speaking of were just authorizations and that he would be getting his money back when he checked out. I printed out his receipt and handed it to him, telling him that the charges on the receipt would be the final amount total paid. This did nothing to ease his mind, instead he walked off still fuming and cursing and crumpling up the paper.

I call my managers and they didn't answer, I was anticipating more trouble from Kevin and wanted to document it so that if I needed to escalate the situation I had my bases covered. Sure enough he came back, this time with a full luggage cart and his wife. I ask if he's checking out and he lunges at me, throwing the paperwork I gave him onto my desk. 

His poor wife was trying to calm him down and she was visibly overwhelmed with his tantrum. ""Honey, I understand what she's saying and it sounds like we'll get the money back, it just takes the bank a few days"", she said sheepishly. ""I'll be 9 states away by then, call your fucking manager RIGHT NOW"", he said, launching his key cards directly at my face. 

That's when I had enough. I wrote down my managers name and number, told him we were done with his abusive behavior and asked him to leave. I looked at the wife and told her to have a nice day. Left a detailed note for the manager in case he wants to try and dispute all charges on his card. This isn't the first time this has happened and usually it is over something trivial like authorizations or incidentals. Any advice on how to better explain these standard hotel policies and practices? Sometimes I fail to explain when put on the spot like Kevin did.

594,New Staff means miserable next shift...why!!,"Sorry I'm beyond frustrated and exhausted today!

Came to shift with too many druggies in house.  Why is it when they hire new staff, you always have the sit down chat of ""GET CREDIT CARD or in extreme circumstances and they are very nice people you may allow a large damage deposit (cash/debit) on top of the room payment (usually $3-500)

I mean this ""chat"" is a sit down with the company owner and a huge important thing.  It's rule one!

I come in to find druggies almost passing out in our breakfast room with no deposits, other room with a $200 cash deposit and no room payment.  I mean common!!  you were told to do ONE main job.

Yes i feel sick from the stress of now having to call the cops at 11 when they don't leave.  And they never do!   Does anyone else get the ""oh I just need another 30 minutes to pack up"" and they will aim to stay until you do have to call the cops.   I try to keep it civil and say sorry sold out no rooms you have to leave, but that always leads to cops and yelling.

2. Not doing so can result in your car being towed as any car without the permit is considered a non-guest car.

3. We hand out parking permits to every single person who checks in unless they don’t have a car.

4. We don’t charge a dime for parking permits or charge a nickel for parking.

So it’s literally a couple of days ago when we tow a car from our lot due to not having a parking permit AND parking in the no parking area.I checked with security and he showed me that there was no parking permit in the windows or the dash or anywhere in the car (we generally try to avoid towing so if there is a problem, we try to find the ticket and then use the ticket to call the room if they need to move a car or there is an issue). With it not there at all, I instruct security to call the towing company and his car is towed from our parking lot.

He comes down five minutes later.

Oh my GOD.

Tray of food in hand and scowling he erupts from the elevator shouting.

First thing he demands to know is who the hell towed his car.

I tell him the towing company towed his car as it didn’t have a permit visible and he was parking on a non-parking area. He shouts saying he did have a permit in his car and we need to call the company to get the car back, which we do but the operator hangs up on us after saying hello. Rude, but we tell him that we cannot reach the company. He literally pounds on the table to get the point across to try to intimidate us into submission while yelling at us. He demands we bring it back and if we can’t do that, pay for the impound, and he doesn’t care if we have to wake up our supervisor or owners or whoever to get his car back.

He also is eating while yelling and food bits fly out of his mouth to hit my collar and splatter against the plastic panels now in effect because of Omicron and Delta and COVID in general while I cringe in disgust.

I ignore him  for a moment to grab a tissue and some hand sanitizer to wipe my neck while security explains that we didn’t find his ticket and his car was parking on the red area that is not allowed for parking and had he put his ticket up, we would have had no problem calling his room to tell him he needs to move his car. He doesn’t care and demands to talk to our boss or corporate or whoever can fix this.

I tell him they wont be here till morning and it might not even be our supervisor as I am not privy to their schedule. However, I do inform him that they are probably going to say the same thing as we have photographic proof his ticket was not in the car. He accuses us that we are only telling our side of the story AND ARE TWISTING FACTS.

His excuse for the non-visible ticket?

“I must of closed the door to my car too hard and the wind pushed it out of my car!”

His excuse for the no park area?

“I couldn’t find parking anywhere else that was close!”

I am already running on thin patience with this guy and calmly tell him that we didn’t see a permit, and if he is so sure it is in there, he can call the company itself to have his car examined.

He cusses me out, sulks, talks on the phone with someone, and gets picked up later.

When he left that day, we blacklisted him and his accompaniment (she was so mad and yelled at him over the phone outside our lobby while he apologized to her).

As it turns out, we found his parking pass.

Crumpled up and tossed behind his couch in the room.",100,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEF5CC40>
596,Ahh the kevin of the night,"Phone rings

Thanks for calling.... how can i help you?

Kevin- yea i just made a reservation and can you check me in? Im a diamond member... 

Blah blah blah. ( keep in mind its already after midnight and have 1 reservation left and hes not the one). 

He says his last name and i knew i didnt have on on file for tonight. 

Na- yes sir... i see that this is for tomorrow for check in at 3pm. I unfortunately cannot change  this for check in tonight. 

Every na on here knows that we dont turn over our days till like 3 or 4 in the morning. So it may be the 2nd but our system is still in the 1st. 

And begin hissy fit coming from a grown ass man. 

Kevin- ARE YOU SERIOUS? I AM A DIAMOND MEMBER THIS IS REDICULOUS. I SHOULD BE ABLE TO CHECK IN BECAUSE ITS FOR THE 2ND. AND TODAY IS THE 2ND. 

na- i understand that but as all hotels are our systems arent turned over till 3 am and that reservation issnt until check in for 3pm. It may be after midnight but our systems are still in the day before. 

Kevin- you cant just change it to let me check in for now. 

Na- no im not authorized to be able to do that. 

Kevin- im a diamond blah blah blah i do a lot of business with you. Im calling the hotline. Hangs up 

Me thinking ( ok you do that. Im still not able to change anything) 

Actually i really can but after being yelled at over the phone imma be a bit petty tonight. 

So im waiting on either him to show up or the hotel line to call me. If they did call i was about to get ready to call a bitch out. The people working that line know damn well what time we turn over our days and have no control over how people book and dont read their reservation. 

Neither happen. He calls back like 3 times and finally a makes a new one with me. Telling me "" this has never happened to him before"". Yea right. I try to just get him to do a walk in that way he would get charged if he did show. But insisted i take his info. Claims he will be here in like 20 its been almost a hr and he aint showed. 

I actually go to try and change it but because it was a redemption booking i cant make any changes to it or cancel it. Oh well that a problem for the gm tomorrow. 

I just wanna know when the fuck people decided that yelling at service people for their own fuck ups will get them anywhere? Its like youre really throwing a bitch fit over something that is your own damn fault cause you didnt read your reservation correctly? 

I really want to ask this dick how old he is and if he can read?or has the mental capability to function in society. 

I have 4 nights left at this property i dont give a fuck at this point. Call the hotline call the gm in the morning they cant do anything to me. Nor would they since they haven't found my replacement yet. So yea go fuck yourself kevin.",22,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEF5C9A0>
597,Can you please stop standing right in front of the sliding glass door letting in a bunch of cold air!?,"Our lobby is on the smaller side I would say the sliding glass door is about 10-15 feet from the front desk. It's winter and it is fucking cold..

I don't understand how people don't realize they are standing right in front of the door causing it to open 10 fucking times. Like were you raised in a barn. My Grandma would threaten to whoop my ass if I even left the door open for longer than 5 seconds. I can still here her voice saying ""WE ARE NOT HEATING/COOLING the outside!"" 

Last week I had a huge family come down to the lobby and they literally stood right in the doorway, so the door was constantly staying open (we also have one of those fans for flies or whatever so the loud ass fan kicks on too when the door is open) They literally stood in the door way for like 2 mins, until I finally walked over and said can you please come inside or stay outside it is very cold, and you are blocking access for guests to come and go. The entitlement on these fucks, they looked at me like ""whats the big deal"" they finally went outside but continued to stand close enough that the door would close but if they moved slightly it would open again.

And just now (why I am writing this story) I had a guest waiting for a lyft and he was standing right next to the door constantly making it open and I am cold as shit. It makes me question peoples intelligence. Like how do you not see the doors constantly open and here the loud fan from the door? 

Side tangent: I hate when you are at a plaid pantry/mini mart and they have one of those sensors by the front door that make like a dinging sound. And theres always that smooth brain dumb ass that stands next to the sensor making it go off constantly and you can see the hamster wheel spinning and after a solid minute of beeping they realize they are the ones causing the noise.

598,Nothing like a domestic dispute and Raisin Bran everywhere to end 2021!,"I was in my office when one of my coworkers came up to me and ask if I heard the fight.  Of course I livened right up and said “what?! Fight!? Who?!” I went to the desk and  he had the room number of the guy who was involved and I immediately recognized the name - a local  high tier member who I put on our DNR list back in March because him and his “girlfriend” (also a high tier member) were always causing issues at the hotel.  

One of our newer desk agents checked him in on the 30th and we had no issues with him that night that we heard of.  Well, he extends another night, his girl comes to see him and it all goes downhill.  

Our houseman was upstairs vacuuming the hallways and the guy came out and asked for towels and was overly polite about it (he always is) and then went back in the room after receiving them.  A few minutes later, our houseman overheard them screaming and her shouting “where the f*ck is the money?!?!” and things slamming.  He called backup and they went to approach the door and the guy went running out of the room and down the stairwell.  They knocked on the door and the female says “just a minute, I’m in the shower!!” all calm and casual like nothing happened at all.  They knock again and she comes bolting out of the room and down the hallway.  Once the door opened, they got a good look at the room - completely destroyed by the two of them from their fight.  Panel with the nightstand torn completely off the wall, broken desk, phone and alarm clock thrown across the room, keurig slammed on the floor, broken glass everywhere, trash everywhere, and an exploded huge bag of Raisin Bran they had obviously stole from our breakfast area.  Everything was also wet because she had thrown a gallon jug of water at him and it exploded. 

I tried to contact him, but of course he didn’t answer.  I contacted our brand and had both of their memberships temporarily deactivated until corporate reviews my email and photos I sent them.  Man I hope he tries to come back in the future.",42,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEF5C280>
599,"Crash, Bam - ""I don't wannaaaaa evacuate...""","Have now seen 2 posts about cars crashing into hotel/hotel properties so thought I'd share my own. It is a few years back and details slight fuzzy but hey, let's join the party I guess?

So many years and hotels ago in my career I worked at a 100 room hotel, it was part of a larger international chain BUT this one was not well run/maintained and was located on an infamous North American street known for being...let's just say a small speck of Hell on Earth, thus with the expected Chad's, Karen's and other terrible, terrible hotel guests.

It is a slow spring's day and I am alone at the FD, no manager on site ( constant rotation of FOM's quitting that admin could not keep filled) just me and the houseman and a small handful of housekeeper's. Around the middle of my shift I suddenly hear a loud BAM, CRACK and the slight sensation of the FD shaking!

I look around quickly and see a bright red car has crashed into one of the pillars in our covered driveway entrance, in other words our loading zone for when guests are checking in before they go into our underground parking. This drive-through zone has 4 large, big pillars in the middle which are structural and help to support the floors above where many guest rooms are located. There is no one in the car which is super weird so I'm calling 911 because WTF? where is the driver?

The lovely female Operator is great at keeping me calm as I explain my very strange issue ( I'm worried this is a support pillar, where's the driver, i'm essentially alone at the FD with one phone) and she tells me as a precautionary measure we need to evacuate the rooms above until at least the Fire Department arrives and can check if the pillar is safe. 

So cue me quickly putting 911 *on hold*, *what*? As i start calling houseman and housekeeping to help let people know to leave the rooms. THEN oh then one guest who gets housekeeping knocking on the door apologetically saying they need to evacuate decides they don't want to unless emergency services says they have to, to their face. **NO**! Sorry buddy I'm not dealing with your drugged out bullshit. I call up and say ""Sorry evacuation is not optional get out of the room now, I am on the phone with 911 and they say this is required.""

Cue whiney idiot ""But I'm tired, is it really that bad, I don't wannaaaaaaa"" in an absolute bratty voice. Dude you're in your mid 20's, I checked you in 2 days ago you are to old to sound like a toddler!

&#x200B;

Eventually Fire comes by, turns out it's safe hurrah go back to your rooms (Yes Mr. Whiney you can go now) and we find out that the cars parking brake failed and somehow the car rolled down the hill behind us and it the building without hitting anyone or anything else on it's way down. I'm done.",13,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEF5C3D0>
600,"I finally interviewed for my""dream"" brand and it did not go my way.","Most people I know from hotels were able to walk away and never look back. However, I live this cursed cycle of always coming back.

I promised to post more stories and I failed, so I'm gonna try to make up for lost time.

[After leaving my last property](https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheFrontDesk/comments/re7li9/my_brief_return_to_front_desk_made_me_leave/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) I was invited by a recruiter to apply for an AFOM position with my favorite brand in my hometown (this is a very important detail for later)

On the outside, this brand was known to have ops managers who were kind of smug and arrogant (I was acquaintance with a few and they didn't help the perception) Ironically, I always wanted to work for this brand; not really for the prestige (humble brag but I've worked in properties that were on par or better) but they were known to keep their people happy, offer top pay, and great benefits. I have applied to this brand in different markets throughout my career but could never even get an interview; so I of course took this as a sign. 

After breezing through HR, I was hitting it off with the DoR to the point that the interview turned into an hour and a half long conversation. I left that interview already with a salary agreement, the next scheduled interview with DoF, and the assurance that the job was essentially mine. (She stopped using ""if"" and started using when) Unfortunately, everything would go downhill after our virtual meeting.

Interview with DoF did not go well at all, starting with the fact that he was 20 min late. We had webcam issues, (long story but I had to go to Walmart and buy a Chromebook for this damn thing) Me and this guy did not click at all and in my opinion; he interviewed poorly. As someone who was formerly a department head and made hiring decisions, I dislike when people are reading resumes during the interview. In the last 10 years I have worked 7 properties under 3 brands, on the surface this may seem alarming. What if I told you that one brand I departed Feb 2020, and the other was from my last story; different narrative right? When asked why I left the last property, I stated it was because I needed to be closer to my family. My biggest issue, he would finish my responses in a condescending manner. I left that interview knowing that I would be offered a lower position at best.

Up until now, every interaction would happen within 2 days. I turned in my resume on a Tuesday and my interview with the DoF was that following Monday. After the interview, I would hear from the property until the next Monday and it was an email from the DoR asking if I would consider being that Night manager. I stated that I would consider it and after a few questions, I asked what the difference in salary was... 13k less! Now, my personal belief is that the overnight shift should be the higher paid shift when you consider the fact that they have almost no support and it's difficult to fill the position and keep them happy. In response, I asked for them to waive the relocation assistance & stipend for 3k more per year. I backed it up with the fact that the only difference between the 2 positions was the amount of guest interaction, and various examples of my experience but I would not hear from them for 2 weeks. By the time I would hear from them, I was already in my hometown and received a phone call from the DoF that both positions were full.

I'd be lying if I didn't say I was bitter. For the first time in my career, I interviewed for a job and was not made an offer. What bothered me, I was never even offered any of the housekeeping positions despite my very heavy experience (I guess I didn't build as good of a rapport as I thought) I always reflect on interviews and I always view myself as my harshest critic (despite my own arrogance in my ability) Before I could give up and just leave it to the fact that we weren't a good fit, Afom position was reposted (I have LinkedIn premium) 

To this day, the position has not been filled. How do I know? A head hunter reached out to me 2 days ago offering me to interview for the same position. But I'm over it, and luckily I just interviewed with a property over in Texas and it is going well...",31,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CCD63430>
601,Local Woman Answers Her Own Question,"Okay, this will probably be shorter, but I just have to rant. 

The property I'm at is currently undergoing renovations; I'm sure anyone in the same role as me can imagine the delightful results of staying open through a large scale renovation. 

This woman came down to check out. Naturally, as rudely as possible, she says ""Is there a *reason* that someone was doing the floor above me at 8:30 AM? I know you're under renovations but couldn't it wait until later?"" 

I just wanted to yell, this is so constant. No, the workers won't come in later. Yes, it sucks. You were informed on check in. What did you think we were renovating, the vibes? Of course there is going to be noise. I am so sorry. It sucks, especially for me, because I work here and I have to deal with the same stupid complaint every day, AS WELL AS the noise. 

It just drives me up the wall, I mean, some people have *real* problems. But I have to listen to a bottle blonde complain that the hotel under renovations has more noise than usual.",10,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEFE9250>
602,"Crash, boom, bang","Ok, I've just read an account on this sub about a drunk driver crashing into the wall of a hotel.

Now this brings back some memories from six years ago.

I'm working in a smallish hotel in a very busy European summer-tourism destination

Our hotel, however, is located in a quiet side-street, that  usually doesn't see a lot of traffic. It is also located right next to a small but steep bridge which spans across a small canal.

That particular day, I was minding my own business, when suddenly I heard a loud crashing noise ( hence the title of ""crash, boom, bang"" ).

I looked up from my desk and saw my colleagues working in the lobby bar rushing outside.

I went outside and saw the following:

A car with two young guys inside had crashed into our outer wall, which is about 80 cm high (sorry, don't know the imperial measures). Anyway, it's one of these small walls you tend to have in in Europe which separates your premises from the street.

And they also destroyed one of our rubbish bins and damaged two rental cars.

Police were called, of course, and the coppers immediately said that these two boys must have gone across the bridge at top speed, thus using the bridge as a ramp, and the rest is history.

Luckily, none of the boys got seriously hurt, but it was later discovered that they were driving under the influence of illicit herbs.",14,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEFE91F0>
603,The Only Time I've Been Scared For My Safety,"Let me set the stage.  It was midnight on a dark and stormy night in summer 2018 at a Square Plaza.

I had just checked in a band (notable enough to have wikipedia page) that got stranded after a show and was fielding calls from people stranded at the nearby airport.  I then get a call from the lead singer of the band who informs me there is a party in the suite across the hall.  I apologize and head up.  Luckily, it was after 12 with no more scheduled arrivals, so I didn't have to worry about those with reservations showing up while I handled the party.

I get to the room and find probably the largest unauthorized party I have dealt with where there are a good three-four dozen people crammed into a suite.  I tell them they will need to go to the lobby or leave the property.  The sober-ish ones comply and begin to go the lobby.  Those remaining protest and question why.  I go through the usual spiel, but one of the guests decides that if he threatens an ass kicking that I'll go away.

Obviously this doesn't work, and I now give the ""You have five minutes to vacate before I call the cops"" speech.  The remaining guests protest, but at least some were wise enough to restrain their friend who threatened me and still seemed to want a fight.  Usually when a guest threatens me, their body language presents no threat, although I'll evict anyone who threatens me.  This time though, it actually seemed like the guest might try something.

Those inside continue to yell and protest.  The surrounding guests, including the singer, say they will call the police if I don't do anything.  I inform them that I am on the phone with the dispatcher who tells me to leave the area and wait for police.

While heading to the lobby, a guest from the party threatens to ""shoot up the front desk.""  Unlike his friend who threatened me, there was no danger presented in the tone/body language, but I was thinking: ""Do you watch the news?  Thank God the police aren't here yet as people have been shot for far less.""

When I get to the lobby, the first guest who threatened me comes down demanding the customer service number.  Normally I love instances like this because I get to be a smug ass.  This time though, I told him ""No"", and he did the bit where he says I have to as he's the customer.  While doing this, he is pounding his fists on the counter.  I tell him to step back or I'm hitting the panic button to which he says ""Fucking do it.""  Luckily for me, the police arrive at that moment , and the guest has to literally be pulled away from the front desk and dragged outside by his friends.  The first responding officer even asks ""Is that one of them?""  To which I confirm.

We go up to the room where there is still a good two dozen people and begin the eviction process again.  The remaining guests continued to be beligerant to both me and the responding officers.  One guests made some snide comment about how little I was probably getting paid(she was correct though), while others protested that they would get arrested if they drove.(at least they were sober enough to realize that).  The police officers did affirm that, yes, the guests would be arrested if they got behind the wheel, but asked if I would be able to call taxis if needed.  It was slow, but eventually everyone leaves.(and gets a ride)

While the eviction is going on though, a woman approaches and asks if she needs to leave too since she booked the room her brother was using.  I tell her she can stay as the eviction is on the party room in question.  This seems to work at first, but she comes back later asking if I can let her brother stay on her promise that he'll behave.  I tell her I can't do that, and she becomes more irate.  I'm guessing she was drinking in her room, and it took some time for the alcohol to kick in as she went from calm to yelling up and down the hall.  The cops then ask if I want her gone too, to which I affirm.  When we go to evict her room, there is probably around a half dozen people from the first room now in her room.

Eventually, both rooms are evicted and I can get back to my usual night audit obligations.

Given the sister booked the rooms, that there is a 21 c/i minimum, and how young the guests looked, I'm guessing I broke up someone's 18th birthday.  That said, the guy who seemed serious in his threat was quite a bit bigger than my scrawny ass.",16,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEFE9520>
604,"""Wheres my ocean view?!""","Happy New Year Everyone!!!!!

Some back story I've been working at the same property for 5 years now and our property is in a touristy beach area. Now the number one draw is every room has a balcony with a DIRECT ocean view. No side or partial views, only DIRECT in your face views.

In order to accomplish this the entrance doors are facing the parking lot so when you walk in you see the balcony and view dead in front of you.

Had a guest come to check-in, everything went smoothly. I gave them the keys and off they went. Not 5 minutes late they come to the desk slam the keys on the desk and yell ""I was told we'd have an ocean view and I'm staring at a parking lot!"" I calmly said ""sir, did you walk into your room? Because all of our rooms have a direct ocean view and balcony."" He proceeds to tell me ""No, we didn't we got to the door and turned around because all we saw was a parking lot."" I told them to please go unlock the door and walk in the room and they will see they have exactly what they asked for.

They went back upstairs and I didn't hear from them for the rest of their stay. The stupidity of some people still astounds me to this day.

I told them that unless they’re a stranded traveler, and they have an airline voucher, we cannot waive the cash deposit if they pay cash. They scoff at that and immediately accuse me of racism. It pisses me off so much when they resort to that. 

I mean seriously my PMS won’t split payments with cash and card. If I take a card it will authorize for the entire amount. All third party reservations are done through direct bill. I had my manager complete the reservation, but it still pissed me off to no end. Of course it was the associates parents that acted this way. Why is it always the parents that do this.

607,Is it always like this? I’m fucking dying inside.,"This is more of a rant/cry for help more than anything else. I’m sorry if this is a bad place for this, but I need to talk to *someone* who can at least reassure me that I’m not going completely batshit insane (probably am anyway). Or even to tell me that it’s like this everywhere and just suck it up. I’m sorry for any bad grammar/spelling/word salad. It’s been a really tough week. Also posting this on an alt account as my normal one is too identifiable. 

This is long as fuck.

I started working as a receptionist in November. Had a brief insurance gig before this, and was in a well-known retailer for just shy of 8 years. Never worked hospitality before.

I want to start by saying that I love this job, I love my colleagues, but I swear this place is cursed. Without giving away too many details (it’s a very specific situation), an incident happened with a nearby property around Christmas, which has sent the whole hotel into disarray as it was supposed to be a very peaceful period. 

*Spoiler alert: it’s been a fucking shitshow!!! Skeleton crew + a floor that’s currently OOB + a full house = a massive pain in my arse. We only have 5 receptionists in total. In a busy town with a lot of er - how would you call it - foot traffic*

Loads of people have thrown the towel in since I started. I’ve lost count now. 11? Maybe more? I’ve had sweaty ass hands since day 1. They will not stop sweating - which I’m not known for. Full-on, hyper anxiety and I can’t explain why. 

I’ve cried and I have had panic attacks before and/or during every shift since Boxing Day. I haven’t even been able to take my 30 minute break - which is literally a legal requirement. It’s simply not possible.

One receptionist (nights) is now working 7 days a week - which is fucking illegal.

My NYE was me working a (just under) 10 hour shift, and me curling up into a ball, in-front of the toilet bowl, wrenching my guts out - and nothing’s coming out because I haven’t eaten since 12pm. It’s 2am now (which I probably shouldn’t be doing because I have a health condition. It’s been flaring up like a bitch anyway so I don’t think I can make it much worse). My throat hurts. I feel useless. Fucking hopeless and suffocated. My other half has no sympathy for me because I’m not assertive enough; but I don’t understand how I’m supposed to just fuck off for my half hour break when I can just about scrape 30 seconds to grab some water or a cup of tea - and even if I do that, I’ll still have guests to serve when I come back - which, again, I love the job - but I just need *five minutes!* Before you ask, we don’t have a concierge. 

The better half won’t let me quit until I find something else - fair play - but idec at this point! I have enough savings to tide us over for a month or two. It sounds worth it at this rate, even though it would be a massive shame to lose it. That’s not what that is money is for lol. It’s a miracle if I leave an hour past my shift now. I’m averaging 10 now. My health can’t keep up with it. Felt like I was going to faint twice this week.

I’m simply not equipped to deal with this, and I’ve been left on my own, despite not being adequately trained (or paid… the shit I’m putting up with for the wages they’re paying me is just insulting at this point). Even my duty manager is struggling. Is this normal? Is this how most hotels do things?


I am at fucking breaking point.

It’s a 12-8 shift, so I still have time to get drunk before midnight after I clock out, and hey, that’s a FDA’s life for you (yo ho, yo ho! and a bottle of rum). 

This couple comes into the lobby to wait for the elevator to go back to their room. I kindly inform them that they’re going to have to wait a while, because their delightful spawn just ran in the elevator a few seconds prior and proceeded to hit all of the elevator buttons. « Have children, they said », the mother groans, and I nod sympathetically. Up to this point, I like these people. 

Then the husband chuckles, turns to me, and there it is, the single best joke of 2021. The year topper. 

« You’re lucky you’re working, you don’t have to worry about what to do tonight! » 

Guys, I don’t say this very often (because it’s lame), but. LOL. My sides still hurt from all the laughing. Such wit. Such cleverness. Such originality.

To all of you fellow hotel workers who are going to have to hear this joke tonight, and other kind internet strangers, happy new year. May the night be uneventful and the drunkards few. Long live this sub, which has entertained me on many a boring afternoon shift, and may the guests of 2022 be a little less annoying than those of 2021.",24,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEFA1FD0>

610,"""Can you do a better rate?""","So I allowed a guest to check in 12 hours early. Now usually we would charge half the rate 1/2 the rate for this room would be $183. But I was gonna charge him $150. And he has the audacity to ask me for a better rate. 

I'm like, ""Sir, you're checking in 12 hours before normal check in time, be glad I'm not charging you the full rate."" He gives me that you're gonna talk to me like that look, and I just stare back at him not budging. 

He tells me to hold on while he checks with his buddy. More like to transfer funds to his card that has .10 to his name. He comes back and I check him in authorize his card for $200, $50 for the incidentals he's a ota reservation of course, and $150 for the early check in fee. Give him his keys and off he goes. 

But I don't understand why people think they're so entitled like that, I had told them we were sold out the only reason I had any room was because of the No Shows. And then to ask for a better rate....🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️",130,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEFA10D0>
611,Mistakes are opportunities to grow,"Earlier this evening, I (MOD) alongside one of my newest GSA were vibing and holding down the fort if you will. 

Lately, with staffing shortages, we've had to task our PM Houseman to clean up any rooms that AM HSKP could not clean. Since our houseman was cleaning rooms this evening, I tasked myself to deliver guest items on top of trying to finish EOY (Payroll, invoices, etc). My GSA has been with us for about 6 months now and very much capable of running a PM shift with little MOD assistance. Today was no exception since we had a little under 32 arrivals between the two of us. I told him the ship was his to sail. 

At around 7PM, I stepped off the desk to deliver a handful of items, when I get a call on the radio to come assist at the desk. I made my way down there and was met by an irate man saying he was placed in a King when he booked a 2-Queen room. I saw the confirmation and he clearly did book a 2-Queen room. Housekeeping didn't finish all their doubles, so I was hoping a mistake had been made by the booking company. I looked at the name and noticed there were two guests with identical last names (unique last names, might I add). So I asked if they were traveling with another party, to what they responded with ""yes, our cousins are here."" It didn't take long to put two and two together and I owned up to a mistake being made and said ""it looks like we gave your cousin your room and you have theirs."" I noticed that it had been about 5-minutes since both parties checked in because they were traveling together. I looked at the couple and said ""I am sure we can ask your cousins to switch rooms, since you both just checked in."" Then the wife lost it and said ""clearly, you don't know what you're doing! Why don't you call them and ask since you f--d up! For G-d's sake, we're tired and we left our children stranded up on a floor with our luggage to come deal with this!"" The husband then chimes in ""This is a terrible start! Worst experience ever! Where do I file a complaint?!"" 

I pause and let a flood of thoughts go through my head, starting with:
1 - Your children are NOT stranded. They have access to you, all they have to do is take a lift down to lobby level.
2 - You're grown people, capable of making decisions, and you chose to leave your children unsupervised. Don't displace your negligence on me.  
3 - We can remedy this right away, no need to file a complaint and if you do it just comes back to me. 

I looked at the guy and said ""sir, we can remedy this right away, again I apologize for our oversight, let me call your cousins and explain to them what happened, I will even give them a complimentary upgrade."" I called the cousins and they were a complete 180 to this couple, they even got a laugh and said ""we were wondering why we have two beds instead of one"" they were also appreciative of the upgrade. I proceeded to tell the couple this, and the wife immediately demanded her new keys, which I happily handed over. But then, the husband made such a repulsive remark, one that I did not appreciate. He said ""how does he even have a job, he shouldn't work here."" I saw my GSA becoming upset and stepping away. I looked at the man, and told him, firmly ""Sir, we already apologized and owned up to our mistake, they do happen, we all make them, it's part of learning and growing. Now if there's nothing further I can do for you, you may proceed to your room, I'm sure your children are waiting."" Off they went, entitled and grumpy as can be mumbling ""...terrible"" and nodding their heads. 

Moments later, I approached my GSA and asked if he was okay. He turned red, and realized his mistake. I coached him on best practices and got him off the desk for the next hour so he could reflect and deliver guest requests. At the end of his shift, he was in better spirits. Not only did the time away help him clear his head, but the guests he delivered items for were generous and kind. He walked away with a box of chocolates and $20+ in tips. I told him not to take the guys comments to heart, mistakes are opportunities to grow. The couple was being dramatic and if I could get away with it, I would've told them to kiss my a--!

612,Fkng gm,"So the other day, my gm calls me and asks if I mention incidentals when guests call to inquire about prices. I said that yes, what i say is that our rate is x, with tax it will be y, and that we hold z for incidentals. 

She told me just say the rate. 


And if someone pays for the room and doesn't have money for the incidentals they never knew about to not refund them and not let them stay. 

Fuck that unethical shit.  You will always know what you will pay and why the 10 bucks extra is better than booking with suxpedia 

And btw, those of you who book ota, please stfu about incidentals.  One thing otas do well is mention incidentals.  And if you don't have enough, you should have called and asked.  Always before you book ask if there are incidentals, how much,  and if you can pay cash or only card",38,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEFA1400>
613,Flowers stored in the fridge,"In the middle of my shift I decide to take a break and make a sandwich for myself in the kitchen. By hotel policy we are allowed to make food for ourselves respecting all the HACCP hygiene rules, fair enough. Every time I clean my hands and I use gloves as well, maybe is too much but I do my best to respect procedures and rules. Anyway I open one of the big fridges where the bread is stored with vegetables and fruits, separated of course and surprise surprise ... what do I find in it ? A trolley full of flowers for the following day wedding. Seriously ? We do our best to keep high hygiene standards and after you find a f****** trolley full of flowers close to vegetables and food. Please feel me, I'm not asking a lot but come on ! Since when we are allowed to store flowers in a fridge with food.

614,"Dude, I do not know you","Had a guy come and check in two rooms. No problem there. As I was checking him in, another guy walks in, asking to use the bathroom. I pointed him to where it is and continued checking in the guest. The guest then goes outside and the other guy comes back from the toilet asking which room the other guy was in. I explained I was not able to do so and he protested saying it should have been obvious since he ""walked in with them.""

1. No, you fucking didn't. You came in after and hung behind. Maybe if you had interacted with your coworkers, I would have known.

2. The other guys are wearing matching outfits. You, sir, look like you just came off the street.

4. Call the guest who reserved and get the info you need from them. Or would you like me to give directions and keys to anyone who literally asks ""which room did you just put that guy in?""


 Guests, before you start copping an attitude when we don't give you the room number of a guest or tell you if a guest is there, stop to think about how you would feel if we willingly gave out your info to people you have not approved with us.


Or better yet, call the cellphone.

615,"Pack and Play, pt 2","So I've posted before about how I'm from an area where 'pack 'n play' means something that comes WAY before 'baby crib'. I'm used to that meaning a thing that a person wears to pack (as in have a masculine bulge in their trousers) and play (as in sexual activities involving penetration).   


Had  guest come in and say that he was promised a pack 'n play, so why wasn't it in his room...  


The person who came in behind him saw me hesitate and cough, and began to laugh (i assume because she knew what definition of pack 'n play I was jumping to).  


We do not have baby cribs here, that I can find (and I definitely hit every hospitality closet we have, looking for one for this poor lad)

616,Pop! Pop! Pop!,"First time posting here, but I feel I have to vent somewhere as my nerves are off the charts lately.

I work at an extended stay hotel, which luckily, is off the beaten path from a lot of businesses. We are mostly surrounded by apartments, a few car dealerships, and a Starbucks, of course.

My hospitality company has one other hotel in the area, our sister property, same hotel type, about a 45 minute drive from us. Our sister property was just involved in a shooting and unfortunately, the person working the front desk that night, passed away due to injuries. We've been asked to help while they shut down current reservations and process the trauma. It sounds like most of the front desk there don't want to return, which come on! Who would want to?! I'm hesitant to send my people there too, including myself.

I just dealt with a guest in August, who started to verbally sexually assault me, almost broke my hand, and ended up getting shot in our lobby with a beanbag gun after wrestling with two men in our lobby. I constantly carry pepper spray and a tazer after that incident. I've been on edge since then and this news about our sister property brought even more stress an fear of the desk.

We've had other various situations, where cops were called weekly, people with warrants, and two cops almost getting run over in the parking lot, but the incident in August hit home. Also, no, we have never had security and nothing changed after all of those incidents.

Last night, I was on the phone with my night auditor, when I heard 4 rapid succession, ""POP!POP!POP!POP!"" My night auditor said to hold on, ""Something was going on."" I told her to get into the back office now and deadbolt the door. She had set the phone on the counter, where I heard several more of those popping sounds in quick succession. I called 911 and rushed over there.

I got there about 10 minutes after and went inside once the police cleared everything and gave me the okay. My night auditor was fine, thank the Lord. The only thing the cops found, was footprints on our glass outside our lobby area, as well as several broken pieces of glass. The cops stated it appeared someone had been kicking the glass and throwing rocks at it. A guest that was outside at the time mentioned they saw and heard a truck peel away around the same time.

So, the cops said it could have been a transient or angry ex-patron throwing rocks... They dismissed the possibility of a vehicle peeling-out because one of the cops stated they were on scene without only a few minutes. So, they wouldn't miss a truck, but also found no signs of a person at all... The sounds I heard on the phone were too quick and even to be one person throwing rocks and kicking at a window.

Regardless, I'm rattled. I've only been doing this for 4 years, but this past 2 years has brought out the absolutely batshit crazy in people.",7,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEFA1160>
617,Idiot nearly gets arrested,"So i have a vague recollection of this one its been a while since its happened. The desk was busy and there was a bit of a line forming so im just focused on getting people checked in and this skinny guy with arm tattoos and black hair comes up to the desk looking a little sketchy and asks me about what room he was staying in. I try to gather some info from him which he was unable to provide for some reason and with the lobby backing up i turned back to working on guests and he kinda just disappeared into the breakfast room which has access to the backrooms and kitchen.

After a few minutes i kinda look around and hes gone, I finished checking people in and looked at the cameras and don't see anything, I think whatever he probably just left. No, guests show up in the lobby saying theres someone knocking on doors up and down the hall and guess who that was. Dumbass went through the back and into the hallways to try to figure out where someone was so I call the cops. He didn't even have to go through the backrooms theres a door in the back of our lobby.

Fast forward to this guy sitting in a room with 3 cops and a handful of guest complaints against him and he finally decides to give me enough info to figure out that he was staying with his brother in one of our rooms. Ring him up and tell him whats going on and he tells me to toss him out if we want to and rightfully confirming my thoughts that this dude is a headass. 

I apologize to the police, send the guy onto his room and place him on the DNR list and call it a day. But seriously he could have avoided this if the guy would have just talked to me more than he did.",12,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEFA15B0>
618,We don't take Apple Pay (Or: Thrown under the bus by a coworker who accepted it),"*Usual disclaimer: All names mentioned are aliases for narrative purposes and changed from actual names for privacy reasons.*

This tale is mainly dedicated to other folks who work in retail and also have to deal with ""Your coworker let me do this last time!!""-isms.

So it's about 3 AM when someone calls to rent a room.

> **Caller (henceforth Jacques Ashwhole):** How much for a room tonight?
>
> **Me:** That'll be blah before taxes, blahblah after taxes, plus we need a credit card or debit card under your name for a $50 security deposit that gets released after you check out.
>
> **Jacques:** I don't have my card with me. I only have Apple Pay.
>
> **Me:** We don't take mobile pay. It has to be a physical cred or deb card bearing your name.
>
> **Jacques:** But you took it last time!
>
> **Me:** Last time? What is your first and last name so I can look up your last res?
>
> **Jacques:** Jacques Ashwhole.

So I look up Jacques's previous and only res in our property management system, which appears to be a walk-in or a call-in judging by the res type, and I look at the card details. No cardholder name. Which was violation enough. I log into our credit card payment system, and look up the transaction by card number.

Sure enough, the type of card used was classified as ""Contactless or mobile wallet"". Indeed, that means he paid with Apple Pay. On the shift that Jacques checked in, we had Trey Tor, a fellow front desk agent from our sister property the Cave Inn, working the front desk because at the time we were shortstaffed and needed backup from sister properties so that us FDAs at the M2 Motel don't have to work overtime. We're part of a regional chain of about 8 hotels in the area, not some big-name franchise like Hiltwothousandpounds or Merryaught.

Now I can understand Trey slipping up with some of our more minor policies (like cleaning checklists and producing internal reports) because they may be different between properties and Trey had only been working for about 4 months, but in our chain, one of our universal policies is that when we accept cards, they must be physical cards bearing the guest's name, or if it's someone else's name, that someone else needs to be present and also present ID. This means no mobile pay, no nameless prepaid gift cards from the local drugstore, and no using the card of the guest's spouse who's at home 300 miles away. Like listen, I love using mobile pay, but I will not attempt to force it on a worker whose store does not allow it.

Anyways, back to Mr. Ashwhole-

> **Me:** Yes, I can see that my coworker accepted Apple Pay. However, my coworker was in violation of policy, which states that we do not accept Apple Pay or any other form of smartphone pay.
>
> **Jacques:** But you took it last time!! 2 of your coworkers did!
>
> **Me:** I'm sorry, but I am not accepting it this time. I am not risking my job because one of my coworkers ~~is an asspiper who~~ didn't follow the rules.
>
> **Jacques:** *(hangs up)*

Thanks a lot Trey. See what happens when one employee makes an exception when it comes to these sorts of significant policies involving money? The guest will try to use that as leverage when they try to do business with another employee, who must now choose between also risking trouble for breaking policy in the same way, or making the front desk look like a bunch of quabbling inconsistent little shits because Employee A allowed a thing while Employee B didn't.

Anyways thank you for calling the M2 Motel, no we don't have room gadgets. How may I help you today?",109,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEFA14F0>
619,"ID name / card name don't match? Too bad, so sad...buhbye!!","This is a short one for tonight....

Just had a guy come in, asking if we had rooms available, and being a slow Wednesday night, I tell him I do have rooms available. I quote him the rate and he's fine with it, so I begin the check-in process. I ask him for his ID and method of payment, which he hands to me. I check the name on the card against the name on the ID and see they don't match, so I tell him I can't accept the card. He tells me it's his company's card and the name on it is his boss. I once again tell him that I can't accept the card since the name doesn't match his ID. He then asks if it's an ""Illinois thing."" I tell him that it's our policy here, in an effort to prevent credit card fraud. I can tell he's getting upset, and then he pulls out the race card. ""You're doing this because I'm black, right?"" ""No sir, it's our policy"" I tell him again. He then wants to know if we have that in writing. ""Actually sir, we do."" We have a list of hotel policies posted at our front desk and numero uno on the list is name on card MUST match guest's ID (yes, 'must' is capitalized and in a larger, bold font).

620,"Should’ve quit, might still.","So I’ve pretty much had it at my hotel and hospitality in general. My latest issue is how my hotel is handling the vaccine requirements. All employees must be vaccinated by Jan 5th. Or they can’t be scheduled for shifts. Like most hotels we are short staffed, I have one FDA that will not get vaccinated and has gotten a exemption approved by owner. Therefore they have to get tested and show a negative test every Tuesday by 2pm. (Their first shift of every week starts on Tuesday). If they don’t bring the test they are immediately taken off that schedule. As FOM I will be required to cover all their shifts, which means a week of doubles with essentially no notice. So every week I’ll have a giant question mark on my schedule. 

Seriously over it but I have a family to take care of and bills to pay. Every time I start looking for a new job it feels hopeless. Don’t want another hotel but don’t want to start at the bottom doing something new.

UPDATE: So the employee didn’t read the fine print that said they must pay for the test themselves. That apparently doesn’t work for them but they still refuse to get the vaccine. My GM gave me a new schedule that has myself and other employee working 6 days next week and himself only working 4 days. I want to just quit but I don’t want to eff over the other FDA’s that will have to pick up even more.",35,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEFA17C0>
621,Need some advice about Common complaint,"OK so if you’ve been in the hotel business as long as I have you all have come across one of these guests they are the most common scams or whiny complaints but I’m still at a loss for words every time I come across them what is your advice for these following scenarios please share any experiences are good comebacks you have for them thank you in advance

Guest one has stayed with us for four days we’ve moved her four times and every single room she has a problem with it now this current room is completely flooded which probably happen because she stuff the shit out of the toilet with paper Deliberately because she wants some money back what is your argument when it’s deliberate to get discounts (but you can’t tell them you know this)

Guest 2 stayed two weeks ago and now she’s calling about oh let’s just say blood on the wall and now she wants more than $50 off and she didn’t get to call earlier because she was busy
 
Guest three said they checked out and left their wallet in the room with $500 in it and hasn’t accused any of us stealing yet but will not go away and it’s been an hour bullshitting with them what do you tell them

Guest four has been in room for five hours and now they’re saying that they haven’t been there the room is smelly horribly not satisfactory etc etc and they want their full refund 

Guest five is having a meltdown because we don’t take cash deposits but they are capitalizing on the fact that they called and the front desk said they needed a deposit but didn’t specify The payment type needed for a deposit so basically emphasize on a little wordage to place blame on us how do you deal with that?

Guest six or person six is claiming one of our guests is epileptic and not answering calls so we need to let this stranger get into the room to check on them and we’re going to get sued or blamed for someone’s death if we don’t

These Issues are so common and I’m just curious what y’all say to them? Every time I’ve handled a situation with pizzazz it was from repeating somebody else’s example I love the sub Reddit thanks you guys",31,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEFA1730>
622,How a 5 minute check in turned into 40 minutes of drama.,"I’m not a receptionist , but am an airline captain. I guess it would be no surprise for anyone that I stay at hotels for business purposes, a lot actually. 

Today was one of those days, me and another captain (my senior) were scheduled to stay at this hotel for the night and we’re doing some legs of flight from the airport nearby tomorrow. 

From the moment we stepped in I knew he was gonna be an a-hole because you see, the receptionist saw us walking in and kindly put the check-in forms on the desk with a couple of pens. What did this guy do? He started complaining loudly as he walks about how much paper that is to fill (it was mostly just information with a couple lines for the guest to fill in). 

Then he walks straight to the receptionist and tells him that he stayed here a billion times before and they already had his information so what was the point of him filling the forms again. They tell him that it’s mandatory to do so each time, and he does as told but still complaining for everyone to hear. While I’m there next to him, with my “I’m embarressed to be seen with this person but I don’t have anywhere to run so please tolerate us” smile just trying to write fast as I can and leave. I also don’t understand how he doesn’t see the point because first of all they don’t have to recognise you or know that you’ve stayed there before, and secondly the information they require may very well change. Like your phone number and e-mail doesn’t have to stay the same for the rest of your life, right?

Just as I think we’re done with it he states he forgot his phone in his car, so he doesn’t have his health safety code. In my country quarantining is mandatory in case of testing positive so the government monitors everyone by assigning each person a safety code, it is a qr code with some random string of numbers attached to it. While entering any public place like a restaurant, hotel or shop you either show your qr code to a camera of a phone the workers have, or you tell them your numbers attached so they can type it into the system and check your covid status. If your code shows you’re a high risk person and you won’t be accepted in. If you do somehow get in, both you and the business gets hit with a huge fine so everybody takes it seriously. 

Him and the poor receptionist stood there looking at each other before he continued “What are you gonna do now, not accept me in?” I saw the look in receptionist’s eyes wanting to say “Of f**ing course I won’t”. But I also know he would never say it out loud because usually airlines are good customers for the hotels, even when we’re discounted for the rooms, so he wouldn’t risk arguing with him and taking the chance of dealing with the airline. He just said “But I have to check your code, or I will risk my job”. This went on for a while with the captain getting angrier and louder each time and the receptionist just holding his frustration in and repeating the same things.

At some point I knew this wouldn’t go anywhere so I suggested there surely must be a way to learn someone’s status and the code online and me and the receptionist just started to look for it online. He then gave us his national ID in case we need it and basically said you guys deal with it while I make a phonecall out of the reception’s phone. 

When we found his code I wrote it on a piece of paper and told him to put it in his wallet so in case this ever happens he won’t be such a pain to deal with.

And by the way, while the receptionist was trying to give me his short briefing about the hotel like restaurant service, laundry, etc. he was still on the phone, loudly, next to me and interrupted us several times. So just because of that I had to call reception three times to ask things they’ve already told me about.  I know this is a busy hotel with only 2 people working the front desk but I honestly didn’t understand a word of receptionist’s briefing and I needed answers.

While we were done and ready to go up to our rooms, he was still complaining how unnecessary all of that was, how hot the hotel is, how this and that…They just wished us a happy stay with a smile so we’d go on our merry ways.

I gained high respect for anyone that could deal with that BS with a straight face.",98,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEFA1850>
623,Oh I'm rude for following up with you?,"A British tw@t yesterday almost made me walk out. 

We'll call him Mr. Brittwat.

I get in at 10am to my Concierge desk yesterday. FD lets me know Mr. Brittwat needs a car service to take him to a big city 2 1/2 hours away today, Wednesday. Less than 24 hours notice. I'm a Concierge. My job is to make magic happen.

Within a half hour I have a confirmation and a rate of $450 for the transport. I call him on his international phone and he answers but can't hear me. Oh well.

Around noon, Mr. Brittwat stops by my desk. I tell him I tried to call him but he couldn't hear me on his phone, but I have the rate of $450. He tells me he'll let me know later that day since that's a steep price. I gave him Amtrak as a cheaper option which he declined. I told him due to this being within 24 hours, I'd need a confirmation from him ASAP as the service has other orders they're turning down waiting for a confirmation from him. He walks away telling me he'll let me know ""within the hour.""

5pm rolls around. Still no confirmation from him 5 hours later. My car company is e-mailing and calling me telling me they can't hold the service past 6pm (I'm leaving at 5:45pm anyway so I want to get this taken care of too).

I call Mr. Brittwat in his room. No answer. I call him on cell. No answer. I e-mail him and get an out-of-office reponse. No answer. 

Finally, I call him one last time at 5:35pm, 10 minutes before I leave. He UNLEASHES on me that he was on an important Zoom meeting and his girlfriend was sleeping and I was incredibly rude for bugging him. I apologize, if I can even get a word in, and explain I had no idea I was interrupting him. Without even getting the chance to explain WHY I'm calling him, he continues to verbally tongue lash at me. 

Finally I ask him if he wants the car service. He screams ""NO!"" and slams the phone down. He spoke to my manager this am before I got in and got a bunch of stuff comped because I ruined his stay. 

Things have been so bad at my hotel. I'm not getting holiday pay these holidays because I was ""rehired"" after the pandemic and still waiting 90 days and I'm off unpaid next week 8 days due to low occupancy. Also stuff is being stolen out of my concierge desk nightly and as much as I bitch to management they don't care. 

All this shit always happens at the holidays.",29,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEFA17F0>
624,What an interesting first week 😵‍💫,"There’s gonna be a few small stories and things that have been said or asked in my first few weeks in the industry 🙃

Just to put you in the setting, I work in one of many hotels in a small collage town. About 100 rooms, not even. 💀 I’m one of two night auditors. 

One of the first nights of training, we had this person come in with their family. Nothing out of the ordinary. Well they came back down, asked if there was any dispensaries here. My co-worker didn’t know what he was talking about but I was like 💀 oh shit he doesn’t know. He clarified himself by saying “ya know. Weed.” I kinda giggled a little because it’s illegal here and you’d think that you’d see if the state you’re going to has restrictions on it or not. So I told him “sir. It’s illegal here.” He was shocked to say the least haha then asked us if either of us smoked it. I was honest and said yes 🤡 (dumbass I know). He looked at me, held up his blunt and said “well you’re welcome to join me outside to smoke this.” Of course I politely declined but I went home with a good laugh. 


First week working alone 🙃 We had a bunch of cops from the surrounding counties coming in to do training at the academy we have here in town. One walked in pretty drunk, walked up to the front desk and asked me “do you want a drink?” I was super confused so I kept tilting my head and saying what 😂 he drunkenly replied with “ya know like a drink 😉 I can get you one. What you want? I’ll go across to the bar and come back” he kept going but I kinda just blocked it out. Kept saying “no thank you. We’re not supposed to receive things from guests.” Asked me my name (we don’t have name tags) so I told him, said it was “beautiful”. (This was the point where he was weirding me out) He had a sober friend there who (thank god) helped me a little. Told him “she’s working dude. Let it go.” So he did and then went to talk to the rest of the cops in the lobby. I was bored so I listened to the convo. Talked about some women that assaulted him (?), court for that,  and the fact that he would never go down on a woman. Big oof. He then comes over to buy something from the little market we have. Just chips, candy and soda. He started asking about the snacks like price and what he could pay with. Proceeded to ask “are you hungry? Want doordash?” Again had to decline. Even more “you sure? I don’t mind.” Then “are you married?” Like where did that even come from???? So I was honest (I’m a dumbass I know) told him “no” and he replied with “should be” …… 🤡 what?
 I just want to thank what ever luck I had because he was staying for two weeks but I never saw him again 🙏🏻",29,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEFA1580>
625,Stories from a Long term Hotel Guest,"Few years ago, I lived in a hotel for work purposes, for three and a half months. I was polite to all the workers, and left a raving review that called out people for their amazing service. A lot of these stories on this sub resonate with me, because I saw a lot of the fuckery you guys unfortunately deal with first hand. This all was in the fall of 2019 in Virginia, on a beach front property with all rooms having a view of the ocean

1) After noticing people were complaining about their rooms not being ready, told the front desk to tell house keeping I'm the last priority. I'm a grown man, perfectly capable of keeping my room clean. Just check on trash once in a while. Apparently that helped out quite a bit. 

2) Kept losing my key (card) because I'm a moron, and more than once watched the front desk get belittled. One struck a nerve with me, after the person and family left, told the girl ""Okay that woman is a bitch, fuck her. You're doing an amazing job"" 

3) Concert series played on beach, got to walk and see one of my favorite bands play live. Spent the other two nights drinking on the patio jamming to the other bands i could hear perfectly. 

4) Learned a bit about how the room locked work, didn't realize those things ran on batteries until one day I couldnt get into my room. Turns out the battery had died and watched the dude replace it. 

5) Had to evacuate to Richmond due to a hurricane. Get checked into another hotel, open the room and there is another individuals stuff on it. (err what?) - Went back down, explained what was going on, got a new room, life good. Watched more people be annoyed with hotel staff but c'mon dude - hurricane! We're all fucked here and I know stress is high but relax, you're safe now. 

6) Upon return to original hotel room, see that room got affected by strong winds and rain. (patio door), need a temporary change of room Switched rooms, next day another fiasco happens but good news is original room is ready to go. Cool!

7) Had to shove a piece of furniture in front of the locked door because high winds of another hurricane kept vibrating it making a shit ton of noise. (Also, cmon! Two hurricanes!?)

8) Watched three different groups check in throughout my stay and all the shit shows that go with large bookings. 

9) Again, I'm chill with the front desk, so one time they asked me to casually check out a suspicious vehicle in the parking garage. No big deal, confirm it looks suspicious. Dude asks me to hold the fort down (aka tell anyone who shows up front desk will be make in a minute) as he checks it himself. He didn't notify the police or anything. 

10) Finally check out day occurs, but I have a late flight. Politely ask if I can do a late check out, they told me I could check out any time, I've been great to them. 

11) Got top tier awards program, and gotta admit - these programs are over glorified and so not worth the effort it takes to get it. So when I read these shiny award members program stories, I just roll my eyes - dude, if you stay at these places so often, you of all people should have some patience and respect. 

12) Got trapped in my room due to two marathons that blocked the road and garage 

13) Became a regular at way too many tourist restaurants and bars that started giving me the local hookup 

Great times. Thank you for all you do.",54,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEFA1640>
626,Entitled Parents Love Using Their Kids As Emotional Ammunition.," I just had a woman come in, apparently she decided to take a ""last minute vacation with her kids"", she failed to get a hotel before she left, figuring she could just get a hotel when she got here.

She's checked ""every hotel on the island"" and in the town across the bridge, everything is booked the week before New Years. We are also booked, very booked Christmas and New Years are booked solid months in advance Despite this, apparently it's my fault that her children have nowhere to sleep, and she's not leaving until I find her a room, like invoking her kids plight will get me to get an empty room to magically appear.

My response was: ""I told you I don't have any rooms. Our sister hotel doesn't have any rooms. The only phone call I'm making is to the Sheriff if you don't leave.""

She tried to call my bluff, staring me down.........until I picked up the phone. Then she called me ""Useless"" and ""Fucking incompetent""............as she was getting into an elevator to leave. 

Moral of the story; If you are taking a ""last minute"" vacation the week before a major holiday that falls on a weekend, make sure you can find a hotel first.",113,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEFA15E0>
627,"Oh, That's NOT what eCheck-in Means!","Happy Merry Holly Jolly to all my fellow FDA's during this busy hotel season. May your shifts be swift and your guests be invisible for the duration of their stays.   
My hotel is a \~100 room property in the US and during the holiday season we generally sell out every night.

I get a call tonight from a woman asking for me to take a look at her reservation, she tells me she had eChecked-in online and wanted me to verify that it had gone through for the room she had picked. I asked her what date the reservation is for, and she said its for tomorrow. 

The way eCheck-in works for our property is that guests in the loyalty program can eCheck-in to their upcoming reservations to preselect their preferred room, and approve their preferred credit or debit card for the stay, up to 2 days in advance of their check-in day. We can't 100% guarantee that the room they select will be the one they end up in on the day of check-in, but generally unless its an emergency we won't change the room number for an eCheck in. Its just a way of telling the hotel what locations you prefer for your stay, and it makes check-in on the day of arrival faster as you only need to show your ID at the desk because you already approved the charges on your card during eCheck-in. Guests can also opt in to get their room key to be sent to their phone if they have the app and bypass the front desk altogether if they so choose.

I pull it up her reservation and tell her that I can see that she has eChecked into the room she selected. She then says ""so no one will be in that room tonight, correct?"" I ask her for some clarification as I have her check-in date set for tomorrow, not tonight. She says ""Yes we're arriving tomorrow, but I don't want anyone in the room tonight."" I told her unless she were to extend her reservation out to pay for both tonight and tomorrow night we could not guarantee that room would remain vacant for the night. She replied ""Why would I pay for tonight, I'm not coming in tonight, I'm arriving tomorrow!"" I told her then we were likely to sell the room tonight to another guest with a 1 night reservation who would check out in the morning and the room would be made ready for her arrival in the afternoon.

""But I eChecked in! I'm already Checked into the room! How can someone else rent it!?""

This...This woman really BELIEVED that eChecking-in the day before her arrival would make it so that no one else who checked in tonight would be able to get that room. I explained to her what I have explained above about how an eCheck-in actually works and that without payment for the room for tonight we were close to selling out and likely someone would be in that room for the evening. 

She did NOT like that and starting telling me that we absolutely CANNOT let someone else be in the room tonight. She listed a variety of reasons, from Covid to her allergies, as to why we couldn't rent it to anyone tonight and asked me if there was a way for ME to make sure no one would be in that room. I told her we clean and sanitize our rooms with hospital-grade equipment after check out and that I can make a note to the housekeepers to make the room Allergen-Free but that was the extent of what I could do. I can't turn away a paying guest from an empty room she hadn't paid for. She replied ""Well...if that's ALL you can do for me...then you do that."" I told her I had made the note and wished her a good evening and then we ended the call. 

I guess to some degree I can understand being confused about how someone can check into a room tonight that you already digitally checked into, but surely after putting a little thought into it, it would occur to her that we don't just let future guests hold rooms empty overnight without payment? What's odd to me is she didn't seem to want to check into the room early tomorrow morning, or at least she made no mention of it to me, or seem to be trying to get a free night. She just seemed to want no one in the room at all the day before she arrived? But I guess that's just part of working a hotel Front Desk: There are some things guests do that I will simply never understand!",34,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEFA1A90>
628,"Oh, We Should Comp You?","We just had a lovely gentleman come in, believing that he booked a room with us last night. Apparently, this is the type of guy who gets his wife to book his rooms for him. That's all well and good, but there was some confusion. He comes in to check in, but his name is nowhere to be found, so we asked if he had a confirmation number. So, he calls his wife... and my God. I don't know how someone like this could be married to such a nice guy.

She starts off saying that she spoke to a woman yesterday, and got pretty close to the name of one of the two women who work the front desk here. The problem? Neither of the women who worked here were on last night. I worked last night, and definitely didn't speak with this lady. 

Her husband handed me the phone (before this, I just heard the conversation, because she's borderline screaming on the phone), and she **starts** with ""You need to compensate my husband, and his mother with a room! Because I called you yesterday, and there's no way in hell or high water that I would've sent my husband there without a reservation! And, *she*  (I guess the ghost of a cursed woman who worked alongside me last night) charged me $69, because it's a funeral rate!"" At that point, I had to cut her off. Our bereavement rate is $98, so I told her that, and explained that she'd booked at the wrong hotel, and she complained that she couldn't get through on the phone yesterday. Which is it, you called and booked, or were you the person who kept hanging up when I had to put your calls on hold, because my primary job is to check the people in front of me in?

Anyway, her husband actually just ended up hanging up on her, saying that there was no point to this. I kind of feel bad for him. We have some rooms that are DNR for no real reason, and I could've opened one up, but not after being talked to like that.",16,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEFA19D0>
629,"When the guest doesn't understand ""no"" and neither does management","That guy comes in for a few hours (nudge nudge) and has been a guest for years. Strangely, he mostly shows up when we're booked full. 

That day, we're in the middle of the Christmas Markets season, the busiest time of the year and he shows up.
I tell him no.

But just for a few hours.

Still no.

Are you sure.

Yes.

He goes to leave and suddenly goes for the stairs.

I just can't believe it and stay dumbfounded for a minute or so.
When I get to the first floor he's talking to one of our housekeepers and offering her cash to sneak in a room, do his business and then she'll re-do the room!

I (almost literally) kick him out and off to the DNR list he goes. 

After my days off, I find out our manager's knowingly took him off the list because ""he brings in good money"". 
She's basically given him permission to walk all over us for money. Maybe this covid business is the time to move away from hospitality after all.",51,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEFA1BB0>

So I used to work at a [redacted], but quit the job in February of 2020. (Could’ve stayed one more month and got unemployment for months😖)

Okay so Im working the night shift and a very nice big lady comes in and we’re chatting and shes telling me shes from the south and she had a long plane ride. Etc etc. Then she deadass pulls popeyes chicken out of her purse and offers me some. Like it wasn’t in any wrapping. Just raw dogging the inside of her purse. But yeah I took that cold purse chicken and I ate it. She tells me she put the popeyes chicken in her purse for the plane ride.

631,"""My toilet overflowed a little bit.""","Christmas night I had to work a 12 hour shift due to the regular evening FDA coming down with COVID the day prior. The day shift clerk worked 6am to 6pm, with me taking over at 6pm. I was operating on very little sleep, but thankfully the shift had been slow and uneventful, so I was able to rest/relax in the back office.....until about 3:45am. 

The phone hadn't rang in hours, so I was a little startled when it rang from an in house call. I answer and the guest apologizes for calling, but said he had to because his toilet had overflowed ""a little bit."" I tell him that there's no need to apologize and that I can come up with a mop/bucket and a plunger and have him good to go in no time.

I gather up what I need and head up to his room. Once I get into the bathroom, I turn to him and say, ""I thought you said the toilet had overflowed just a little bit."" A mop and bucket was NOT going to cut it for that job. There was water, and poop, all over the freakin' floor. I asked him how many times he flushed the toilet and he said four. Now normally I try not to raise my voice to guests, but being that I was tired, and seeing the mess I actually had to deal with kinda pissed me off. Already knowing the answer (because I have dealt with this type of stupidity before), I asked him, rather loudly/rudely why he continued to flush the toilet after the first try when it didn't go down. He replied with ""well, I was hoping it would clear on its own."" Jackass!!

What should have been a simple, five minute clean up took almost half an hour. This wasn't some old gezer who was dazed and confused, nor was it some young punk who didn't know any better, so what this guy was thinking is a mystery.

Why why why do guests think it's a good idea to keep flushing when the damn thing is plugged up and water is up to the rim? If it doesn't go down the first time, call the front desk and we'll get it taken care of or move you to a different room if it's something that can't be unplugged right away.

633,"You’re the night manager, I’m the owner!","I’m still laughing at this, happened about 10 minutes ago, I get a call from a lady asking me if I speak Spanish, kindly say no, I speak English only and then a man comes on the other end and starts talking to me in English. He is like hello, who am I speaking to, I let them know my name and he laughs and says hello P***l, you’re the night shift guy, where is your gm, so I let him know that I’m currently the gm of this property (even though we don’t have one cause it’s a small motel with 8 employees total 🤣) and his like oh ok, I’m the owner of this property and I’m expecting a package, whilst the owner of the actual property is sleeping about 20 feet away from me and I just had a conversation with the owner about 30 minutes ago about how to raise our sales. So I realize it’s one of those package scams I’ve heard about and I’m bored at work so decide to go with the flow, my mans gives me a tracking number, a payment confirmation number, he is telling me that he expects the package to be here tomorrow and I might have to send it to him since he can’t make it down to the property, and I might have to pay for it but it’s ok since I can use the cash in the cash drawer and he will reimburse it 🤣. 

He finally asks for my phone number, whilst I was on the phone with him I was texting the owner telling him what’s happening, me and him are laughing over text, and I’m like sir if you need my phone number then who have I been texting this whole time! He sounds distraught and is like I’m the owner who are you texting, so I repeat his phone number back to him (like caller ID ain’t a thing suddenly) and you can hear the panic in his voice and I kindly say “nice try jackass and hang up” shit was mad funny!

634,How room and restaurant compensation works.,"This is a guide for people who think that they get a compensation because it rained or someone was being too loud next to them, that's not how compensation works.

 Room and restaurant compensation happened because of a mess up on the property not because Joe Schmo in room 123 was being extremely loud. If you call down and complain about Joe Schmo in room 123 and we send up security and Joe Schmo does turn down the music then we did our job.

 We will not compensate somebody for not being on the side of the hotel they want or being in the room they want, If you book a king bed and we give you a double Queen bed then yes compensation will be in order. 

But because you can't be next to your daughter because you booked the day of her wedding instead of 3 months when the group rate was made and you're not getting the group rate, compensation or comp'd meal won't be offered or the room next to her. We will try to accommodate to the best of our abilities, and that's if you're being polite and understanding. If you go off on us and try to bully us, you'll be on the lowest floor next to the elevator.

Compensation only works when the hotel is at fault, or even if it's an important event like a birthday or anniversary, we may send up champagne or sundries. And if you're actor Keanu Reeves don't even expect to pay for your hotel room or anything at my property. But don't expect compensation cuz your room faces the sunrise and not the sunset, or if you're on a lower floor.",57,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEFA1670>

636,"""Sir, respectfully, I was the one that checked you in.""","I love my job, I get to make people angry for doing it how I'm supposed to.

Guest and his wife come in. The wife walks in and asks to check in but unfortunately her name isn't on the room. My front desk agent asks where her husband is and she said he's parking the car. Took the guy nearly a half hour to park his car and his wife sat on the couch waiting for him. In that time I, AGM, came in to work the desk. After check out, here's our correspondence when I got his 7/10 review. 

""Additional Feedback on Overall Stay: As stated, it was unacceptable for the clerk to not give my wife the room key card to our room and making my wife wait in the lobby until I returned to the hotel
Specific feedback about the cleanliness/working order of room: There was no toilet paper in the room, and the fridge makes a horrible noise
Example of felt cared and improvement comment: When we arrived I ask my wife [WIFE][LAST NAME] to go to front desk to get key card to our room, she had checked us in already on the [HOTEL] Aoo, while I went to park our car (I do not want valet parking, having someone in our car durning covid is not wise) When [WIFE] got to the desk she told them our names, that we were checked in, but they would not give her the room key card saying that she was not on the account. But when we made the reservation via our online account I put both our names in the system as both would be staying in the room. I don't know what happened or why but there was no reason that my wife [WIFE] should not have been able to get the key to the room. Instead she had to sit in the lobby waiting for me to return. This is unacceptable. Next the room we were given had no toilet paper and the fridge makes horrible noise""

Part of my job as AGM is to read every single review that comes in and respond if the system prompts me. Anyone that leaves something less than a 10 has to have a response (of course). This is always fun, like the time a guest gave us a 0 and when I asked why he said it's because he never recommends anything to anyone and he puts a 0 every time, thinking it's just a blank score instead of... 0/10.

I sent my response with all the courtesy and customer service that I could:

""Reply Sent: Apology

Dear Mr [GUEST]:

Thank you for completing our Guest Survey regarding your recent stay at our hotel. I apologize that your experience was anything less than satisfying.

Since I'm the AGM I also get to cover our part time audit position that is impossible to fill, so I replied to his review just before midnight and got his response while I was still on that shift at 4:10 AM.

""Subject: Re: Your stay at [HOTEL]
When I made the reservation ONLINE I put my wife’s name down as she would

I was even nice enough to screenshot his profile notes to show that I did indeed put [WIFE] down as authorized to check in. Why are you getting so mad at me when I'm just doing my job?

637,"Karen's, Kyle's, Kevin's, krakens?...","This is a post to all the hospitality industry. That includes hospitals, restaurants,  retail, railroads, anyone that has to do any customer service. 

Right now is a bad time to be in customer service, all the Karen's etc being bitches and Kyle's pranking us with phone calls and pretending to be blind and harassing others. We DONT have to stand for it. There is no more ""The customer is always right"" anymore for me. The only motto I follow is ""We refuse the right to serve you....and I will call the cops to deal with you!""

I see all these tik toks and YouTube and even news articles about people treating customer service workers like shit. I remember a video where a FDA just lost it and threw his computer because 1) the PMS wasn't working (probably awnkue) and 2) a Karen was complaining about something he had no control over, a 3rd party reservation. It's come down to us having mental breakdowns now because these idiots believe they can treat us like shit! Guess what....? They can't! Dont let them! Fight back, not with fists but with with words and even a single word, ""NO!"" I love using that word with a Karen or Kevin. 

If I have a problem with a Karen or Kyle I say no and give them my bosses card to call when he comes in at 9am, until then they can leave the property or the police will be called, and my property is literally next door to the city hall. So it takes a officer less then 5 mins to arrive. 

My point being is we don't have to deal with Karens and Kyle's, etc....! Just because the feel entitled doesn't make them entitled. And if you know your boss won't back you up especially when you're being treated poorly, leave thar toxic property or business. Right now it's a buyers market and everyone is looking for someone to work. Dont feel you have to work at a job that treats you poorly, and if you get fired, guess what at the interviews they ask why we're you fired and you tell them the truth, you stuck up for yourself while someone treated you like shit, and refused service. I've used that line in a interview I wasn't fired but I quit a job because they manager didn't stick up for his employees and wanted to save face with a Karen. 

Just remember as customer service we need to back each other up too, if you're at a Harbuicks and see a a Karen being a bitch to the person behind the counter. Tell her to stfu and order or cut in like in front of the Karen. I love doing that. And talking to the person behind the counter asking their favorite color while Karen gets pissed. And be supportive of each other on here too. Give constructive feedback don't be an asshole or give positive comments to someone, you don't know if they're having a hard time because they may work at a place where Karen's roam the area rats in a NYC subway or the management sees dollar signs instead of people.

Happy holidays to all the good people on this app, for those who need help don't be afraid to ask. We're here for each other!",40,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEFA1430>
638,Lighthearted tale: the elevator keeps calling to see what's up!,"Hardy har har! So we had the phone company come in to update our phone lines recently. So all outside calls show as coming from a room number we don't have, and about every 5-10 minutes the elevator gives us a call to see what's up!!

I guess some wires got crossed somewhere, but the only way to get it to shut up for a half hour is to wait for the elevator alert message to stop, press 2 to talk into the elevator, and then hang up. 

With the holidays, it's taking even longer for someone to come out and fix it. So this is my life now.

It's driving me absolutely bananas though and I can't wait for them to fix it. 5-10 minutes for 8 hours is ungodly.",20,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEFA13D0>
639,"Sorry Sir, I am not interested in seeing your private bits.","This happened when I was working at the Front Office Intern at a 5* Hotel somewhere in Central Europe. I was 20 years old at the time and had to do an internship. It was early in the morning that day and the breakfast restaurant was crowded with guests. So the restaurant staff asked for help from the front office to deliver a breakfast tray to a guest’s room. As I had done it a couple of times in the past, my colleague asked me to do it again. So I picked up the breakfast tray from the room service kitchen and went to deliver to the guest room. I rang the bell once I got in front of his door and I patiently waited.

I was studying for a few years in that country so I understood when he said in his language: “Just a moment please”. All of the guest’s doors had a peeping thing to look through before opening their door. I noticed he looked through it. 
Then the door opened and what was in front of me was a man with blue eyes, light brown hair, maybe around 180 centimeeters in height who might have been in his mid to late 30’s. 
His right hand was holding the door handle while his left hand was holding his towel which was wrapped around his private area. It looked like he just got out of the shower as there was still having some stream coming out of the bathroom. 

I greeted him and asked where should I place the breakfast tray in his language. Do note that we can place the breakfast tray on 3 different places in the guest room: the study table, the tea table or on the bedside table. 
Instead of answering me back with words, he let go of his left hand to point to the study table. When he did that, the towel he was holding onto had fallen to the ground. I turned my head and my eyeballs to the right to look at the empty corridor of guest rooms and said nothing with a poker face.
But of course in my mind I thought: ""No sir, I am not interested in seeing your private bits."" I also didn’t get a good look at his torso when the towel was on so I can’t really describe if he had an attractive physique. - Sorry.

He apologized with a smile while picking up the towel after seeing my uncomfortable reaction and he quickly rapped the towel back and stepped aside to let me come in. I didn’t give him any eye contact and still kept looking to the right. I could vaguely see where I was going from the corner of my eyes so once I placed the breakfast tray on the study table, I turned around and said: ""have a nice day” while still looking to the opposite side of him to not have any eye contact.

This was the first time I had experienced a situation like this. It was my first internship after all. And since then, I had experienced similar situations too but they were not as fun to tell compared to this story.",26,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEFA1490>
640,Pretty Sure I Caught Credit Card Fraud,"Long-ish post incoming.

So a little backstory, since I've been working at this hotel (6 months) there's been this man... let's call him Sam Hunter, who has consistently made last-minute reservations and no-showed. Already weird. Every time we see the name, whenever the evening staff is passing off to the Auditor, we'd say ""and Sam made a reservation again..."" knowing when 3am came around and we no-showed him, we'd charge his card, and that would be that (we've been trying to figure out what he's been up to giving us over $1000 in free money, but that's coming).

So it's Christmas Eve, and I'm covering the NA shift. The evening girl texts me at about 8pm saying ""Sam made a reservation"" I was like GREAT, I LOVE waiting until 3am until I can get the audit done. I get there at 10pm (the evening girl that night was 8 months pregnant, she asked me to come an hour early, no problem), and imagine my surprise when at 11:30, this man walks in the door and says ""hi, I'm Sam Hunter, I have a reservation."" If it wasn't for the mask, he would've seen my jaw drop. 

I go okay cool, can I just see a credit card and piece of ID. The ID looks normal, but when I tell you this is the sketchiest looking credit card I've ever seen. It was a black card with orange and red circles (like the MasterCard logo) but it just said ""Money Card."" There was no name or number on it, but when I flipped it over, there was a card number and expiration date hand-written where the signature box would usually be. Giving the guy the benefit of the doubt that this was some weird temporary card, I swiped it, but it didn't go through. 

I asked him if he had another card on him, and he said ""my girlfriend is parking the car and my wallet is in there, I'll be right back.""

By 3am, he still hadn't returned... so unless he was parking the car in New York City, he wasn't coming back. Looking into his previous reservations, I realized each reso had a different credit card number, all MasterCards. Now I know some people have more than one card, but FIVE?? My hunch is that he's been making fake cards and testing them on our hotel; each time we've charged him for a no-show, it's gone through, (side story, ONCE he tried to ""use the credit of the no-show reservation"" to stay the following night, manager said absolutely not, since he has a history of no-showing, but he was welcome to join us on a walk-in basis as we had plenty of space... he didn't take us up on that). 

So anyways, seeing the charges actually go through made him bold enough to try to use it in person, but it didn't work. To top it all off, of course this time the no-show charge didn't go through, but really, I didn't expect it to.

So... unless he's been using a fake ID and fake name this whole time, we have his name, his home address, and now we have an image of his face since he actually had the guts to try and check-in.",61,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEFA1AF0>
641,Be wary of unknown practices at your job.,"I been here for about 2 years.
I work at small hotel chain and it's slower due to winter season again.
My boss is often questionable  on what he chooses to tell us FD agents and yesterday I found  out something disturbing.

Glad to know my hard earned state money  is paying some abled body 31 year old won't get off the system and living in hotels for free daily.
We haven't taken  in a DSS case in 1 year and he thought it was a great idea to take in 1 guest recently who has covid  for 4 days ( not even sure where they did the rest of the quarrintine) without telling us.

Out of 4 FD agents, only person who did know was one FD and he has a problem keeping secrets.( he's more or less a slave since he has to live on the property while working here.)
Unfortunately for boss, that secret got to me and I'm paranoid how many he going to try to take in without  letting any of us know. 

Also best part, I'm not allowed to tell HK certain things as if roaches  were a issue before guest C/O disgusted or bed bugs.
And you can guess also this  covid room will prob be half assed cleaned when this patient for covid  leaves and no, the HK will not know.

642,Lack of a Credit Card transitions to odd Covid Conspiracies,"So, standard policy is you need to provide a credit card or we don't check in at this Duper 9.  Some folks we know personally are allowed to use a debit deposit, but those people have history with us and we know them well.

About 15 minutes ago a couple dudes (I wanna say late 30's) come in with some beer, they'd been drinking but they're not hammered or anything.  I ask for ID and a credit card, and get given a driver's license and a standard visa interact debit card.  


I apologize and say that I need a credit card.  


I get told this card is a visa card.  


Yes, but it's not a credit card I reply, it's fucking bank card you moron (that last part being in my head).  Queue about five minute of us going back and forth where he's trying to argue that this card is sufficient, he's been here a lot (spoiler his name is not in the system) , he travels the world and has never had a problem anywhere, etc.  


Then he tries telling me to take $500 as a deposit, not really getting that's it's not a certain dollar threshold that he needs to cross, it's hotel policy and I need a real fucking credit card.  Queue more arguing where he tries to tell me that cash is king (no, keeping my job by following policy is), hotels in Europe are happy to take his money, what do we need to do resolve this (how does a world traveler not have a CC?), and so on.  


Finally, he seems to get it (after asking literally the same questions multiple times and getting the same answer) and asks me to call them a cab.  I'm happy to do so, and they wait for it in the lobby because it's currently -33c with windchill.  (Why do I live where the air hurts my face?)  


So as they're sitting on the couches they start talking as friends do, and the topic shifts to Covid.  It starts out with the usual stuff, it's a man-made flu, nobody he knows has ever actually gotten Covid, the vaccines implant tracking chips, and so on.  All of this stuff is ""conditioning"" us for the ""next step,"" whatever that is.  I would have normally tuned nonsense like this out, but right then it started to get kinda interesting, and well unique.    


His buddy brought up the topic of resistance, and the other guy (who tried to pay with the debit) basically shut him down.  He basically said that sure, you've got some guns.  But at best you rebel for like a month, and then you lose your house because you're not paying your mortgage and your kids because you're not able to go out and buy groceries anymore.  Sure, you might have a .306 and a couple pistols, but the government has automatic rifles, helicopters, and cruise missiles.  What are you goona do against that?  


It was so goddamn weird listening to a conspiracy nut with like a small shred of forethought.  He was smart enough to realize that fantasies of righteous rebellion where just that, fantasy, and that defeat was inevitable, but he wasn't smart enough to just believe what basically every medical professional ever has said about the Pandemic.  


Oh, and apparently global warming is a myth because Barrack Obama bought a beachfront winery in Martha's Vineyard.  Yup.

643,Please don't try to argue with me,"So I'm doing my swing shift of night audit. It is day 2 of 2 and I am ready to go home even though I have 5 hours left of my shift. 

A little background info I work for a resort in a very touristy area right on the beach. We are completely sold out because even though it is December because, as we all know, Christmas is one of the busiest times of the year.  We only have 2 different room types on this property. We have oceanfront rooms and partial ocean views. None of our rooms don't have a view.

I just had a guest check in (at 2am) who was adamant that they booked a room directly on the beach but the reservation was sent to me as a partial ocean view which just means it's on the side of the building. I told them if they could show me a confirmation email that says oceanfront, then I would be able to change the room type but without that I can't do anything. They booked through a 3rd party reservation and I can't change anything unless they sent it to us wrong in the 1st place.

They pulled out the confirmation and it said partial ocean view. They skipped over the partial part, pointed where it says ocean view and went HA. I then had to try to explain that it says partial and I cannot upgrade them.  They then threatened to email the CEO of this massive brand and complain that I would not upgrade them to an ocean front unit for free because that's what they though they booked. 

I told them to do what they felt like they needed to do but my hands were tied and they were in the partial unit because we are sold out.

644,Pre auth request that ended in 3 separate complaints,"Had this situation a few days ago and thought I'd share. 

So I had a guy come to check in with his relatives. He seemed to be taking charge of the check-in process and all was going well until I asked for a pre-auth of 50 - I'm sure you guys know what a pre-auth is and what it is for, i hate asking for it and haven't had to at any of the other 4 hotels I've worked at. At the end of the day it's policy and I have to ask for it. 

The guest refused right away stating that he had no money on his card (really? But you're staying away?) And that this was not mentioned to him previously. I had a couple guests push back on the preauth policy before so I began trying to explain it is part of our hotel policy and covers us for incidentals and damages - if it is not used then it is returned on check out. He did not accept this at all and then starting saying to me that it was illegal to ask for this, it is not our policy and it is just me personally adding extra charges on (first of all it's a temporary hold on your account not a charge, secondly if you have no intentions of damaging the room then whats the issue?), He then started telling me that he is going to contact the owners of the company and have me fired. 

For someone new into the industry this may catch them off guard but I've had the delight of dealing with so many difficult guests, a large majority of which have threatened the same as this guy so I just tell him to proceed as he see's most appropriate. I don't think he liked my sarcasm as he then started shouting at me saying I am unprofessional and he highly doubts I'm the manager (I am infact the FOM). This was my limit so I asked him to leave, to which he refused stating only the owners of the building have a legal right to ask him to leave or some crap. I tell him I'll have to call the police to remove him if he won't go to which he said something like yes please call them. 

I go into the back and call the non emergency police number. They were quite busy so the phone rang for around 20 minutes. In this time the lovely man decided to leave. Not before trying to get the bar staff and my concierge worker on side. 

But that's not it. After this he decided to write 3 separate online reviews (luckily he didn't have my name) and used new accounts every time. Mentioned on these reviews that he will be taking legal action against me (for?) And also threw in a whole other bunch of lies. He then proceeded to contact our CEO and GM saying that I was making malicious phone calls to him (I think he was receiving some sort of spam calls and assumed it was something to do with me) and that I broke the law. He then proceeded to make 4 new fake reservations with fake details every day after the incident. 

Safe to say he was unhinged hahaha, anyone else have similar experience with pre-auths? Luckily I'm used to this stuff so it doesn't affect me but I can imagine how stressful it would be for a new starter.",27,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEFA1EE0>
645,Add the freaking name to the reservation!!!!,"For those of you who aren't hospitality workers you come here to figure out more stuff. You're the guests learning to be how to better guest, thank you for coming by the way, this is a great thing to do. 

  If you have a significant other or partner or your married please put your partner's name on the reservation on the reservation especially if it's a male. Because some females that come to hotels are coming to hotels because of domestic abuse.  They want to come here to get away from their significant other. 

An example, I just had a male come up to me and ask me what his room there was cause he couldn't remember he had the same last name as the person on the reservation same address could tell me everything about it but his name wasn't on the reservation. 

 I told him unfortunately I can't give him that information because his name isn't on the reservation he the reservation he then wanted to argue with me but his wife is on the reservation. I said sir you have to look at it from my point of view you don't know your room number and your name isn't even on the reservation that throws up red flags for me so if you'd like I can call the room and talk to her and he told me she's asleep and his daughter to sleep. After that I told him the best I can do is let you sit here and wait till they wake up at 7 AM or you can contact them. But unfortunately without your name being on the reservation I cannot, in good faith,, give you a key.

  And even if he did check in with his wife and I'm completely wrong I rather have my boss yell at me for being right and following policy, than have him yell at me because a female guest got hurt because I got lazy with key policy.

 So for the guests that do read these tales from the front desk addesk add your significant other to the reservation!!!  And for the FDA's that read this always always ask if there's significant other wants to be put on the reservation if they decline then you make sure to tell them that if a key is lost or room number forgotten, the next agent won't be able to help them, because they won't know him or her from Jack or Jill. It's an extra 15 seconds to add a name.

646,The Imaginarily-On Laundry Machines,"*(names made up blah blah)*

For best results, read this tale while listening to [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=az1Muj_UwQY), or any other laundry noise video of your choice.

So it's another hectic night at the Kusoplan Inn, we sold out just after my shift started, and I've already had to deal with one noise complaint. Now I get another.

So Charles from Room 110 calls around 20 minutes after midnight to complain about the sound of laundry machines running, which instantly sets off the thonk emojis within me. 

Now, we don't have guest laundry services, so the only time that our hotel's laundry machines, which are in our sole laundry room between Rooms 110 and 112, are in operation are when housekeeping is here (roughly 9 AM to 4 PM) and washes the hotel linens. They are never on at any point during night audit. And in fact, I had just been in the laundry room 15 minutes ago to grab some stuff there, and unless I've become deaf to the sonic frequencies that laundry appliances run on, said laundry stuffs were dead silent when I was in there.

I explain to Charles that our laundry machines are off and have been off all night, but they're calling bullshit on that. There was some construction going on across the street so I explain that what they're hearing might be that instead, but they're insistent that I'm just telling fake news.

Eventually the guest marches on down to the front desk and demands I turn off our laundry machines. I walk them to the laundry room and show them the room, as definitive proof once and for fucking all that our washers aren't washing and our dryers are ~~wet~~ off. Then they theorize that it must be the ice machine across from their room; at least that's a more plausible theory. I give them earplugs so that they can fuck off and go back to sleep.

*Then* they call again and argue that we have a second laundry room that's running, at which point I can't even take them seriously anymore. I did a little sweep past adjacent rooms and the rooms above them, nope nothing resembling a guest running their own laundry inside their rooms for whatever reason.

Finally around 3 AM Charles threatens to check out early, and I'm like ok, fine, you'll still be charged tonight but we will waive the remaining nights of your stay as per hotel early check-out policies. (And thankfully their res wasn't one of those shitty OTA prepaid bookings, since our policy on early check-outs for those bookings is stricter.) Only to back down on that threat because they couldn't find anywhere else to stay (at least they're not one of those people who will book a room for Saturday on Saturday 1 AM), and settled for a room move in the morning.

Sure enough, they move to another room during first shift the following morning. No complaints from them for the rest of their stay.

Anyways thank you for calling the Kusoplan Inn, no we don't do guest laundry or guest maimai. How may I help you today?",9,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEFA1AC0>
647,Christmas night with various gross moments,"Edit for Update on bottom of my first comment if anyone is interested.

Been an interesting night. I'm on hour 7 of a 12 hour shift. I've had various icky moments tonight.

The first was when I was putting away laundry in a closet by our ice machine.   I look over a I see something dark gray on the ground. It looked like it might be gloves.  It wasn't,  it was an adult diaper.  Luckily a trash can was right next to the ice machine,  I did not check to see if it was used. I ended up scrubbing my hands for 5 minutes straight. 

The second was when I went to clean up the lobby, a trash can by our coffee station was leaking.  There was no trash bag in the can.  I tried to transfer the trash to a trash bag, which ended up going all over the floor.  After cleaning up, I ended up scrubbing my hands again.

Third incident didn't happen with me personally, was when I was watching the cameras in our parking lot. A guy was outside smoking, I watch him take a piss while smoking, he continues to smoke using the same hand he was holding his junk in.  

The fourth incident is with a long term guest that is here for insurance reasons.  He  has been harassing all the women who work here and he is on his last chance before we throw him out.  He has made sexual comments,  offered pills to a housekeeper so she can get tired and rest in his room, he is constantly coming to the desk trying to get attention.   Tonight he called, at 930, with a long rambling conversation about how he needed me to come to the room. Accusing us of allowing people into the room, messing up his room, having  objects stlolen and who are staining things in the room. He also talked about how he has to walk everywhere, how he works here at the hotel, how he watches the news. Conversations with him go all over the place because he is all over the place mentally. 

This man is in his mid sixties, always in dirty clothes and mumbles because he has no teeth. He has obvious mental issues. The BO is strong with him. He is always eating or drinking something that is dropping on him as he walks through our lobby.

Anyhow, I think he finally got a woman to sleep with him. She is another guest that is staying here. They met up in the hallway, I saw this on camera, she followed him into the room, coming out about 10 minutes later. She went to her room, went back to his and has been there ever since.  The kicker is that there is a guy in a construction truck waiting for her in the parking lot.  I asked him what he was doing because he had been out there just waiting in the parking lot by our side door.  Construction guy has been out there for about an hour after knocking on her door once.  Meanwhile she is still in the long term guests room.

As I was writing this construction guy took off after waiting for her for over a hour.  She did  not go with him. I think she is still in the room. I haven't seen her in the hallway on camera.  Just heard yelling in the hallway, all of this has been happening on the first floor, outside door slams and he is in his doorway in his boxers putting stuff into a fabric bag.

That is my night so far, how is yours going.

Edit and update, the old man was finally thrown out along with his wife about two weeks ago. I haven't gotten the full story, the person who dealt with him has been out sick.  He started to wander on other floors on the weekend and bother the housekeepers, demanding to be let in the rooms as they cleaned. The front desk agent called the GM, who wanted to let them stay until their checkout date which was 1/31. The FDA said no they are checking out Monday, that no one felt safe with him.  The assistant manager contacted the insurance company and they were gone on Monday.",29,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEFA1C70>
648,Then Pay out of Pocket!,"Another tale from the front desk of the hotel industry!

Me: Chronically Depressed and Fairly Average.

So over the course of my time in the trenches of the Front Desk, I am not unaccustomed to the mistakes that can be made in a system and that overbooking is something a hotel should never do. This takes place on a Saturday in the period where the ‘stay at home’ order had been revoked and people were once again free to move around and conduct their travels. But where my hotel is makes it convenient for people both going to and coming in from the neighboring city for the beach and boardwalks (and all the hotels that are closer at that time are booked solid).

That said, we were a bit caught off guard at the sheer amount of people who wanted to go and it led to the following situation.

Saturday is usually a day where things get pretty hectic, there are a lot of reservations, and on top of those, there are same day bookings and overall the front desk can get crowded. So my shift ends at 11, but seeing the veritable horde of guests at the front desk and us only having only one night auditor on duty, me and one of the new Front Desk Agents decided to stay back to help her out. Now a lot of the guest have made third-party reservations, online companies and the like but we have a system in place that lets us tell our third parties we can no longer take any reservations and they stop sending them into our system. Thing is, if a guest made a online third party reservation and it doesn’t appear, we take no money for this and you can essentially can get a refund if you call the third party and get a refund as we technically didn’t have the reservation and therefore all the credit is still on the virtual card provided.

We were struggling to check everyone we could in but frankly it was taking time and the newest agent was having trouble and was constantly pulling me away mid-reservation to get my help despite me instructing him to not do that if I am checking a guest in (I was actually talking to a guest and told him to wait when within the next minute he literally dragged me to his console to help him [I didn’t appreciate that and neither did management when they heard]).

Finally a guest comes and states his name, and the newest agent can’t seem to find him, and there was a lull in my station so I was able to assist him. I check our check-in logs and even see if the third-party simply misplaced the first and last name when making the reservation, but no matter what I do, I simply cannot find his reservation.

He starts getting loud about his reservation should be there and we are lying.

We check every possible way we can, but frankly it’s not there and he demands we refund him.

I take over and explain that we didn’t take any money in the first place so we are not going to refund him money we didn’t take when he scowls and then says, “I don’t care if you can’t do it with a card! Just pay out of pocket!”

And he then he holds out his hand as though expecting us to hand him a wad of money.

I take a deep breath to reply calmly but the newest agent is now angry, “What the hell do you mean pay out of pocket? The hell we are paying you for a nonexistent reservation!”

The guest blinks and then says, “You can’t talk to me like that! I am a guest!”

I pinched the bridge of my nose and take a moment to try to push back the headache I know is fighting to form.

Several guests even shoot me a sympathetic look as they can tell I am doing my best and I have not raised my voice or betrayed my exhaustion from working an hour and half over my eight hour shift.

Either way I finally let some of my frustration out and tell the front desk agent that I am handling this and please focus on the last few guests in the lobby and don’t interrupt me. He looks disgruntled at the guest but does as I ask and goes back to the other guests.

I tell the guest the same in less crass wording and he curses us out before leaving.

I manage not to die on the drive home and spend my day off sleeping.",8,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEFA1B80>

650,Get fed by one of the guests,"So this family (mom, 2 daughters and a dog) have been staying with us since the beginning of September. The mom likes to bake so every week or so the girls will bring me cupcakes or a slice of cake or pie. It's a really nice treat after dealing with other people.

Well about 15 minutes ago they came down with a full Christmas meal: ham, dressing, mashed potatoes, peas, gravy as well as mini cheesecake bites and chocolate muffins! Since my family is doing the gathering later this week and all the stores are closed I had nothing to bring but a can of tuna. This really made my night!

It's a Festivus miracle!",46,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CC7EE0D0>
651,I don't really need their sympathy... Does anyone else want/need it?,"I'm sitting here at my hotel, working the evening shift on Christmas day, and barely three hours into my shift, I've already had at least a half a dozen people tell me how sorry they are that I ""have"" to work Christmas day. It's sweet of them, I guess, but completely misplaced. I am all about that holiday pay rate and am always the first person to volunteer for the shifts that pay for it.

I mean, is it just me in this small town, or are the holiday some of the easiest/quietest shifts to work in a hotel? In my hotel, people are usually in cheerful/festive moods, I get to dress up in cute holiday themed attire that I probably wouldn't wear being a hermit at home, and I bring my equally dressed up pup along to keep me company for the quiet shifts. ... Did I mention that holiday pay rate?

I'm spending my Christmas looking like a cute Mrs. Klaus, in good company with my helper elf/dog Max, listening to some Christmas jams, and working on art while I make twice my normal rate. Deck the fudgin' halls, it's a happy holiday!

Not only that, but I'm gonna rock my way around the Christmas tree and straight into a double shift on New Years day. Because who **wouldn't** want to put a 24 hour bump on their paycheck in a single day?

If you're reading this and working on Christmas as well, I hope you're having as merry an evening as I am. If you're working and aren't feeling too merry, comment below for a dose of holiday cheer! If you aren't working or if you don't celebrate Christmas, I hope you're having a great day and that offer extends to you all too!

Happy holidays to everyone!

Edit: 

Since pet tax was requested and I'm extra AF, I figured I'd share this with everyone. Max says Merry Christmas to all!

652,Free upgrade?,"This woman comes to check in, and it goes fine. Says she booked thru her company app. About 20 minutes later she comes down in a flurry. 

Her: so i thought i booked another room. I wanted the suite. 

I check the system. 

Me: ok so you booked the studio suite. 

Her: but i want the one bedroom with the separation. 

Me: let me see what we have… ok we have one available, the rate will just increase by $10. 

Her: but i booked it for $149 thru my company. I think the app said that room was $155. 

Me: the rate we have in our system is $159. 

Her: you can’t just honor the rate of $155?

Me: that’s not a rate we have available in the system. 

Her partner shows up and he seems uncaring and dismissive. This woman decides she wants to make a new reservation to get the $155 rate online. 

Her: it’s cheaper to book online, right? Maybe you can just honor it’s the discount i have online

Me: that’s hard to say. Sometimes it is, but we do not have access to any online rates or discounts.

Him: you already checked in and charged the card. Let’s just stay in the same room. 

She reluctantly agrees and walks off. 

People like this to me are just looking to get a free upgrade. “Oh i thought-“. You THOUGHT.

Lady, you checked in already and may have used the room already, but you want an upgrade because you didn’t understand the room you booked? Upgrades are for super shinies and guests who experience inconveniences, this is not included. 

No, we do not price match, and no, we are not supposed to use special rates the website gives. And the company rate she booked we also do not have access to as front desk.",23,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CC7EE2B0>
653,That's a Great Idea!,"Welp, Happy Holiday of your choosing fellow FDAs! Or, you know, Bah Humbug, if you prefer.

This happened several weeks ago, but I still chuckle a bit when I think about it.

So, I was working NA, middle of the week, as usual. It's usually pretty quiet and most of our guests since the whole pandelerium thing started have been working guys and gals, so I don't interact with them much. Especially since the restaurant opened up the breakfast again. (Hooray for breakfast!).

It had been a quiet night and I was finishing up my paperwork- so about 3am - when the doorbell dinged. We lock the lobby from 11pm to 6am, so I go to greet the guest at the night window. As I'm greeting him I think to myself, 'this guy is familiar. I've dealt with him before, but can't remember when'. We will call him Nut Job, NJ for short. He doesn't even look at me, just says 'I need a key to room 138' in a semi-hostile tone.

Me: Ok, sir, room 138. Do you have your ID on you?

NJ:  No.

Me: Are you the registered guest?

NJ: (glaring at me) Yes I AM.

Me: alrighty, what is your name, so I can look it up.

NJ: Just give me a key to my room. I don't have time to play games.

Me: I will need your name.

NJ: My name is Job! J O B! Nut Job! Give me a key!

Now, at this point I'm thinking there is very little chance he's gonna be getting a key, but I'll play along. I go to the bucket to pull the physical reg card, hoping a copy of his ID is there, or at the very least a signature I can try to match. There's nothing there for room 138. hmmm

I try to pull up room 138 in the computer, the room is vacant and out of order. ugh

I search for guest name 'Job' with no results. I searched old folios, still nothing. Welp...

I go back to the window.

Me: Mr Job, I can't find your name anywhere. Room 138 is unoccupied. Are you sure that's the right room number?

NJ: You just need to give me a key. I'm tired and I'm not gonna play these games tonight.

Me: I understand, but I can't give you a key to a room you are not registered to. I'm trying to find your room, but the room number you've given me is an empty room and I can't find a room registered in your name. Are you sure the room is not in someone else's name?

At this point he white knuckles the window ledge, leaning (almost pushing) against it, in an aggressive way. I notice that he has taken off his jacket, displaying tattoos on his arms of skulls and crosses and snakes. I wonder if he thinks that will intimidate me. His head is down and long, stringy dirty blond hair is hanging in front of his face. He slowly raises his eyes to me and quietly, threateningly, says

""If you're not gonna give me a key you better call a cop""

I immediately brightened, flashing him a huge customer service smile under my mask that I'm sure he could see in my eyes. ""That's a great idea!"" I enthused, ""I'll be right back!""

Off I went to the desk phone and dialed the local PD non emergency number, while he is cursing and otherwise yelling in the vestibule. He is soon joined by a woman, who is also yelling and cursing.

I'm watching them on camera as I speak to the dispatcher. She is a small woman with bottle blond hair and upon seeing her I realize that I HAVE interacted with these people before! A few months ago she was at my window demanding a key to a room she was not registered to - go figure. NJ was there too, but it was the crazy lady (CL) who took the lead in that encounter.

I explain to the dispatcher what is going on and ask that they send someone, which he agrees to do. When I hung up with PD I grabbed my cell and texted GM to ask if she had any information to share about room 138.

She responded almost immediately, letting me know that they were locked out. The company they were working for had checked out the day before. NJ and CL wanted to keep the room but hadn't paid. The room was trashed, so had been put ooo. The lovely couple's belonging were strewn about the room. The room was a mess.

I explained to GM that I had called the police, at NJ's suggestion and she let me know that I should give the cop a key so that the couple could get their trash and get out.

I went back to the window, where CL and NJ had started to calm down. I let them know that the police were coming and that they would be allowed to get their stuff and leave.

CL starts yelling at me that I'm a horrible person, a terrible desk clerk who should just give people keys to rooms, because that's my job. I do my patented wide eyed stare that communicates 'I could not care less about whatever you are yammering about, but please do go on and on'

CL gets the message and feels like she needs to refresh my memory, so she starts yelling about how I had called her boss in the middle of the night months ago (I did - he was the registered guest of all the rooms his employees were occupying) and how this was some personal vendetta I had against her.

I continue my wide eyed stare until the cops showed up.

After some back and forth I gave the officer the key and they arraigned for someone to sit with these people while they cleared out the room. Afterwards a different cop (who we shall call OC - Officer Cop) came to the window and let me know that the couple claimed to have paid the day clerk for the room for another night. I told him that if they had a receipt I'd be happy to let GM know so she could find out what happened. There was no receipt (shocking, I know).

OC asked, in a concerned way, if NJ had threatened me. I told him honestly that he had not, but had behaved in an aggressive way and told me that if I didn't give him a key I should call a cop, which I had done. The look on OC's face was priceless, and we shared a laugh.

He told me that NJ and CL said that I had it in for them and had refused to give them keys before. I confirmed that I refused to give keys to anyone, including them, who was not registered to the room in question. I explained that it was my job, it was for the safety and security of the guests. So, yeah, I had interacted with them previously but that doesn't entitle them to random keys to random rooms.

OC was nodding along and then told me that he had advised NJ that if he had a complaint he should call corporate or the owner, but if he tried to take it up with me again ... that path would lead to trouble, likely jail. To me this implied (along with the officer asking earlier if I had been threatened) that NJ was threatening to harm me in some way. To a cop...telling a cop that he was going to harm me in some way...smh, NJ is not the brightest bulb on the string.  I kinda chuckled and shook my head, but was basically unconcerned.

OC escorted NJ and CL off of the property, having instructed them not to return. He also gave them GM's card and instructed them to contact her if they had in fact paid money for the room which had not been credited.

To my knowledge they never did.",27,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CBA94E20>
654,Merry Fucking Christmas,"Disclaimer because people don’t understand: this is not a play by play, all of this happened over the course of a few hours, it is shortened, slight paraphrasing, but it’s for the sake of keeping this from being an hour long read.

Y’all know the song and dance, guest comes to check in, doesn’t have ID but she has friends ID and CC, sorry can’t check you in, -sigh- fine, they leave. I thought it was odd that it was dark outside and she was wearing her sunglasses, gave me a vibe. Anyway, I thought that was gonna be the end of it.

Boy was I wrong.

This is the tale of how Diamond, her boyfriend Slug, my houseman Tay and I spread holiday cheer this evening. Obviously all names changed.

So Diamond walks back in with Slug a good 30 minutes later and I greet them cheery as ever asking if she found ID, and she’s already being slightly aggressive.

Me: Hey! Welcome back! We’re you able to find your ID?

Diamond to Slug: Give it to her!

Slug hands me his ID and card, I check to see if his name is on the res, it’s not.

Me: I’m really sorry but I need an ID that matches the name on the reservation.

Diamond: I lost it, I don’t have one.

Me: I’m so sorry but it’s our hotels policy, I really can’t.

Diamond: Okay, well I paid for the room, I don’t have ID, you won’t take his, this is ridiculous just check me in! 

(This is where I’m starting to have a hard time even answering her because she keeps interrupting me, statements shortened and lengthened with no breaks for easier reading, but she’s repeating the same stuff over and over, again y’all already know)

Me: I understand but it’s a policy put in place to keep you and our other guests safe, it’s a rule for a reason.

Diamond: I **AM** safe, check me in.

Spoiler alert: she’s not safe.

Me: ma’am, I have had “safe” people come onto my previous property and beat the guest in the room. It is a rule for a reason and I can not check you in without an ID. I understand you lost yours, do you have ANYTHING with your name on it so I know who you say you are? Picture, credit or debit card, anything at all?

Diamond: no, I don’t! I want to talk to your manager right now!

Me: I’m really sorry but he has gone home for the evening and there is nothing more that I can do to help you

Diamond: I paid two hundred dollars for this room, I want a refund NOW.

Me: unfortunately it looks like you booked through third party (because of course she fucking did) so I need my managers approval, I’ll message him right away to get his approval but this can not be resolved immediately, and on this my hands are completely tied. I’ll resolve this as fast as I can and send you a message as soon as I’m done.

Diamond storming out with her silent Slug on her heels: I want this handled NOW!

Tay gets back from her break maybe after what feels like YEARS just after Diamond left so I filled her in. Not even 5 minutes after Tay comes back Diamond comes back in as well without Slug. She glared at me, looked at Tay and sickeningly sweet says she would like to check in. Barf.

Tay playing dumb like we weren’t literally just talking about her: absolutely ma’am! I just need to see a photo ID and method of payment!

Diamond: I lost my ID, could you please check me in?

Tay: I’m sorry but it’s our hotels policy to have an ID that matches the reservation at check in.

Diamond: well, I have an expired passport at home?

Tay: we can make a one time exception in this case if you want to go get it.

Diamond, total personality change back to being aggressive: well SHE didn’t tell me that!

Me: ma’am, I asked for ANYTHING and you never asked if that was an option, I would have told you yes!

Diamond: amazing, then check me in and make sure SHE doesn’t talk to me.

I look at Tay, quietly tell her I’m going to step outside because I was HOPING me leaving would help deescalate the situation. Well she starts yelling at me in my face “yeah you better leave, bitch” kinda shit, and at this point this woman has screamed at me a solid 20 minutes tonight, most of it alone, so AFTER I passed her, not facing her or looking at her at the very least 3 feet away I slap the back of one hand down onto my palm and say Merry Fucking Christmas.

Diamond lunges at me screaming “do you wanna go?” Threatening me and following me out of the lobby, Tay points at the other door and told her to leave.

I sat in my car for a couple minutes and tried calling my manager because it’s now almost 9pm, haven’t had a break, and I was almost assaulted. Lovely. Mind you, Tay and I had radios and were actively messaging on one of our work apps. Apparently while I was in my car Diamond comes back in and says she’s going to call the cops and have me arrested for assault, Tay invited her to and reminded her they would want to go through the footage. She came BACK in with Slug in tow and demanded Tay call our manager. Tay said absolutely, but it is 9pm on Christmas Eve so he may not answer.

Unfortunately he did.

Apparently as soon as Tay greeted him, Diamond started screaming her belligerent bullshit while Tay and my manager Kent sat on the phone silently allowing Kent to hear what’s going on. We’re called bitches dozens of times, including “power tripping bitches with nothing better to do”.

Kent: yep, refund her and call the police.

Tay in front of Diamond: Absolutely, I will refund her and call the police.

Tay finishes up with Kent, all while she’s screaming, and this is when I come back in because I KNOW Tay shouldn’t be alone right now. As I try to sneak into the back office so I’m not in the same room but near by a delivery driver comes in, so while Tay handles Diamond, I try to help the driver, and Diamond gets in my face trying to threaten me saying I assaulted her. Fun fact, she’s shorter than average, and I’m a 6’ tall woman. I literally stare at her, turn back to the driver and give her directions, then walk back to the office. While Tay is telling Diamond that we are cash free so we can’t refund her in cash, Diamond yelling “yeah you’re quiet now huh bitch” while Tay is TRYING to work on processing her refund. 

She starts screaming about a printed receipt, Tay asks for an email because SHES beyond done at this point too, and this is the first time I think EITHER of us heard Slug speak.

Slug: its “reda”

Diamond getting in his face: don’t fucking talk to her BITCH!

Slug: “cted@email.com”

Tay: awesome, I just sent it, now please get off our property or I’m calling the police.

Diamond: FUCK YOU BITCHES!

Slug leads her out and for the first time told her she should calm down and that’s enough after this issue has gone on for a few hours at this point.

Tay: Happy Holidays!

Kent did come to the property and checked on both of us, he informed the GM who said “yeah I don’t want her in one of my rooms on my fucking property!” And was happy with what we did.

Then Tay and I went home to our lonely Christmases since we both live across the country from family.

Merry fucking Christmas to us Tay.",38,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CC7D8D30>
655,All the scams…,"Preface this by mobile and all that jazz. 

I’m the ops manager for a hotel in podunk North Dakota.   At least that is still my title, though I officially left in July and just stop in to help with Direct bill accounts.   Anywho our main NA is out of town for Christmas so I volunteered to work night audit both Christmas Eve and Christmas Day.  Holiday pay for the win with no real family up here! 

I’m here currently and I’ve been here less than two hours and already gotten four different scams/prank calls.   All from my keys don’t open all the doors (total wtf) to the I’m the owner you need to do this (yeah no I know our owners and they’re locals).  

All well and good until the last one which was a guy pretending to be the owner.   Happened to have my name and called me by name.  (Side note, I don’t give my name when I answer any phone whether it’s here or at my other job).  So up goes the creepy factor of that one.  Granted I did end up laughing at him and telling him I knew the owners personally and he hung up.  

So yeah, let’s see how many fucked up calls I get the next two nights.    We’re off to a great start!",27,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CC7D8C10>
656,It's been a good run,"After 15 years as GM (and the last 10 as minority owner) at the same boutique hotel, I locked the doors to The Super Happy Fun Time Mountain Lake Inn for the last time and turned my keys over to the new owners. The majority owners contacted me a few weeks ago to let me know that they were selling their share of the business and already had an offer. I was faced with three possibilities; buy out their shares at a very reasonable price (which would entail a 10 year loan and commitment that I don't have the energy for), sell my shares to their prospective buyer or keep my shares and hope that I'd be able to work with my new corporate overlords.

Our property is small and unique in the way it's run. Although I was the GM, I spent more time at the front desk than all my other employees combined and was literally the face of the business. I truly enjoyed 99% of the interactions with my guests and the majority of our reviews specifically mention me, my wife or both of us. As much as I would have liked to stay on, I just don't have it in me to try and work things out with a corporate conglomerate that has never run a small boutique property. As I've said on here numerous times, I'm too old, too tired and too cranky.

658,Pull something else out of your hat other than a damn Rabbit... something like a Brain...," I made a pun there because this story revolves around a fucking rabbit.

I'm not the one who handled this but then I had listened in on the conversation AND saw the bookings. One thing to note is that we are listed on OTAs as NOT being pet-friendly as we need to control the pets that people bring and also it's difficult to control which rooms pet owners reserve if they don't book direct through us.

I was having lunch in the reservations office with the reservations manager (I'm the front desk manager but I have no time to go down to have lunch at the canteen so I just do it in the office) when one of my colleagues comes into the office and says ""I got a pet problem with a difficult customer can you help?"" And transfers the phone to the reservations manager.

The conversation goes as follows (M = Reservations Manager, D = Rabbit Dad/Dickhead)

M = Hello sir, my colleague has informed me that you are interested in bringing a pet with you to stay with us. Our pet policy is that we only allow small animals and ONLY Garden villas specifically designed for pets. Your reservation through OTA is for a deluxe room so you must pay the difference and a pet fee. The pet fee is 20$ a night and I will have to charge you a two-step upgrade which will be $40.

D = That is so expensive... why can't I just take my rabbit and sleep with him in the deluxe room

M = It's our hotel policy sir. You are not allowed to bring pets to stay with you in the Deluxe rooms.

D = But the price is too expensive!

M = I'm sorry sir I can't help you with that.

D = Okay then I will cancel my booking.

M = Sir as you booked through OTA you must cancel through them.

D = Why do I have to cancel through them?

M = Because if you cancel through us, OTA will still need confirmation from you regardless, and if you fail to respond you will be charged for your reservation as you will be marked as a no-show.

D = Fine.

Anyways, a few hours later, I come back to this dumpster fire:

Rabbit Daddy had booked another room through ANOTHER agency (And still booked a deluxe twin) AND STILL WANTED TO BRING HIS RABBIT.

We gave him the same reply as before, that he had to book a Garden villa because we designed it specifically for pets. I still made a huge facepalm because of this dude. It really seems as if he has so much free time on his hands but we don't.

Rabbit Daddy, put your brain back in your head and keep the rabbit in the magicians hat unless you want to book under our conditions, and can accept the extra charges instead of arguing with people who are simply there to tell you the conditions and price.",43,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CD118A30>
659,Yes Tammy you are still DNR'd and so is your husband apparently,"Tonight is my last shift. I figured I've taken enough abuse at my Motel SuxSuxSux to last a lifetime so I'm going to take break for a bit. Tammy was an ex-employee that was fired a little before I was hired here. I haven't seen her in a bit and of course she shows up on my last day to remind me why I'm leaving.

About 6pm in walks a guy who is DNR'd and I recognize him because I was the one who DNR'd him. He came in one night smoking in our lobby and when I asked him to step outside and smoke he became enraged and threatened me. I called the police but he bounced before they got here. This was about 1.5 years ago.

He reeked of alcohol I could smell it through the night window. He tried to rent a room and I denied him and he asked why. I told him to talk to a manager about it and he left. I updated his DNR status and entered a few notes on his folio.

About 10 minutes later Tammy walks in and the first thing she says is Am I still DNR'd *big smile*. I tell her she is and she says she knows her husband is also DNR'd and surprise he was the same guy that had just come in. I had no idea they were married but it figures.

Apparently Tammy was always a little too amp'ed and wouldn't/couldn't listen long enough to learn basic FD skills. She annoyed my last GM because she would always need his help and would become defensive at the smallest of criticisms and wouldn't apply herself. One day he just fired her on the spot and told her not to come back to the property thus her DNR. 

After I told her she is still DNR'd she asks me if someone else could rent a room for them. I look at her for a moment like seriously? What do you think? After a few moments I tell her No and she leaves the lobby.

20 minutes later and older woman walks in to rent a room and my senses are tingling. I ask her if they room is for her and she ways yes, 1 person but asked for a double room. I watch the cameras and there goes Tammy and her drunk husband lumbering to them room.

I called PD and ask to have them removed and explained the situation to them and they were served a no trespass order. 

Later Tammy calls and tries to act nice and wants a refund for her aunt, or mom, or whoever that lady was. Apparently Tammy remembered enough to book the room as an OTA so you know we couldn't cancel it. I'm not going to OK that even the the OTA agent asks. I don't tell her no just that she isn't the registered guest so I can't discuss anything with her.

 She amp'ed up a bit and started rambling about a family emergency or something which may or may not be true--doesn't change the situation though. I remain silent and she then said she worked here longer than I have and knows the manager (the one who fired her) and was going to report me for I don't know doing my job? I tell her he's no longer employed here. She doesn't say anything for a few seconds then tried to act nice again.

I cut her off and ask her if there is anything else I can help her with and she amp's up a bit more and asks for the current managers name. I refuse and tell her she is trespassed from the property and if she calls again I'll call PD. 

Sigh I'm not going to miss this at all.",92,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CD118670>
660,No Locals for a reason…,"Obligatory on mobile. 

I work a smallish 90 room hotel right off a major highway. All 3-11 shifts are spent alone. We had a new guy start about 2/3 weeks ago & he worked his 2nd 3-11 alone just last night. 

We have a strict no renting to those who live within a 50 mile radius policy. Of course unless something has happened and they’re in need of a place to stay. Anyways, at 10:30 last night, a local from about 25 miles away came in for a room. New guy wasn’t too aware on the no local policy. That’s fine, that can be corrected later. Guy checks in & all is fine and dandy until 3AM.

State police show up at the hotel looking for the guy. Tell him he’s in room XXX & send them up. About 10-15 minutes later, he’s being walked out of the building in handcuffs. NA is talking to police to get info for the incident report. Police warn NA that there is a gun in the room they could not find & someone will be contacting us to collect the guests items. NA says ok, someone will have to go up in the morning with a witness to retrieve everything. All is good for now, right?

In the AM, GM comes in and is briefed. Him, the head housekeeper, & maintenance go into the room to collect all the guests items & set them in the GM’s office until someone can come get them. In the room is professional recording equipment, condoms, and 16 pairs of women’s underwear. A freak show. 

GM, maintenance & HK collect guests items & take them into the office. They tore the room party looking for the gun & found nothing. With a witness, GM goes thru the guys luggage to try and find it.

It was a 9mm, fully loaded & cocked back. My staff could have been shot & killed. We call police to let them know gun has been found & how it was found. 

Fast forward, I come in for my usual 3-11. I’m briefed of the situation. Guys car is still out back & there’s also guns in there. I run out to look in the cars windows bc if I can see anything that shouldn’t be on property, i’m having it towed. Didn’t find anything crazy. 

The guys “power of attorney” (aka, his cousin) called around 3:30 to see about picking up the guys stuff. I tell him we need official paperwork stating he is the power of attorney before we release any items. Guy then tells me that he’s his cousin, he’s in a tough spot, yada yada. I repeat the info about the official paperwork & just straight up ask him, “hey, why was this guy even arrested?”

He tells me “about an hour before he checked into your hotel, he was at a bar, got into a fight, and pulled a gun on someone.”

661,Front Desk Angel,"Delete if this isn't allowed, but this is a tale from the other side of the Front Desk, and it's super cute. 

A few years ago, I had gone through a horrible breakup.  I was shattered by it because my boyfriend had broken up with me for his coworker he told me not to worry about.  I was heartbroken, so a couple of my friends decided to take me on a girl's trip for the weekend.  We booked a room with 2 queen beds through Groupon for $99 in a popular beach town in South Carolina.  

We go to check in an I'm intermittently sobbing, but I pull it together so we can get our info and just get to our room.  We had a brief exchange with the girl at the front desk about why we were there, but we didn't go into details.  We only said we're on a girl's trip to forget about the asshole who dumped me.  We get our keys and the front desk girl gives us directions to get to the elevators.

While in the elevator, we looked at the keys to see what floor we need to go to.  It just said ""P12"".  We pushed the P button and we're all like, ""wtf does ""P"" mean?"".  One of my friends joked that they were gonna make my sad ass sleep in the parking lot lol.

We get to the floor and the room has double huge double doors, like French doors.  We checked the keys many times because we thought it was a mistake.  We open the door because it marches the keys so we figured we'd try it.  We all gasped at the same time. IT'S A PENTHOUSE SUITE.  The most beautiful one I had ever seen, much less ever stayed in.  It had 10 bedrooms (we ran through and counted lol).  It had an UPSTAIRS with a full panoramic view of the ocean.  It had a balcony that wrapped around the side of the building and it was all ours.  We actually stood at each end and tried to see if we could hear each other talking, it was that big.  Every bedroom was modern and sleek and beautiful, each with its own TV.  There was at least one claw foot tub (there might have been 2, I don't remember).  It has 2 bedrooms that had windows that looked out to the ocean.  The whole entire place was shiny, I can't explain it.  It was just gorgeous.

We quickly realized that the front desk girl must have upgraded us, probably because we told her about me getting dumped.  We tried to bring her donuts during our stay to say thank you, but never caught her while she was working.  So, if you're out there Front Desk Angel, I just want to say - even though the reason for my stay was awful, thank for your giving me one of my fondest memories <3",26,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CD118970>
662,No Holiday Party,"Every year, we have a holiday party. Normally we just go out to a Mexican restaurant in town. My GM actually throws down a significant amount of money on it. I'm kind of in charge of planning it. I thought we were going to do it in her literal mansion this year, because last year... things got a little bit too turnt at the restaurant, to the point where I was shaking, thinking that we would be thrown out. My boss told me to warn everyone that alcohol would not be included, which shouldn't be a big deal considering you're getting a free meal that's going to cost at least $20. That said... no one listened. There were Patron shots being ordered for the table, a housekeeper even got our 19 year old front desk worker at least one shot, and a glass of wine. My boss capitulated, and bought all the drinks. The shots were $7.50 a piece, and there was a large stack of them.

 So, the solution was supposed to be a potluck at said mansion. I'd been asking her all month to set a plan for the party, so that I could go ahead and set everything up. FINALLY this Monday, December 20th, for the record, she sets the date of December 23rd, and asks me to get everyone to RSVP so we can make a super last minute reservation at the same Mexican restaurant that we almost got kicked out of last year, because ""no one will come if it's potluck."" 

I cannot stress enough how crucial it is to cajole people into these things with like at least three weeks notice. It doesn't help that morale has been particularly low this year for reasons too obvious, and relatable to list-- God, at least I hope they're relatable. 


Anyway, I get into work today, still the only RSVP. I start asking around, and no one wants to go, so I have to talk to the GM about cancelling it today. I suspect that part of the reason no one wanted to go was the very clear no alcohol instructions. But, it's not a prohibition of being drunk at the party. It's just a note saying that the company won't pay for it. 

It really sucks, because I was actually looking forward to it. My family normally does a big Christmas party, but this year they're going to be in Germany visiting my older brother. I was kind of hoping my ""work family"" could make it suck a little less, but here we are.

Edit for those interested: I couldn't edit this on my app, but I updated in the comments about how the party was back on, with only 2.5 hours to spare. Somehow, my GM's husband managed to snag us the reservations. I went straight to the bar, and bought my own margarona. The party was great... though there was a lot of passive aggressive buying of food. One girl accidentally ordered the wrong thing, but while she was ordering for her Mom, who worked here for years before suffering an aneurism, and having to get on disability, she also corrected her own order. So, in addition to five sides, which included a 12 piece chicken wings, she basically got three meals. Then today I found out that once again, my boss capitulated, and paid for all the drinks, well, except for mine. Another disorganized Shmampton Christmas was had by all.",29,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEF811C0>
663,Old guy steals another guest's beer and won't give it back until I called the cops.,"There was this seriously old ass man, like maybe 80 or more, who came to the desk to say that he had found another guest's case of beer. I thanked him and asked him to just drop it off with me and I'll get it to whoever it belongs to. He was reluctant to give it back, saying that he already had it under blankets in his car. He grabbed one of my manager's business cards, wrote his number on the back, and said that if anyone claims it, just call him and he'll head back from the casino (a 30 min drive). I said that I really have to insist that he brings them up to the desk, and that if nobody claims them, he could have them in the morning. He went and got them, I put them on a part of our FD, and I went back to playing video games.

Like not even 30 minutes later, he comes back in, and grabs the case of beer so I was like sir, whoa, wtf dude, except in customer-service language, so like ""hey mr so and so, I really can't let you take another guest's beer"". He got mad af in a split second, saying that he feels like he's being punished for being honest, so I pretty much just kept saying that I can't let him take someone else's beer but if he waits until tomorrow morning he could have them. His wife was like ""for god's sake bill don't make a scene"", but he was well past making a scene lmao so yeah, long story short, I had to be like sir you can't take that beer and if you insist on taking it I'm going to call the police, and our owners prosecute when they smell money"". I called the cops and they came in and the old man was like ""this guy's abusing me I just want to return this beer but he won't let me"" lmao

So the cops ask if I want to press charges, and I was like nah but they gotta leave the hotel. After that I went and deleted his email addy from his folio and all was well",21,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEF814F0>
664,I can check you in now....for a fee.,"Hello again! Lovely night audit back again. For background on the property I'm at, please see one of my previous posts.

This one begins at 4:05am. Guest and 3 friends show up. In the cast, we have Guest (G), Guest's friend (G.F. - which is actually going to be one of 3 friends, but I don't remember which ones were actually speaking so I'm combining them into one person), Sux (Suxpedia rep), and me (me),

(On the phone, as the office is locked between 10pm and 8am)

Me: (Standard hotel greeting)

G: I have a reservation and I'm outside to check in

Me: One moment, I will open the office

\--- I open the office and the guest and 3 friends enter ---

Me: What is the last name on the reservation?

G: It's (last name); I have two rooms

Me: I see your reservation. Unfortunately, as it is for the night of 12/22, check-in for this room is not until 3pm.

G: Can I have an early check-in?

Me: You could, but early check-in begins and noon. In order for me to check you in right now, which is still the night of 12/21, I would need to create a new booking for you.

G: How much is that?

Me: For each room, it will be (rate) + tax

G: Can't you just use my reservation?

Me: I'm sorry sir, but it is a 3rd party (Suxpedia, so yay) reservation, so I am not allowed to make any changes to the reservation. All changes must be made with them.

G: So I can call them and change the check-in date?

Me: Unfortunately, sir, as it is after midnight, they are only going to be able to make reservations for the following night.

G: But we need a room now!

Me: The only way I can check you in now is to create a separate booking, at the price I already quoted you. You will still be able to use your booking for tomorrow night, but that will not even be active for several hours.

G.F.: Why can't you check us in now?

Me: Our system does not roll over to the next day until 6am. At the moment, as far as our system is concerned, it is still 12/21.

G.F.: So, can we check in at 6am?

Me: Our early check-in policy is for a noon check-in. However, for an additional fee (which is roughly half the normal room rate, and only because I have the rooms available) I can check you in at 6am.

G: So, how much would it be to check in now?

Me: To check in right now, it would be X amount, as it is a new booking. If you wait and check in at 6am, on your original booking, it will be Y amount. If you wait and check in at 12pm on your original reservation, it will be Z amount. If you wait until 3pm, there will be no additional charge to your reservation.

*Cue spending the next 10 minutes going through those prices and the fact that I cannot give them access to the rooms right now unless they pay for a new booking, and no I will not let them put their luggage in the room right now and come back at 6 am unless they pay for a new booking.*

G: Okay, let me check with Suxpedia to see if they can change the check-in date.

Me: Sure thing (knowing full well that Suxpedia can't do that)

*cue me waiting about 5 minutes while Guest is on the phone with Suxpedia*

Guest comes back to desk with Suxpedia on speakerphone.

Me: This is the (hotel name) front desk

Sux: Yes, the guest (guest name) is trying to check in and wants to know if they can check in early.

Me: As I have already explained to Guest (who is standing right there), their reservation is for the night of 12/22, and our computer system does not shift over to the new day until 6am. I cannot use Guest's current reservation and check them in right now. I *can* check him in on a new reservation, but it he only wants to use his current reservation, then the earliest I can check him in is 6am for the early check-in fee.

Sux: I understand, Please put Guest back on the phone.

Me: *hands phone back to guest and waits to see what guest is going to do.*

G: (after hanging up) So, we can check in at 6am?

Me: Yes, but not before then without making a new reservation.

G: Ok, we will be back at 6am.

Me: Okay, see you in an hour and a half. *Escorts guest and friends back outside of office and closes/locks office door again.*

\--- Approximately 15 minutes later ---

Phone rings

Me: (Standard greeting)

Sux: Hello, this is (name) from Suxpedia calling on a recorded line. I am calling about a guest with a reservation for 12/22 who would like to check in early.

Me: Yes. As I explained to the guest at least four times, and have already explained to another Suxpedia representative .... (goes through explanation of times and early check-in fees)

Sux: Oh, ok. In that case, would you authorize the cancellation of this booking with no cancellation fee?

Me: (Note: It is a pre-paid booking, which the boss has already told us are not refundable under any circumstances, though our manager *has* been know to allow for refunds in certain situations and basically leaves it up to us. And, normally, I would allow it because it's for the next night and we can still sell the room. However, these guys tried to argue with me for 30 minutes and *then* wanted a refund when I wouldn't put them in a room - even though I told them the system WOULD NOT LET ME because the system is STILL ON 12/21.) No.

Sux: Oh. Okay. (I'm fairly certain she wasn't really surprised by my denial, given the situation, but just sort of surprised at me flat, one-word response.) So, that is a no for the cancellation without a fee?

Me: Correct. They can cancel if they want, but I am NOT authorizing a refund.

Sux: Okay. Thank you very much for your time.

\---- End of phone call and beginning of the wait until 6am, because I know they're coming back ---

*I decide to use this time to begin typing up this wonderful interaction for this sub, and get to the second phone call with Suxpedia when ....*

\--- 6:15am, phone rings ---

Me: (Standard greeting)

G: Hi, it's me to check in (yes, he said exactly that)

Me: *opens up office to check in guest.* I just need ID and a credit/debit card

G: *Hands me ID*. Do you take Orange Pay (Because I don't know it that company falls under the same rules as OTAs for naming)

Me: No. Credit/Debit cards only

G: *looks confused and digs around in wallet. Finally finds a card and hands it to me.*

Me: *Tries to charge card for the early check-in fee on the first of the two rooms. Card is declined.* This card was declined. Do you have another card you would like to use?

G: Yes. Just a minute. *Texts on his phone. A minute or so later, one of the friends who haven't been in the office yet comes in and brings his card.*

Me: (To friend) I will also need your ID for this payment. *I get his ID and try to run the payment. Success for the early check-in fee. Now I try to process the security deposit - declined.* (Note: we process the security deposits separate from the room payments, as they are just holds and it is easier to refund/release them at check out when they are separate.) This card worked for the early check-in fee, but was declined for the security deposit. You still own $X total for the two rooms. Do you have another card you would like to use?

G. F.: *Checks his balance on his phone.* There is enough of a balance, please try again.

Me: *Tries again. Still declined - Insufficient funds.* The card was declined for insufficient funds. Do you have another card that you would like to use?

G: *Hands me a credit card this time.*

Me: *Runs credit card. Security deposit does through. YAY! Goes to process the payment for room 2, beginning with the early check-in fee. Declined.* So, this card worked for the security deposit of the first room, which is now fully paid for. But it was declined for the early check-in fee on the second. Do you have another card you would like to try? *I am really trying to stay nice, but I only have another 90 minutes on my shift, I'm annoyed with these people, I am tired, so I'm sure the strain was coming through in my tone.*

G.F.: Will our room be available from outside?

Me: *Confused as to why this is even a question, since anybody with eyes and half a brain can see this is a motel with EVERY room accessed from outside.* All of our rooms are accessed from outside.

G: *Does something on his phone for a few minutes*. Please try that card again.

Me: *Prepares to try the card again, glances at card reader and GODDAMMIT! THE F#@\*ING MACHINE HAS STARTED IT""S NIGHTLY PROCESSING! so now I have to wait for it to restart. I explain this to the guest and we twiddle our thumbs for about 3 minutes waiting for the card reader.* *It finally comes back up and I try the card again. This time, both payments for the second room go through. YAY! I would also like to say that, while all of this is going on, the guest is also filling out the welcome form we use for each of the rooms and I have to hand them back to him a full 5 TIMES telling him each time that I need the FIRST AND LAST NAMES of each guest who will be in the rooms. After ask number 5, I finally have the forms fully filled out, so I finish processing the check-ins and hand them their keys at 6:45, letting them know that the wifi password is written on their key packets. I gladly usher them out of the office, close the office door behind them and come back to finish typing this up.*

I will be so glad when me shift ends in an hour and I can go to bed, because people who refuse to listen to what I am saying simply because they don't like it truly annoy me.

Editing to add:

 \-- phone rings at 7:11am --

Me: (Standard greeting)

G: Hi. Can you tell me the WiFi password?

Me: (In a slightly annoyed tone) It is written on your key packet.

G: Oh. Thank you.

Me: *Hangs up -* which is what I told you when I gave you your f#@\*ing keys! (Yes, I said this out loud, to the empty office, because it made me feel a tiny bit better. Well, not really. But it needed to be said and I couldn't say it *to* the guest.)",60,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEF81160>
665,Strange Man,"So, I currently have this guy. He's a guest, or at the very least has a guest wristband. He keeps coming up to the lobby, staring at me for about a minute, and then disappears into the elevator. He comes back within 5 minutes. He says nothing, doesn't even acknowledge me when I say, ""Can I help you with anything?"" It's just very odd. While I'm writing this he's currently staring at me.......not doing anything. He's done this about 5 times.

I told my Security guy about it. Apparently the guy is just wandering around. Maybe he's sleepwalking? I don't know.",11,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEF818B0>
666,An (almost) brush with (almost) celebrity,"Somewhere in the mid-to-late 2000s, I was working Audit on a weekend night at an economy-level brand of a national hotel group which uses stylized suns in the logos for many brands under its umbrella. So, by no means a fancy hotel, though it did have a pool and a hot tub.

The pool closed at 11pm so I never had to deal with it on my shift beyond making sure the door was locked.

So, anyway, I'm sitting behind the desk doing whatever at about 1am when this guy comes up to the desk and introduces himself as Mr. So-and-so, tour manager for ""the celebrity Rapasaurus Rex."" (not his real name, and apologies to any real Rapasaurus Rex who might exist; I didn't check) Turned out that ""the celebrity Rapasaurus Rex"" had done a show in our town earlier in the evening and was staying in our hotel. The tour manager was wondering if it might be possible for ""the celebrity Rapasaurus Rex"" to use the pool area for an hour or so. Not to swim, mind you, but just to have a space for ""the celebrity Rapasaurus Rex"" and his fans to have a meet-and-greet.

By this point in the story, dear reader, you may have noticed my (over)use of the phrase ""the celebrity Rapasaurus Rex"". This is intentional. Not because I'm trying to make fun of rappers or rap music or anything of the sort, but it is literally what the tour manager kept saying. Every time he referred to him, he would say ""the celebrity Rapasaurus Rex"".

Maybe I wasn't acting impressed enough at his name-dropping and felt like he had to keep reminding me of the status Mr. Rex had achieved. For reference, I'm a Boomer and know diddly-squat about rap ""celebrities"".

So the wind-up is I opened up the pool so ""the celebrity Rapasaurus Rex"" could have his meet-and-greet.

I never saw anyone else besides the tour manager and ""the celebrity Rapasaurus Rex"" enter the pool area. In an hour or so, even they were gone and I locked the pool back up.

Epilogue: curiosity got the better of me and later that night I did some Googling and found out he had a show on some cable network for a brief time and had made a few records or whatever.",17,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEF810D0>
667,Name-dropping irrelevant celebrities doesn't get you a room type that doesn't exist.,"It's short but this man is fishing *hard* for a discount, and working night audit means nobody is up for me to share it with. So, here we go!

&#x200B;

The man comes in and says he booked the room for his business associate, but they would be unable to make it so he would just take the room instead. Okay, not a big issue or anything. I just need the confirmation email showing that he actually was the one who booked it, which he did. So the check-in process starts. He's a musician and producer from outside of Atlanta. (. . .  yeah, you and thousands other bud. No, I don't want to hear your newest song.  . . okay you're going to crank up the volume anyway. . . cool.)

Then I ask him for payment. *He'll pay with cash.* We don't accept cash until check out. *oh, well he doesn't know if there's money on the card. you see, he's waiting for a check to clear then he'll have money on that account.* Of course the bank card in question was one of those sketchy banks that set up shop in Walmarts. But, of course it declines and he leaves, promising to return. Which, to his credit he does, and with a working debit card no less! But there's now an issue. 

Man: I thought I paid for it already?

Me: No, we charge you when you get here. You have to present the card. 

Man: Oh. . . hmmm . . . well I thought they took the money out. Why did they give me a confirmation number then if I didn't pay?

Me: It's a confirmation that you reserved that room.

Mind you he had no problems paying twenty minutes prior, and the card used to book was neither one of the cards he offered up to pay. 

He gets checked in and everything is good, until twenty or so minutes later the man comes back downstairs. 

Man: This isn't the room I booked. 

Me, after checking the booking: It says you booked a king room, and that is a king room. . .  is there a problem with it?

Man: Yes. I booked a king suite with a separate bedroom and a pullout sofa. 

Me: Well, we don't have any rooms like that here. The closest thing we have is a room with a sofa bed. 

Man: The man on the phone said I had a king suite with a separate bedroom and a pullout sofa. 

Me: We don't have any men that work here, so you might have spoken to reservations, but like I said we don't have any rooms with the separate room. We only have our standard kings. 

Mind you he paid $115 for this room. What *nice* hotel has a suite like that for $115?

Man: I told you I'd planned on having my friend stay here, but he didn't make it. But if he had he would have had his daughter with him, and then I would have been embarrassed. I was told I had a king suite with a separate bedroom and a pullout sofa. 

Me: Like I said, I'm not sure what you were told, but we *don't have rooms like that.* I'm sorry that whoever you spoke with, probably reservations, told you that. But is there a problem with the room now?

Man: I would have been embarrassed! He would have came and I booked this room for him! And it would have been wrong. (remember this room hadn't been paid for until this guest got here. so, all this man did was book it.)

Me: I'm sorry about that, but there isn't an issue now is there? You're in the room type on your confirmation, and the other guest isn't staying. I'm not sure what you were told or who told you that, but again, we don't have rooms like that, and we don't even advertise the rooms with sofa beds. So, I'm not sure where whoever you spoke to got that information. 

Man: But this could have embarrassed me! I work with this man *in the music industry.* I'm here in *Smalltown, South Carolina* and I'm working with Justin Timberlake! Do you know who that is?! I could have been embarrassed!

Me:. . . .

And of course he wants to speak to management in the morning.",39,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEF81250>
668,"Yes, sir! You sure showed me! Bluh, indeed!","Hello, fellow front desk folks. Are you all tired of this holiday season? I sure am. Last year I was out with Covid, so I didn't experience any of the wrath I've had to handle this year. I wonder if last year's bunch was quite this bad?

Tonight was... something. As always, I'm 3-11. The beginning of the day wasn't fun, a lot of rooms not ready until after check-in time, but I only had to deal with a couple Fuming Freddys. I thought I was in the clear after I got through the majority of my check-ins, but I was, obviously, very wrong.

Context time: my property is built on top of a shopping mall. Because of this, the parking situation is a bit interesting. The hotel and the mall share a large parking garage, but the hotel has exclusive use of most of the first floor and basement floor of the structure. At the 1st floor, the allowance is about 8 feet, but as you go lower in the structure, it goes down to as low as about 6'5"". This is posted, so people are given plenty of warning about this. And, did I mention that the front desk staff are *not* actually the ones that built the garage? I know that must be shocking, because it clearly did not occur to the gentleman that stormed up to the desk at 11pm, right as I'm trying to shift change with night audit.

(We'll call him Parker. Just for fun. No offense to any Parkers out there, I love that name.)

Parker: Have you had anyone complain about your garage?

Me: (a bit confused by the question) What... part of it, exactly?

Parker: HOW THERE'S NO ROOM! THE SIZE OF IT!!

Me: Are you having an problem finding a space, or...?

Parker: NO! The *size*! It's too small!

Me: Oh, as in the size clearance? Not usually, but I do apologize--

Parker: BECAUSE THAT GARAGE IS THE REASON I WILL *NEVER* STAY HERE AGAIN. (already walking away, but yelling at me across the lobby as he's doing so) I WON'T TOUCH THIS PLACE EVER AGAIN WITH A TEN FOOT POLE, ***YOU HEAR ME***?

Me: Okay... Okay. Have a great night, sir.

Parker: (like an actual honest-to-god 6 year old throwing a temper tantrum) **BLUHBLUH BLUH BLUH!!!**

On any other night, I might have laughed. Seeing a middle aged man, easily 20 years my senior, actually resorting to schoolyard mimicry would normally be the height of comedy. But, after staring at him walk away with his family in tow, all I could do was cry. My coworkers comforted me, and told me not to take it to heart, but it's been so awful lately. Apparently, a guest is calling me a bitch to my bellmen for calmly standing up for someone they were berating last night, I have been constantly belittled and spoken down to this entire holiday season... It's exhausting. I'm so tired.

But, now that the moment has passed, and I'm not quite as upset, I figured its funny enough to make a post about. I hope that ya'll get a kick out of it, at least. Keep your chins up. I'm going to try and keep mine that way.",27,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEF7FD30>

On Dec 2nd I got a message from my now former FOM (I left the hotel in like April). He is GM now at a new property, as the one we worked at shut down and it being demolished. 

**His text read:** 

""OMG I had a that you got into it with at \*previous hotel\* today""

**I responded:** 

""Wait what?! Which one haha, and if it is the pizza one... I still wanna deck her""

**FOM:** 

""Yes, me and that b\*\*\*\* went to war today.... yeah her.""

**Me:** 

""Please for the love of god tell her I said Hi. Lemme guess, she wanted something free? I still tell stories about her.""

**FOM:**

""Lol i can't tell her anything. I threw her out of my hotel and refused her refund. OH and the best part is that she reached across at me and I hit her with Pepper spray."" 

**Me:** 

*Laugh emojis* ""Man I wish I had that... I so would have done that when she reached around my desk. Did she remember you?""

**FOM:**

""Yes she reminded me who she was when she checking last week. She checked out early and wanted a refund. My hotel offers no refunds so she was mad. She was very furious and I started laughing a bit and she said she called corporate and that the said it's up to you (Manager), I responded, well i've decided against you.""

670,So fed up with groups,"I’ve been upgraded to sales manager which means now dealing with group blocks and the likes. I seriously don’t know how these people function in real life. 

We give deadlines. It’s in the contract. Still I get phone calls or emails from these twits weeks after telling me they are ready to pull the trigger. Great. We’ll be starting again and the rate has gone up because I don’t trust you. At. All. Also we now don’t have all the rooms you wanted. Suck it. I don’t care. 


Then after everything is signed I get the request for more. Then when I can’t give them what they want they demand a discount.  People are already getting a huge fucking discount!! One guy bitched about getting a double instead of a king because he wanted 2 more rooms after they filled their block. No. You are getting $100 off. They can deal. 

People also try to get out of everything. We didn’t drink all the minibar!  We didn’t do that!  We don’t have a FOM so it’s me at the moment. The GM and I are sooooo tired. If Night audit fails to show up we rock paper scissors for it. I stayed up for 24 hours once. I know this is not a unique occurrence here. But even when it’s insane and I have to redo the conference room last min I still love it. It can be so much fun.",39,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEF7FA30>
671,"I also also got a guest fired once. A few times, probably.","So there have been a couple posts in this vein, and some hilarious comments on them from people who have very strong opinions about it. I wanted to throw my contributions into the ring.

Like others, I think I've possibly gotten 2 or 3 people fired for trashing rooms. Now, some folks seem to think this is 'snitching' and that transgressions such as smoking pot aren't a big deal. I dunno where they're from but where I live smoking of any kind in any public building is illegal and as such all hotels have adopted no smoking policies. Technically I think you might be able to legally smoke in a hotel room, as it counts as a residence, but obviously businesses can restrict activities and this makes our lives a lot easier and it's 100% consistent. 

You smoke in a hotel room and we're gonna fine you if we can. If your employer is somehow responsible for covering or reimbursing your stay, those charges are going to show up and will often be clearly labelled on the receipt. We do not care to sugar coat or hide that information for someone who, in most cases, will have been added to the DNR list. If that leads to you no longer having a job, that's not on us. We didn't smoke in a clearly labelled no smoking hotel.

But none of my stories about this are exciting. Let me instead spin the tale of the guy who I got fired at Christmas.

I used to work in a hotel that was very popular with local businesses to host their Christmas parties. I do not remember which party this was, but it was a big client. Like, they had the money and should have booked at a much nicer hotel, but they liked us for some reason. I was the MoD but also oversaw most of the banquet parties so I had spoken a number of times with the organizer, let's call her Laura, and we got on very well.

The party was going great. I was busy running between the party and my other duties in the hotel when I get a call to come check one of the public washrooms. I walk in and the giant mirror behind the sink is shattered. The paper towel dispenser is on the floor. There's a huge, roughly human-sized dent in the gyprock, as well as a large hole punch through in the center, and footprints in white dust that run up the wall almost to the ceiling.

Security and I track the white footprints out of the washroom and into a nearby stairwell where we find two guys, one neatly passed out, and the other loudly and drunkenly conversing with his near-comatose pal. I recognize them because I saw them at the party earlier. Security asks what to do and I say to hold off.

I return to the party and catch Laura's attention.

""Hey Laura, I hate to bring this up and ruin the mood, but I think two of your party guests have had enough and need to go home.""

""Okay,"" she says. ""No problem. Have they been cut off?""

""Oh my yes. Also, I have to notify you that they have damaged the hotel and I wanted to check with you about how to proceed. We will need to pursue damages from someone.""

""Is it bad?""

""It's pretty bad.""

Laura is shown the bathroom and we see the culprits headed back to the party so I point them out. Neither cam walk straight and one still has drywall dust all up his pant leg. 

Laura apologizes and heads off to talk to them. They were given a cab and left the property. We received a very apologetic letter a few days later as well as assurances the company would cover the damages, and that next year those responsible would not be at the party. Because they'd been sacked.",50,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEF7F130>
672,I also got a guest fired once.,"I was just reading another post here about reporting someone smoking weed and getting them fired and it reminded me of a similar story of my own.  I never worked front desk, but I was a bellhop for a while at the ""nice"" hotel of a smaller city.  There had been a large train derailment and a spill of the chemical fertilizer Anhydrous Ammonia.  One person who couldn't escape the cloud of fumes had died and the federal government had sent NTSB investigators.  While they were in town they were all staying at the hotel I worked at.  These were government workers not visiting executives so there wasn't a whole lot that they needed from me outside of room service deliveries, but while walking the halls cleaning ashtrays, some floors were designated for smoking, I was hit with a very powerful smell of weed, they had that good good.  I personally think it should be legal so I just went about my business, but apparently another guest called down to complain and when the front desk called me on the radio to ask me if I had noticed I said yes, and unlike the complainer I knew exactly which room it was.  She then apparently called the cops and our guest, who was one of the people in charge of the NTSB investigation, was arrested and we never saw her again.  I still feel bad about it.",37,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEF7FA60>
673,I accidently got a guest fired once,"I am no longer in the game (laid off just before COVID), but stick around this sub to remind myself what I miss and don't miss about the industry. I thought I would dust off a few of my tales from back in the day.

I was working as the FOM of a mid-level 162 room property. Around 7 AM shift change I get a text from my overnight security: ""is (GM) in today, or who is MOD?""

Me: ""(GM) is out of town, so it's a combo of (chief engineer) and me. I'm planning on being in around 9ish, but Chief should be there shortly. What's up?""

Security: ""Had to punt on a maintenance issue at midnight. No biggie. Left both of you a note, didn't want to do a full report if I didn't have to. Let me know if you have questions.""

When I get to the hotel, I discover that we were sold out the previous night, and when our last guest checked into room 413, none of the lights in the bathroom were working. Security and audit ""stole"" some lamps from my office to get the guest some light in the bathroom. 

About 11, Chief lets me know he's going up to look at the lighting situation in 413. A few minutes later, he calls down to me to ask for details on the guest in 413. 

I pull up the reservation, and I have a name, 2 registered guests on a 2 night stay checking out tomorrow. Chief tells me when he knocked on the door and spoke to the guy in the room, he was certain he smelled pot. I told chief to wait for me to come up and join him at the room. When we get there, Dudebro is just stepping out of the room, eyes clearly glazed over. 

""Hey, you weren't smoking pot in there, were you?""

""No man, it was my roommate, I was asleep man.""

""Well, I don't care who it was, I am kicking you out of my hotel. Cops will be here in a half hour, I suggest you be gone by then.""

45 minutes later, Chief and I go back to 413, rooms empty, so we start looking to make sure housekeeping isn't going to find free drugs. Chief calls to me from the bathroom ""hey notice anything unexpected?"" I poke my head in to see what he's talking about and find him flipping the lights on and off. Seeing my puzzled look, he says ""lights work, and your lamps aren't in here."" We have a good laugh on our way down to our offices thinking we misread the note. Nope, both of us had a note saying the rooms with bathroom lamps was 413. I check with my desk agent, she says the auditor told her 413. I call my security guard. She says she can't remember which room it was, but knew it was across from the elevator. 

Sure enough, room 314 checked in right around midnight.  And Chief found my missing lamps. 

A few hours later, my desk agent calls saying there is a lady on the phone asking about some credit card charges. I take the call, and it's the boss of Dudebro and his friend, asking why their card had charges for 2 nights plus almost $300 extra, and they had to call her to get their spending limit increased. I told her that it was because we kicked them out because we caught them smoking pot, and charged them for the second night because the room was out of order, plus a $250+tax cleaning fee.

""I would like to apologize for the actions of my soon to be former employees.""",256,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEF7FA00>
674,“We better get something for free! It’s always about the customer and making them happy!”,"This lady called our resort and made a reservation for her anniversary for the New Years weekend… after we went through the room rate with all taxes and fees the guest got upset we didn’t apply her AAA discount.

We told her that unfortunately our managers had made it clear that during the holidays we cannot apply discounts. The lady was not having anything that we were telling her and said that she better get something for free during their stay since it’s their anniversary and for the inconvenience of not applying a AAA discount.

We told her we can try our best but it’s not guaranteed… apparently this lady has worked in the hotel industry for years and said it has always been about making the customers happy and she knows we can do something. 

“Either you give me something for free or you will never hear the end of it!”

676,"Why I quit, and wondering if I was in the wrong.","It's me again, the person from the armed robbery and the redneck with the matches.   I can't believe I never knew this sub existed until recently.  Anyway I have a question that's been bothering me since 1999 when I quit.  I really did love working in the hotel industry and I regret quitting, the chain I worked for is huge now.

I continued working the front desk at this hotel for about a year after the robbery.   I was the relief night auditor, meaning I worked 11pm-7am two days a week.  And I would get two days off a week, normal stuff there.  However, for some reason every time I worked the night audit, my manager would schedule me for 3-11 that same day.   Like I would get off at 7am and have to come back at 3pm two days a week.  Then the other days I worked 3-11.  My question, is this normal?

I told my manager I couldn't do it anymore.  It was really screwing with my sleep, the turnaround time was murder on my body clock.  He saw no problem with this.  He kept saying ""you have 8 hours between shifts.  I know several nurses that would gladly trade places with you.""  I kept telling him I couldn't do it and he kept scheduling me.  I told him I was going to quit.  He wouldn't budge.  I wrote a letter and slipped it under his door one morning and said I was going to quit if I had to do this one more day.  Sure enough the schedule was posted the next day and it was the same shit.  So I quit after my shift ended that day.

Was I in the wrong?  Is this normal for the relief night auditors?",32,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEF7FE80>

Alright, so *maybe* she's not actually a CIA agent. She did also mention that she was the Pope so that's a possibility. My coworker did not flee, and he was not punished with beheading or being shot. We did not determine who ""her"" or ""that one who's from Jamaica"" were. I did spot the possible CIA agent staking out the hotel from across the street later that day, along with her dog who I think was the FBI agent she was referring to.

She's haunted our hotel before, the week before she pulled a fast one on the same auditor she lectured to in the video. She scammed a free night by cleverly asking for a key to an unoccupied room, and like a fucking idiot he didn't verify that she belonged in that room and handed the key over.

She's also the star of [this](https://redd.it/oy8wml) story.

*Cast: Me, security and Mr. Owner.*



^(I didn't hear the beginning of the conversation , honestly I was zoned out watching youtube as It's normal for my security guard to talk to guests casually, and that's what I panned out the interaction and noise to be. I knew I wasn't needed at the moment, so I focused on something else, this is what snapped me back into reality.)

**Security:** Fearless-ad2991

**Me:** Yeah?

**Security:** Call the cops

*In the moment I hesitated, as It caught me off guard, but walked up to the desk and dialed the number.*

**Mr. Owner:** I own this hotel! You can't call the cops on me. I'm going to call security on you.

**Security:** ... I am the security guard on duty, and you're not the owner.

**Mr. Owner:** Ask her! *points at me* Ask her! She knows who I am

(spoiler, I don't.)

**Security:** She has no idea who you are. I'm going to need you to leave the property.

**Mr. Owner :** *\*horrible word\** You're gonna regret this *\*horrible word which I will not insert\** I'm not leaving my OWN hotel. I bought this hotel today! It's MY property! Ask her! She knows I bought this property today.



***At this time in the incident I'm on the phone giving all the needed info. funny side part, the 911 line was actually BUSY! told me there were no available lines.***


**Security:** You're not the owner, and you're leaving now.

*I'm not sure if he got intimidated by the securities size, or if it was how he looked, but he left, and said he'd be coming back tomorrow with the documents lol. And I mean, to be fair, our security guard is pretty intimidating, I wouldn't want to get into a fight with him either*. - **sweet nice guy once you get to know him though**




Security and I were laughing about the situation after, about how stupid the guy was, and he told me he was close to knocking the guy out after he called him *\*bad bad word\** as he didn't know the dude and it was racist and out of line.

679,Guests Ran Out Without Paying and Came Back a Week Later,"This is my first post here so bear with me.

For some backstory, our hotel has a high turnover rate for employees including GMs, so front desk employees had no prior experience and never got fully trained. Instead, they would be thrown out to work the desk after training for barely a week with only training videos for guidance. I’m the only person who received training from the previous staff before they all quit and I got promoted to supervisor. For this story I’ll be calling our system Op.

This happened about a week and a half ago. We had some guests staying in 2 rooms. The person whose name was on the reservation, let’s call her C, never actually checked in, but the res. had an accompanying guest on it who we’ll call D, who checked into the room. In hindsight, we shouldn’t have been checking accompanying guests in without any authorizations, but our GM always said it was okay as long as their name was on the res.

It’s checkout time on Monday, I’m calling guest rooms to inform them that it’s time to go. I get to D’s rooms and tell them they need to check out. Room 1 says they’re extending but room 2 says they’re leaving then calls back to extend. Okay. I authorize room 1 for another night, but room 2’s card declines. Shit. I contact them about this. They ask if we can have the card on room 1 pay for room 2, but Op is complicated and has no clear way to do this, so I tell them no, I need a card to which they say they’ll bring another form of payment. The day goes by and they don’t come. I see D on his way out and tell him he needs to bring a new payment method and he says he will when he comes back. I tell the next shift who is the assistant manager to call them and ask for payment which they never did. 

I come in on Tuesday, once again, they ask to extend. Unfortunately for them, I don’t have their rooms for tonight, nor the payment they promised so I told them they need to bring a form of payment. At this point they ask for a new room and to just transfer their charges. I tell them in order to do this, I need them to pay what they owe and they have until 1pm to do so if they are switching rooms. They say okay. Time passes. It’s almost 1 so I’m watching our security cameras to make sure they are coming down. I see D walk in, so I’m under the assumption he’s getting his group together to move rooms. I see them leaving the room and receive a spam call. When I look back at the cameras I don’t see them anywhere. Confused, I go back through the camera footage to find they went out of a side door. In my dismay I let the managers know what happened.

I try calling the original person on the reservation. The number isn’t in service. Unfortunately, we didn’t put the information of any accompanying guests in our system. Basically, we have nothing to go on other than to make a house account for them. The one thing I did manage to obtain was their license plates from the camera footage because they happened to drive the wrong way in the parking lot, the way that had the only outdoor camera.

Fast forward to this week, I saw D get off the elevator and try to hide his face like I didn’t see him a week ago. I check our in house guests on Op, this time D checked in under his own name. I check the security camera footage to find out when they checked in only to find out the reservation was made over the phone and the person at the desk checked them in before arrival which is something we NEVER do, and on his arrival they didn’t check his ID or credit card because they were too busy facetiming friends. 

I contact my GM and we charge the full amount of their stay to cover the costs of D’s previous stay, as well as a $500 smoking fee for last week and this week because their rooms reeked of the devil’s lettuce, and then we kicked them out. So satisfying.",47,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEF7FFD0>
680,"Y'all asked for more, so here goes.","# The Cinco De Mayo Shitshow:

TW: mild gore.

Cast will be:

Me = Yours Truly

BG = Birthday Girl

DT = Drunk Twit

**The Preface:**

Covid had just started, its May 5th 2020.

people are partying, noone really cares, afew noise calls, nothing major, until...

**The Fecal Matter Meets The Rotary Impeller:**

i get a call from rm 425.

Me: Front desk, Wraith speaking, how may i help you?

Rm 425: yea the guy next-door is trying to kill his wife or girlfriend! (i can actually hear the shouting and screaming through the phone)

Me: ill take care of that right now! thank you for letting me know.

i call 911 and the 3 cars of 5 cops show up for a DV and assault call.

myself, security, and the cops go to the room. \*cop knock\*

DT opens the door and we can see blood all over the floor of the kitchenette. cops make her open the door all the way and let us enter, 2 go into the bedroom and talk to the BF/Hubby. one cop tends to her bleeding foot while 2 question her as she declined EMS. story as follows.

DT: we were drinking and having a good time, i dropped a glass and cut my foot which killed the mood. my BF got pissed and started yelling at me for being clumsy and getting hurt and ruining our date night. he's just a little drunk, he never hit me and he just gets loud when he is drunk.

due to the noise, and the blood, they get kicked and DNRd.

follow them down and outside where the cops bring the BF out separately.

SHE GETS IN HER CAR AND TRYS TO DRIVE AWAY

cop stops her before she gets out of the parking space and arrests her

DT: what the hell, why are you arresting me?

Cop: you are plainly drunk and just tried to drive away, in front of 5 cops.

Me: \*internal manic laughter\*

i go back up to the room to see what damage was done and to take pics.

**The Carnage:**

the glass she ""dropped"" was 1 of the 6 in the room that they set up on the counter and threw the cutting board at (through) breaking them all and putting a hole in the wall from the cutting board.

what i thought was water on the kitchen floor was actually spilled tequila from 3 opened, now empty bottles. there were 2 more on the bedroom counter and 1 in the bathroom.

now the one in the bathroom is special. it was one of those white clay bottles with the blue flowers painted on it that looks like a lamp or vase, and costs over $100. they couldn't figure out how to open it, so they smashed the top of the bottle off against the bathroom counter. there were bits of ceramic all over the bathroom.

this bitch had also walked over the king bed, the comforter, the pillows, the pullout, comforter, and pillows, and every towel in the room while her foot was bleeding. if it was white cloth she got blood on it.

the wall lamp cover was ripped next to the bed. and there was tequila in the fridge, microwave, and dishwasher, without a bottle.

i posted $1000.00 and my GM posted more after repairs and replacements were done and the room was back in service, over a week later.

&#x200B;

**The Cherry on top:**

when i came back down and out to the cops to get their DL info in case the GM wanted to file destruction charges i got another surprise.

earlier, when we first went out and she tried to leave, a group of people left out the back door and jumped into a jeep as we watched and left the parking lot. (didnt think much of it, probabaly guys with hookers or there for a hook up. boy was i off) we found out they were friends of the kicked room booked by the same person and when checked they were trashed a bit too. all 3 rooms locked out.

in walks BG with her BF

BG: umm my key isn't working .

Me: ok sorry about that. what room?

BG: rm 405.

Me: (WTF these dudes bounced) im sorry but that room was locked out for trashing the room and in conjunction with another room that was kicked.

BG: but its my birthday, me and my friends were getting tattoos in there. \*pulls down the right side of her sweatpants waistband infront of me, security, and the 2 cops that came in to finish report. flashing her shaved lady bits and the new tattoo that went from her hip to her inner thigh, covered in cling wrap and tape\*

Me: (WTF) ok can i see your ID.

she hands it to me, i look at it and hand it directly to the cop.

she had just turned 16, it was a learners permit. and she was drunk. they had just got back from a walk to 7-11

the cops took her and asked some questions about the artist and the other friends, the parents were called.

and no, i couldn't tell you what was tattooed on her leg, it was crappy as hell or just that weird or unfinished. i can tell you the new pubic piercing she was sporting was infected. she was in for a bad time.

681,"As a token of our gratitude, here's a hotel stay that we can't actually give you.","Earlier this weekend, as I was doing my usual AM shift duties of going over the arrivals report and updating folios, blocking people into rooms and the like, I noticed a reservation that set off my desk jockey senses: an employee rate booking with a completely unrelated company in the Company line. Now, this can happen accidentally, like when someone uses Chrome when booking on our website and their autofill gets a little trigger-happy (ever seen ""None"" for a company/business?), so I decided to open the folio and take a look.

As I looked over the information, I realized that the email domain matched the company name, and that the specific email address matched the name of the guest.  Okay, so this guest most likely isn't an employee, but if they are the family member of an employee they could still qualify for the employee rate; they just need to have the rate form at checkin. This isn't a big deal, and I keep going through my arrivals.

Fast forward a few hours, and I get a call from a woman who wants to check if her reservation is at our property. I ask her for the name or confirmation number, and while she can't find that, she gives me both her and her husband's names. Unfortunately, I can't find anything. I'm searching the first few letters in my computer, I'm checking my arrival report for their first names in case the last name was spelled wrong, I'm asking her to respell her name, the works.

Then she asks, ""Do you have a reservation under (Company Name I saw earlier)?""

Oh . Oh no.

I tell her ""I do have a reservation with that company in the email address, but the name does not match.""

She immediately names the person who is on the reservation, and says that he is her husband's boss. She tells me that she is going to call the boss and get things sorted out, then hangs up.

I resign myself to my fate, and to waiting for a call about getting the reservation changed.

About an hour and a half later, the couple shows up to check in. They hand over ID and a credit card, and I realize that the reservation never got updated, nor was a new one made, nor did the person who booked it even contact us. Well okay, I can just make a new reservation at the rate if I have to, I just need the rate form, and so I ask the couple for theirs.

""What form?""

OH. NO.

I explain that the rate the reservation was booked at requires a form, which shows that the person actually qualifies for the discounted rate. The couple tells me they don't have a form, but they do have a certificate...and proceed to present a designed-in-MS-Office atrocity that declares them the lucky recipient of 2 nights at our hotel, with gratitude from the guy whose name is on the reservation, his brother, and his sister. Surprise, they own and manage this Company together.

Somehow, in my shocked state, I kept in mind that the couple in front of me did not seem to have any idea what was going on, and just thought they had been gifted a hotel stay and sporting event tickets through work. I was able to explain to them that the certificate they had didn't have anything to do with us, and that their employer also had not paid for the room (another misunderstanding, apparently), but I could check them in at the best available rate and would be able to change the rate back later this weekend if they were given the proper form. They were fine with this, and we got them set up with directions to parking and their event.

This morning during breakfast, they informed me that they received the form. At this point I know that  it's highly unlikely that they will qualify for the rate that was booked, but I help them forward the form to the hotel so that I can take a look at it. I did, and politely explained that it just wasn't valid for the rate that was booked. The couple said they would let their boss know.

It was a family form, with the boss named as the person on the form, and his daughter being the hotel employee. Ignoring the part about the first rule on the rate form stating ""the person on the form being the only person who can use the form,"" he's giving his daughter's employee discount out to his own employees, and that probably wasn't the best idea.

682,English isn't necessarily English,"A recent post about cribs reminded me of this story.

My American cousin is visiting the UK with 2 kids.  They book with an American hotel chain, to stay at an airport hotel in London.  Additional request is placed for 2 cribs for the kids.

Arriving at the hotel, the kids are tired, its way past their bedtime and they are starting to get cranky,  Get to the room and there are no cribs.  

Cousin phones the front desk - ""I requested 2 cribs, they aren't here, can you send them up please?""

FD - ""of course madam, they will be up shortly""

40 mins go by.  Kids are by now screaming and crying with tiredness.

Cousin phones the desk again ""where are my cribs?  The kids are tired out & we need them badly""

FD - ""So sorry madam, they are on the way up now""

Knock on the door, which cousin answers, to find a room service guy with a tray, and 2 packets of chips on it.  Cousin stares at the tray, and back to the room service guy, and finally works it out

""I said CRIBS, not CRISPS"".

683,Sneaky Sneaky,"Just had to kick out my first room in the year that i have worked here. 

Lady pulls up in a uhail at 630am reeking of cigarette smoke (ewww). Rates are still pretty high so they didnt want to pay what it was. She goes back outside and i think thats the end of it. 

I have one guest leave said hes checking out but i forget what room hes in so i just let hsk deal with it when they check rooms at noon. 

She comes back in with a key card saying ""her friend gave me his card saying i could go to his room"" 

Ummm what friend??? ( im very suspicious at this point) 

""The room is 225""

Usually if they have the key and know what the room is we dont really stop them from entering a room. However i remember checking this guy in and he had not mentioned anyone else coming to his room. 

She goes up the first time. I quickly check the system and check his room out. Also tried calling the guest to verify if it was ok for them to use the room. But his inbox was full. 

Just so many red flags going off telling me i had fucked up by letting her go up the first time. 

Dude is from out of state and they suddenly pull up at 630 in the morning needing a room. 

I stop her when she comes back telling her shes not going to be able to access that room. The guy who was in it has already checked out for the day. And due to hotel policy we cannot allow for someone to have access to a room thats already been checked out. 

She was like "" oh i thought they got to keep the room till a certain time?"" 
I say they do but if they have left the building they are automatically checked out for the day and the room is no longer accessible. And due to hotel policy you are going to have to vacate the room. 

Lady- oh. Well i just wanted to take a shower. You cant let me do that? I left something in the room. 

No i cant it goes against policy. I can go get it but youll have to leave. I ask what she left she said she had a friend in the room. 

I didnt even see this guy come in the building (was not the same guest who originally had the room) 

I get to the room knock say front desk. This dude making himself comfortable already. Asked if what they did was illegal and if i had called the cops.

So i  go up and get him out and escort both out of the building. (Thank god they didnt throw a bitch fit. Could have turned into a much worse situation). 

Honestly i really dont know if it was illegal or not. No i didnt call the cops. As long as they were being civil i was ok to do it myself. I felt because the guest didnt know them it would have been a liability if i had let them stay. Not to mention that they may have tried to stay past check out. 

Also kind of felt like they were trying to get a free room by using someones ""left overs"". 

They asked if they could rent that room they borrowed i had to say no. (Come on ppl its still rona time) then asked if they could eat the breakfast. Again i had to say no cause they were no guest. 

I escorted them out the door and sent them on their way. 

Idk yall do you think i did it correctly? Or could have went bout it a different way?",16,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEF7F1F0>
684,Broken Pack N’ Play,"The front desk manager called me to inform me of a very irate guest complaining about the two cribs delivered to her room were both broken. 

I immediately went to their room to show them how to set them up and show that they are functional and not broken. 95% of those who complain about the Pack N’ Play being broken just don’t know how to set them up properly. 

The guest refused to have me show it to them how to set it up. 

I brought her another one which she appreciated and then as soon as they closed the door behind me, I immediately set up the crib they claim is broken and left it outside their door for them to see!",16,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEF7F520>
685,The tale of Santa’s kidnapping.,"In our restaurant at the wait station, we have a five foot Santa with a Christmas tree holding a lantern.

Today at around 1:30 am Santa was no longer at his station. Confused by this our janitor came up and told me and security about it. 

Onto watching the cameras, a favorite pastime. So as we’re skipping through the evening we see Santa there, and then he’s gone. So we slow it down and go back a minute. This dude (we will call him future felon) walks up to Santa gives him a few tugs to see if he’s nailed down, picks him up and heads to the door, sees another bar customer in front of the door and puts Santa back. 

Future felon comes back five minutes later, his buddy rips the lights out of Santa’s back and then mr future felon Tries to carry Santa out like a back pack, stumbles over himself and then figures under his arm is the ticket as he rushes out the door.

Well now we have the Santa napper on camera in low and high definition (one camera is crap and the other is new glorious).

I call the police non emergency, and get transferred to a mildly sleepy officer who asks me the value of Santa (it’s about 1200$), the guys name (I don’t know but I do know his brothers name) and his friends name which I do know. He has me email him the video, and all the known facts of the future felon. 

Cue two hours later my security guard has the brother of mr future felon on the phone telling us that he went to his brothers house, beat his brother up and took Santa back. He was calling from the road trying to figure out what he should do with Santa cause he’s now in possession of stolen property. I told him to take it back to his brother and leave it with him.

As we hang up with the brother in comes the officer to talk to us about what’s going on, the brother calls back to talk to us again and to try and return Santa cause his brother is now claiming it was just a joke. The officer gets mr future felons name and address from the brother who doesn’t want anything to do with his brothers future felony. 

The officer drives directly to the house, gets Santa back and hands the future felon a ticket to appear in court. He also informs mr future felon that he is now trespassed from the property and if he shows up he will go to jail directly.

We have our Santa back, his tree and lamp no longer light up, and his glasses are broken but he is back where he belongs.",30,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEF7F670>
686,2 Odd calls,"1st call.  12:05 AM.

I get a call from a lady who asks if we have bibles in EVERY room.  This is from an outside line, btw....  I go, yes, we should, although I can't say that every room CURRENTLY has one, as sometimes they are taken and not restocked, but we should have them.  She then tells me she has forgotten hers, and wants me to go up to room 323 (very specific) and see if there is a Bible in that room.  I was getting crazy vibe before, and now it is full on crazy blaring at me from the phone.

I tell her, ""No.  What?  You think I'm going to go up to a room in the middle of the night just to see if there is a Bible in it?  Ma'am, I don't have time for prank calls."" and I hang up.

Kinda surprised she didn't call back.  Either her crazy addled brain somehow thought, ""Well, they must worship Santa at that hotel"" or maybe it was a very very dumb attempt to get me to leave the front desk for some reason.  

2nd call - 20 minutes later.

""Hi, are you guys pet friendly?""

""I'm sorry, no, we are not.  You might try OTHER BRAND(tm) hotel, I'm pretty sure they do.""

""OK.  Thank you for your honesty"".  *click*.

687,Is this even safe ?,"So after my post about letting masses come in to warm up the other night, I come in tonight to find out that our central heat is out of order. We're using three electric heaters at the front desk and our fireplace but then over by the doors, they have a propane heater. As the evening FDA was going over how to replace the propane tank when it ran out, I asked ""aren't propane heaters like... bad for indoor use?"" but he kind of just shrugged and pointed out how much the temperature would drop once it went out. So off he went into the night and I just kind of went back to my usual night audit routine, not really thinking anything more about it. Then, five hours into my shift, I notice the heater is out and the tank needs to be switched. It's not something I've ever done but the process seemed pretty straight forward, turn off/close tank a, detach tank a, hook up tank be, turn on/open tank b. The tricky part came when I had to restart the heater/ignite the propane. I turned it on and it didn't want to light right away. Now I've been called Chicken Little in the past for my proneness to overreact to things but I'm pretty sure after about thirty seconds of not getting the thing started while it was a'blowing away, I'm pretty sure I was smelling a significant amount of gas. So I panicked, turned off the heater, closed off the tank, and opened the doors to air the lobby out, which let a lot of the remaining heat out. After it seemed like the lobby was aired out and was thoroughly freezing, I tried again and was able to get the heater lit and running. Now my paranoia is in full swing though and I'm trying to figure out how realistic the threat of carbon monoxide poisoning while I or any of our FD staff ‏‏‎ are sitting here in the lobby for an eight hour shift with this heater running about three tanks of propane a day with minimal ventilation is. Wish me luck on not going full fledged hypochondriac while I Google the symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning...",13,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEF7FD90>
688,"For those that asked, My sports team stories.","As a precursor, I have been told by my hiring manager, the OPs manager that replaced her, my GM, and my FDM at my old hotel that their favorite thing about me is I dont take shit from the guests.

The Hockey Team: 

We had, as most hotels do at some point, a couple hockey teams inhouse for a nearby tourney. I am a forever NA so get to deal with them on my own. My PM fills me in that they are being a pain, trashing the coffee/tea/hot chocolate station, running around, being loud, etc...

Within the first hour I warn them twice about being loud in the halls, but of course they dont care, so I call the rooms. (they had charged snacks to the rooms so I knew them) their parents answer and I give the last warning. ""If I get one more issue I will have to remove them and you from the property."" ""yea OK we'll tell them to chill""

Now I hear nothing for over an hour until this top tier member that i just checked in comes to the desk telling me that some boys were saying ""vulgar things"". i ask her to be specific.

these shits had dragged the mattress out of the room into the hall and were laying there. when the woman went to go down the hall they stated ""what you never seen 3 guys sharing a bed before you homophobic cunt?""

i wen to the corner and saw them in the hall laughing in the bed. i returned to the desk, called the non emergent cop number, and when the cops showed up about 5 minutes late i led them to the boys. the kids faces went white as we walked up to them and the cops each took a kid. they ""cop knocked"" on the doors and when the parents answered i told them all to get out.

""but we paid already for the whole weekend!""

""too bad, its non refundable, your kids are disgusting, and you are not welcome here anymore. if you set foot on the property, these nice folks will arrest you on the spot.""

they had to walk, with all their shit, almost a mile down the road to another hotel, pay the obscenely high rack rate, and had to call the coach to make the bus go pick them up. the kids and parents were so wiped that the team lost the game and fell out of the tourney.

&#x200B;

The Washout Baseball Team:

we had a highschool tourney going on for a week that summer, we had no problems until the second to last day. around 1:30 am i hear water spraying. i think its the sprinkler but they aren't going when i look out the window, so i follow the sound. around the corner on the first floor the sprinkler is pouring water onto the floor, there are a bunch of kids sitting in the hall looking scared shitless, 3 soaked, 1 holding his arm to his chest, and a bat with the sprinkler gear stuck in it.

cops called, FD shuts it down, EMTs take arm kid to the hospital with a fracture and 1 of the other soaked kids for a concussion.

cops get the whole story in the lobby as i listen.

the kids were playing ""can you touch it?"" where they run down the hall and jump to hit the light, sign, sensor. they were using their hands, but the little guy, (hurt arm) couldn't reach any of the things, so used the bat, at a full sprint. 

""but he only meant to tap it""

well he smacked the gear, hurt his wrist/arm, the other kids tried to yank the bat down, ripped the gear off, and one of them got brained with the bat.

i had to relocate the whole first floor, so i kicked out the rooms that the kids belonged to to have enough, which was the whole team.

as my FDM had to come in because of the severity of the call, me and him cleaned the rooms on the upper floors that the team left for the moved guests.

i also heard that the parents or the team was charged like $25,000.00 for the new carpets, furniture, drywall, plumber, and the techs to fix the elevators as water had gone down the shaft.

they were banned from the property, slept either in the bus or at the hospital, and a few were doing the ""belt walk"" as they left.

i have a few more stories, most are about me throwing out the crazy shit. tell me if anyone wants more",47,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEF7F910>
689,“I can’t believe IM the one with the brain tumor”,"Here’s a therapeutic rant about how my Saturday went. I worked the 7-3 shift and everything is going smoothly. Checkout time is at 11am for us and guests are leaving the hotel. (M - ME, G - Guest)

There’s not a soul in the lobby until this older man comes inside from the parking lot and he throws his room key at me and I already have a sense on how this interaction is going to go. Before I could ask him any sort of question, he says

G - “It’s ME. REMEMBER? I’m bringing down my stuff to my car. I’m in pain and I have a brain tumor and spinal problems. I need my receipt! YOU CHARGED MY CARD $100 DOLLARS.”

I was very confused as I haven’t had any type of interaction with this guest, or even seen him at that. My welcoming smile slowly faded to a frown. 

M - “I’m sorry I don’t remember you but that $100 is an incidental hold and I can get a receipt printed out for you though it will be blank since nothing was charged to the card.”

I think this is where the stick in his ass started to itch because he then said,

G - “I don’t NEED a receipt.” 

…what 

So trying to find a solution so he could respectfully fuck off, I replied 

M - “Oh okay. We’re you looking to check out then?”

..wrong question apparently. 

G - “NO. I am NOT “cHecKinG oUt”! I need to get back into my ROOM I still have my stuff in there!” 

M - “Okay well then here’s your key back, you’re going to need this to get back into the room” 

G - “Do you know how to LISTEN?! I told you that I need my key remade! It’s not working!!”

M - “Alright well give me one second and I will remake this for you”

*Guest scoffs*

G - “Seriously? I can’t believe that IM the one with the brain tumor. This is ridiculous. So absurd. Your job isn’t that hard. All you have to do is LISTEN-“

I pass him the key and cut him off from his brewing rant. 

M - “Here you go sir. Now you can get back into the room”

Guest rips the key out of my hand 

G - “Wow. You’re completely incompetent.”

*walks away*

So this is the part where my nice fake customer service flies out the window. I understand the respect and understanding to give to guests but I am so over people getting away with treating us workers like shit and then walking over us like rugs. 


The guest gets the rest of his belongings and makes his way back down to the lobby to bring his things outside. When he makes it halfway passed the front desk he says 

G - “I’m sorry. I’m dealing with a lot of stress and a lot of pain from my spinal cord and lungs and brain tumor and blahblahblah”

M - “Oh no worries, that’s okay! :)”

G - “No… it’s not okay. It’s not okay what YOU did.”

M - “I’m sorry? What did I do?”

G - “I’m not apologizing to YOU. You don’t deserve an apology”

I laugh loud enough for him to hear.

M - “Lol okay” 

The guest is halfway out of the doors when he gains the courage to say,

G - “You really need to LISTEN to people” 

I’m so over him at this point. 

M - “Well it would be helpful if you EXPLAINED yourself.”

I was so upset because I genuinely didn’t do anything wrong, and I let him push me out of my character. I am NEVER rude to guests that speak like this but today was the day. 


He comes back to the desk after loading up his car. He stands in front of me for a minute saying the same thing about his pain, stress, body problems and brain tumor. I’m not sure how true this is but I ignored his spiel and said,

M - “Okay so are you checking out?”

G - “Yes. I want my receipt”

So i go to print off the receipt and he continues..

G - “You know, when you’re working you really need to shut your mind off to outside influences and LISTEN to guests. When a customer approaches the desk, you need to shut up and listen.”

M - “Oh no, here’s the thing, I did listen to everything you said and not once did you mention anything about getting a key remade because if you did, I wouldn’t have been so confused.”

G - “YES I DID I came to you and the FIRST thing I said was that I needed my key remade because it’s not working.”

Me not trying to prolong this fight and taking a brain tumor into consideration replied

M - “Alright. Well here’s your receipt”

He continues to try to argue with me and I just talk over him by saying,

M - “Here you go.”

G - “But you—“

M- “Here’s your receipt”

G - “I told you—“

M - “Right here, there’s the receipt.”

He realizes that I’m not going to continue this pointless argument and takes a look at the receipt.

G - “WELL WHERES THE 100$ CHARGE ON HERE?!”

Good. Fucking. God.

M - “There’s no charge, it was a hold and I have released that back to your card now that I have you checked out in the system.”

G - “Oh okay.. thanks.”

M - “You’re welcome, have a good day.”

He just stood there for what felt like eternity but was probably only 10-20 seconds and then says the most Karen thing I’ve heard so far.

G - “Everybody knows my name from famous people to talk show hosts. I have documentaries made about me and I’m always on tv. Everybody knows who I am.”

Okay super special 3rd party discounted reservation. 

M - “Have a nice day” 

He looked surprised that I didn’t run around the desk, bow down, and shine his shoes. I was so happy he left and my manager let me black list him. :)",30,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEF7F490>
690,About lodging complaints to FDAs,"My location has been under construction for a few months now, so the complaints I get have only been going up. It's been stressful with the renovation and I needed to vent a little.

Anyways, this is a problem I run into semi frequently as a FDA, but it has gotten significantly worse with the construction. It feels like whenever a guest tells you about a problem they're having, they act like you are the one you caused the problem and should be able to fix it. I understand that they're frustrated, but unless it directly has to do with a guest being checked in, checked out or billed then I probably have nothing to do with it. I will do my best to help anyone with any problem they might be having, but ultimately my position is FDA and that's it.

If your TV or AC isn't working I'll gladly go and take a look at it for you and do my best to fix it, but I'm not matinence. I don't have the tools, training or experience to fix something like that. Most I can do is move you to a different room if we have any available or talk to my GM about a potential discount/partial refund.

If housekeeping didn't clean your room after you requested them to I can get you new towels, sheets, take out your garbage, etc. But what I can't do is actually clean your room, I'm not housekeeping. I'm not familiar with room cleaning procedure and I'm not paid to clean rooms. I'm not responsible for making sure housekeeping cleans your room either (I work PM and NA shifts so housekeeping is usually gone before I come in), if I put the note in that you wanted your room cleaned and it doesn't happen that has nothing to do with me.

One of my ""favourite"" situations is when a guest complains about the price, whether its after they've checked in or before they make the reservation. I have no control over what our rates are, it doesn't matter if you found a similar hotel for a lower price. That doesn't change anything. I also can't lower the price just because you asked me nicely or said pretty please. I would rather not jeopardize my job so that you can save $20 on your hotel bill. 

TL;DR - There's nothing wrong with lodging a complaint to the FDA, but don't assume they're the one who caused the problem or that they'll always be able to fix it.",11,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEF7F190>
691,The day before my last day I finally met The One,"TLDR: I finally got to call a guest an asshole to his face and it felt amazing. 10/10 would recommend.  


I've been working the front desk at this property for about 10 years; FOS for the last 3 years and NA for most of the rest. Three weeks ago I put in my notice and I just knew at that time that I wouldn't be able to keep my attitude to myself with the knowledge that I'll be gone in a few weeks anyway. I wasn't going to go out of my way to be rude, but if a guest was shitty to me I knew that I would probably be mouthy back to them.   


The next three weeks went by uneventfully. Now it's Saturday night. I've got one more shift tomorrow afternoon which will be extremely quiet and chill no doubt. We have some activity in the hotel, but it's not exactly super packed and I'm not really slammed. I came in to about 60 arrivals most of which got in before the wedding shuttles left about 2 hours after my shift started. I work by myself these days thanks to pandemic staffing. No big deal.  


And then he came. My White Whale. The man who would be The One to draw out my sass and my condescension. In this tale I will be ""ME"" the man from room 526 will be ""Class act"" or ""CA"" for short.  


It's about 9:30pm. The phone at the desk rings.  


ME: ""Front Desk this is OP speaking.""  
CA: ""Hey I just turned on the AC in here and the fan sounds like a truck is driving through my room! It \*literally\* feels like it's going to explode!""  


A pretty common complaint, to be honest. I think that's true no matter where you are. Some people just aren't used to having the AC unit in the room with them. He didn't need to be so hyperbolic, but that's not going to ruffle my feathers by itself.  


I start to give him my standard reply.  


ME: ""OK, so ... ""  
CA: ""I don't want any bullshit comments! And I don't want you condescending to me either!""  


I pause. I admit I'm a bit disarmed by the way he's started with me. I learn later that at check-in he had commented to me about how busy the hotel was and I corrected him saying that we were only at 50%. It seems he have taken offense to that and remembered that interaction from 6 hours prior. I'm thinking that my stock reply to his problem would easily fall under the category of ""bullshit comment"" (I usually offer to move their room or have an engineer come take a look, but explain that we use the same units in all the rooms and that might not significantly reduce the noise level) so I go to a different stock answer. Whenever someone does not want any of the solutions I have to offer I ask:  


ME: ""OK. So what solution do you want me to offer you?""  
CA: ""You're being a little asshole right now!""  


And there he was. I'd finally found him. Without hesitation I replied in the most natural and honest way I could unfettered by fear of consequences.   


ME: ""You're being an asshole too.""  
CA: ""I'm being an asshole?!""  
ME: ""Yes. You are. Would you like to me offer you any solutions for your AC?""  


He begins popping off about how hard he's going to come after me and blah blah blah. I inform him that my last day is tomorrow and I don't care. He hangs up.  


Less than a minute later he's in the lobby. He's come around the desk to get close to me. I stay where I am. I don't even turn to face him. My hands stay in my pockets. My tone is still calm and even. I have him pegged as the kind of guy who's all bluster and he doesn't seem drunk enough to do anything stupid.  


CA: ""You wanna be a tough guy now?! Call me an asshole again.""  
ME: ""You're an asshole.""  
CA: ""Oh you're a tough guy huh? Call me an asshole again!""  
ME: ""You're an asshole.""  


Yes, he asked me twice, and twice I obliged.   


He tells me he wants to talk to a manger. I explain that I am a manager and that there is no one else working the desk. I ask him one more time if he wants me to do anything about his AC as he runs off to the bar to find literally anyone else to complain too. Then he returns and leans against the desk glaring at me.  


CA: ""Later when you leave I'm going to get you in the parking lot. Oh yea believe it!""  
ME: ""Oh yea? You're gonna stand there until my shift ends? Okay then.""  


I take out my phone and bring up the local police's number which I still have saved from all my years working NA. If he's going to threaten me that blatantly I don't have any issue skipping my normal 3-strike system and going straight for the nuclear option. I'm moments away from pushing the call button when the banquet manager arrives. I genuinely like this manager. He's reliable and generally very pleasant to work with, so I do feel bad that he now has to talk to this shithead. He also holds absolutely no authority over me nor anything that happens at the Front Desk.  


The version of events that CA gives to the banquet manager is truly incredible. By CA's telling of the story he called the desk to complain about the AC noise and then I immediately just started calling him an asshole. And then he came down to the desk and I called him an asshole three more times! I'm staying quiet just smiling. The banquet manager offers to have his room moved which CA immediately accepts. I make him new keys and he goes on his way.  


My shift ends in a few minutes and once my relief arrives I plan to call the local police anyway just to get me to my car. The cops here are pretty chill and usually have plenty of time for stuff like that.",25,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEF7FD00>
692,"""What floor is room 210 on?""","Yep, the title says it all. LOL

So I'm working a rare second shift today as a favor to a colleague and the level of weirdness and craziness is about the same as a Saturday night shift. One thing I've noticed so far this evening is that there are a whole lot more food delivery people coming in than I usually see at night, which leads into today's story.

A young Door Dash driver came in about 20 minutes ago and comes up to the front desk and asks ""what floor is 210 on?"" Of course, my first thought is 'seriously dude? Isn't the 2 in 210 a dead giveaway?' Wanting to sarcastically say '4th floor' to see if he'd believe me, I tell him 210 is on the second  floor, while trying hard not to laugh. As he walks away, I do chuckle to myself and just shake my head in wonderment.

Has this genius never been in a hotel before? Did the high school he went to only have one floor? Has he never been to visit anyone in a hospital? Usually the first number of a room (first two numbers for floors 10 to 99) on a multi-floor building indicates what floor a room is on.

Anyway, I did get a good chuckle out of it and it made the evening a wee bit 'brighter.'

Have a great Saturday night everyone!! :\~)",22,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEF7FFA0>

694,Am i normal or just not made for this job.,"I started as a FDA agent 2 days ago in this big luxury chain hotel, 800+ rooms, right at the centre of the city, my collegues have all 20 years+ experience, very fast with the tasks, and im just there taking this big load of information. 
I’ve already worked in AR for two years, not the same hotel but the same chain, but I’ve never done front of the house type of job. It’s overwhelming. Two days in and i can’t do a check in, or check out, its not that i can’t its just that i feel overwhelmed and kind of scared. 
Yesterday a coworker was check in a guest, i hopped in to help her with activating the keys while she was posting the parking, she told me in front of the guest and another collegue :< you should focus more on the check in i didn’t ask you to do MY keys>. I get it she’s right, but i was just trying to help and learn at the same time, and why she got to tell me that in that way infront of everybody. It kinda hurt my feelings because im already under so much pressure ( living alone in a foreign country ect).
Im scared that i could never improve myself, i already feel the introvert bubble forming around me, should i quit? Please any advice will help. Thnks",27,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEF7FB50>
695,"Do not slip, it's not water, it's piss.........","Hello friends, hope everyone is having as great of a night and Christmas as I am having!!!!!! CAN YOU TELL HOW HAPPY I AM!!!!!!!

So I run a small motel, it is an outdoor one and we do not have public bathrooms, the only bathroom we have is in the laundry room and that is shared amongst the frontdesk and housekeepers only. The property had issues with letting guests use it in the past so they've given us strict instructions to not allow anyone to use except staff and this was before COVID so it's even worse now.

So it's Friday night, hitting close to 4 am, everyone is leaving clubs and trying to find rooms to handle their business for the night. I am sold out of rooms by this point. 

Enter Wh\*\*\* S\*\*\* BI\*\*\* C\*\*\* no.1 and  Wh\*\*\* S\*\*\* BI\*\*\* C\*\*\* no.2, lets call them neon (wearing a skin tight dress that is legit neon green, this bitch glows in the dark) and bodysuit (dont need to explain that one :P) 

They come into the lobby screaming, shouting, drunk and demand that I give them room, she has already thrown her credit card and ID at me before I can even say anything. So I kindly push back the ID and credit card and let them know that I do not have a room available and that I am sold out, which they would have known if they paid attention to SOLD OUT SIGN on the fucking DOOR to the lobby! 

They start talking and saying that they have worked in hotels before and all hotels keep at least 1 or 2 rooms on standby due to any emergency. I stare at them and I'm thinking ""what fucking hotel would purposefully not sell rooms and what hotels need to keep rooms for emergencies, what are these so called emergencies??????"" I repeat that I am sorry and that I do not have a room for them, they start getting mad and telling me that I just don't want to rent them a room, and if I was to rent them a room, they both would take care of me after my shift (wtf never have I been insulted and then had sexual advances made against me, first time for everything I guess) I am still trying to maintain my professionalism and state to them that there is no room and they can try their luck at the million other hotels that are less than a mile away from here. 

So now they start telling me to find them a hotel room, and I tell them I am not doing that, and then they finally ask to use the bathroom. Same thing I tell them that I do not have a public bathroom, now is when they start to actually get mad at me and start calling me names cause I do not want to help out women who are in need, and that I am being sexist, and that I could have had both of them if I wasnt such a bitch. Bruh I am getting to my boiling point now, I raise my voice and tell them that they have no reason to be in lobby anymore and need to leave immediately!

Bodysuit walks out but neon makes her way over to the far end of my lobby near the coffee machine, I ask her again ""ma'am you need to leave"" and she's standing there awkwardly staring at me and I am like wtf is this lady doing! After a good 45 seconds she slowly walks towards the door and walks out, as they are both getting into their car, they flip me off and I gladly returned the finger and they drove off. 

Now I am standing there just wondering why did she walk to the coffee machine, it's off and why was she just looking at me weird. So I am like fuck it, I walk out the office and go over and as I am approaching the machine, the smell hits me, THIS BITCH PISSED ON THE FLOOR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! My housekeepers walk in like 2 mins later since their shift ended and see me standing there in complete shock as to how an adult can act like this, I tell them to back up a little bit and watch out so they dont slip in the piss. We spent the next 30 mins mopping and spraying the whole lobby down with bathroom cleaner and air freshener. I fucking done, I am going on holiday in 2 days for a week, I just need to get through the next 2 days.....Please to whatever higher power there is do not let anyone test me in the next 2 days cause I am at my limit!",34,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEF7FB80>
696,Christmas Party from Hell,"(I wrote a brief summary of this Christmas party in a comment on someone else's post. I decided to go into more detail since everyone seems to be telling their stories. This was also the party from right before COVID.)

I was one of the employees who usually always went to the Christmas party. Our old management company would have it at another hotel. Catered, open bar and good DJ. Was pretty fun. Then our Hotel got sold to another company. The new company did not want to give us a Christmas party because there have been bad experiences from their other hotels. Our GM finally convinced them to do it. She also decided, for some God forsaken reason, it was a good idea to have the party at our hotel. I smelled the trouble from a mile away. So I decided to skip out on it and cover the night audit instead. Big mistake!! Here are some highlights from that night. Not that this matters but my GM is a female.

\-GM tried to sexually assault another female coworker who was passed out drunk. (another employee got her upstairs and put her to bed. I did not see this but it was reported to me the next day.) 

\-GM stole alcohol from the bar

\-GM raffled off a TV that was bought by our owners for a guest room

\-GM drove 3 employees to McDonalds while drunk

\-GM had a threesome with 2 other employees

\-GM and a few other employees were smoking weed in one of the guest rooms

\-I had to chase a few employees out of the kitchen because they were trying to cook while drunk

\-I had so many noise complaints from that night.

The next Monday this was all reported to corporate  by other managers. I went in to give my statement about all I had seen. The GM was suspended at first but fired the next day after a full investigation. We got parties banned for all the hotels owned by our management company.",24,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEF7F6D0>
697,Finally have a scam story!,"NA here at a Shmotel Fix somewhere in what I lovingly refer to as ""Calabama.""

Got a call while on shift last night from someone claiming 1) to be one of the owners of the motel (I know my boss *and his family* own the property, so it seemed like it might be legit) and 2) to have my boss on the other line.

Classic FedEx package delivery scheme that's been described here a thousand times. Nothing ended up happening, fortunately, because:

1) I have no money to send anyone right now

2) My AGM (who is fantastic) showed up and told me that it was a scam and to hang up and block the dude's phone number.

I'm not in trouble or anything, thankfully, but I am annoyed that I fell for it even partially.",33,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEF7F700>
698,"""I'm a veteran, senior, disabled, have a teenager, AAA, AARP, ADA, government what's my discount?""","We have a semi-regular guest named Mr. Peaches who is more sour than sweet but has a good heart from what I can tell. He rents multiple rooms at a time so he and his family can watch his grandson play tennis. It is however such a pain to check him in because we go through the same routine Every. Single. Time. 

I glance at the cameras and see an elderly man scoping out rooms where our boilers are and I recognize him it's Mr. Peaches. I haven't seen him in about 6 months so a bit surprised. Sometimes he'll stay a few times a week, sometimes weeks apart but it is always the same routine. I head to the terminal to see what rooms I have available and brace myself for what is about to happen.

First, he walks in and lists all the discounts he's ever qualified for with some occasional news ones: church board member, rewards status from other brands, Chili's gift card, and on I can't remember them all. He asks what all his eligible discounts ""add up to"". He knows they don't stack because once I offer the most generous one I can he'll comment about the rate going up/down depending on season. This time our rates are down which of course he knew even after his opening salvo.

Second, he will demand rooms near our boilers because he believes his water and room heat will be better than anywhere else on our property which isn't true. We have a room map placed right near the night window and all Mr. Peaches sees is all the bountiful options he has near our boilers--it even shows adjoining rooms which is what he always requests. Sometimes he'll ask for 3 rooms with adjoining doors which we don't have. I don't think any hotel offers that but I may be wrong.

In reality sometimes people are staying in one of the adjoining rooms, sometimes rooms are down, sometimes rooms are reserved, and in our case a lot of rooms are OOO due to delays in our renovations a la COVID. Sometimes the hotel gods are merciful and I'll have Mr. Peaches requested rooms available the first time. Not this time, not usually in fact. Instead he'll run through all the adjoining rooms in that area and today we had none available. 

We did have some across the courtyard ready but they are too far from our boilers for Mr. Peaches. What I did have near there were 2 rooms NOT adjoining which I told him at the beginning but that didn't prevent him from running down the list of adjoining rooms in that area. After we got done with that he accepted the 2 non adjoining rooms close to the boilers. 

Lastly he will give me a lengthy update about his grandsons progress and depending on time of year this can last for several minutes which is a long time if there is a queue forming not that that prevents Mr. Peaches from delivering a detailed progress report. Today there was no one behind him but luckily there wasn't too much chit chat.",72,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEF7F8B0>

700,"Holiday Party. Bah, humbug Chapitre deux","Skwrl and Buttercup have their most excellent thread about being an employee not wanting to do a holiday party.  I am currently among that group as well.  As night auditor, I'd rather sleep than go to a tired, derivative, boring, same-old same-old ""party"".  Especially one that is ""paid for"" by the employees (pot luck) and have a ""white elephant"" which means pretty much that almost everyone will get something they don't want.

From the other end, wanted to share my Bah Humbug holiday story from the other side, from the time I was a General Manager.

I was a GM for a 150 room hotel for about 6 1/2 years.  Which means about 30 employees all told, give or take.  For years, I went to the same old Christmas party at different locations doing the exact same thing.  Catered or pot luck food.  White elephant that took way too long and people were tired and wanted to go home.

For the 1st year I was GM at that hotel, I decided, I wanted to do what (in my mind) was a Christmas party ""done right"".  Meaning, it was supposed to be a big ""thank you"" to my employees, and that meant a personal touch.

Which means, I took what was allowed by my hotel for a party, bought specific presents myself for employees, and bought GROCERIES so I that I could cook dinner myself for them.  

1st year, I had flambéed chicken in a cognac cream pan sauce, cheesecake crepes with blueberry compote, beans with almonds, brown sugar carrots, salad, soup and some home-made potato dish I can't recall.  Spent hours at home prepping and getting things to be able to cook in our small kitchen at work.

Less than 1/2 my employees showed up.  

The next year was close to the same.  I had fillet of beef that year, home-made stuffing, fruit parfait, and a couple other items.

Again - less than 1/2 the people showed up.  And, I heard through the grapevine that a couple of the people who did show up apparently thought so little of the food that they commented to someone else at their table, ""He's not as good a cook as he thinks he is."".

Which - while this may be true - was incredibly rude and ungrateful, and really upset me.

So much so that for the other 4 years I was there, for Christmas instead of spending the money allocated for a party, I split it up evenly and gave out gift certificates instead.  

Unsurprisingly, no one ""missed"" the party and if they did, got over it pretty quickly.  

I rarely go to these kinds of work functions any more, and thankfully (unlike Skwrl) haven't had anyone try and force me to go.  But I'll always remember how ungrateful people can be for a Gm trying to do right by them, as much as I recall management just throwing a boring ""party"" because they feel they have to and put absolutely no thought or effort into it.",22,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEFE9130>
701,"Holiday Party? Bah, Humbug.","Less of a Tale tonight and more of a rant, but mostly just letting folks know I'm still here.

Tonight gentle readers, we shall speak of that most sacred of holiday traditions: the annual Christmas party. Buttercup is in her usual spot by the coffee station. Don't let the antlers fool you, she's still a unicorn.

Like many companies, my hotel has an annual Christmas party: potluck food, white elephant gift exchange, a raffle for a new TV every year, all that sort of thing.

I make a point of not attending.

The housekeepers have a very bad habit of turning '+1' into 'bring the entire family', which turns a small gathering of coworkers into a swarm of undisciplined children and people I don't know. Even when they're told very explicitly not to. The kids will be running around screaming, because they are bored, while the other family members will sit around sullenly, also bored.

The food will be devoured almost immediately. The last time I attended the only thing left by the time I got there was the macaroni salad, with one person shamelessly hauling away *four* slices of the pizza *I* had brought.

But mostly, I never really see everyone else, as I'm working nights. I am extremely in fifth-wheel mode, and tired because it's usually the times I'm in bed asleep. Probably with a headache from the lack of sleep and screaming children.

So I don't go. Period. I'd rather get the sleep.

In the past, I have contributed to the white elephant gift exchange, despite not attending. This means I usually wind up with the random crap nobody else wants. Scented candles. Automatic putter. That stupid fragrance oil you spray in your toilet. That sort of thing. Last time I participated, I dropped off a *large* wrapped package, containing an covered turkey pan.

But I stopped bothering, because again, not really worth the effort and expense.

Year before last, the AGM took charge of the whole event, determined to make it the best holiday party ever. To this end, she posted a notice, where folks could indicate which of the *approved* items we would be bringing to the potluck, as well as reminding that participation in the gift exchange would be **mandatory** (bolding hers), with a minimum of $25 for the gift. I ignored it, as well as the second reminder that *some people* had not confirmed for the party.

Fun fact: Skwrl does NOT do passive aggressive memos, and will ignore them completely. This includes a third memo in an envelope with my name on it, taped up in the back room.

So finally, she confronted me directly about it.

""So... I still need you to sign up for the potluck and gift exchange. You've had two weeks now.""

""No, I'm not going.""

""You need to bring something, or it's not fair to everyone else.""

""Sorry, but no. I do not go to the holiday party. At all. Ever.""

""You still *need* to bring a gift for the exchange. It's *mandatory*...""

\*drawing myself up to my full height\* ""*No.*""

""It's the *rules*. If you don't, you'll get written up.""

\*Spock eyebrow\* ""Go ahead then. I advise you to document everything very carefully and completely.""

Apparently she tried to do exactly that. The manager was not pleased and hastily corrected her. No, Skwrl doesn't do the party. No, he doesn't have to participate. No, you can't write him up for it. No, nobody else has to participate if they don't want to. I'm pretty sure he saw the potential hefty lawsuit for trying, as he sent me a text apologizing on her behalf. Not that she ever did herself, mind you.

The memo in the back office was changed, with the mandatory participation elements replaced with snide remarks about Christmas spirit and  '**NOT PARTICIPATING**' (again, bold hers) next to my name.

Now don't get me wrong. I love Christmas and parties therof. But not at work. And certainly not when forced.

Take another minute to say goodnight to Buttercup, folks.

Teal Deer; Skwrl's hotel throws crap parties, former AGM tries to force him to attend.

Addendum: forgot to mention that I told my manager that if I had been forced to buy a present, I would have invested in twenty-five bucks worth of top quality steer manure, and added a bow. That's about five bags worth of bullcrap, btw.",160,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEF7F2E0>
702,Still Waiting…,"So it’s been almost month since I was posted about my conflicting feelings about possibly being promoted and I haven’t heard anything else about it since. I asked by FOM about it since you know chain of command he is the person directly above me and he also hasn’t been told anything by our GM.

The promotion to Night Supervisor needs to be approved by corporate first since my property has never had one. But I don’t need the promotion all I asked for was a raise but judging by the fact that they plan to promote me I can only assume I’ve hit the ceiling for the night auditor pay rate.

The only thing that would change with this promotion is that I would be required to come in if the other night auditor called out, but nothing else would really change. I’m starting to get pissed because I’ve been just sitting here for a month doing basically supervisor work anyways and not getting paid supervisor pay. I wouldn’t think it could take more than month to change my title and bump me up $1-2 more an hour.

EDIT: the other night auditor has only been here a month so if I quit or was fired they would really be fucked.",21,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEF7F820>
703,A little letter I just wrote to my GM,"{GM},

Got a call from (XXX)XXX-XXXX\[probably a spoofed number, but maybe not\] at around 3:45 this morning. Asked to speak with the general manager. Had a very thick accent. Mexican, I think, maybe Honduran, though I’ve only ever really chatted with the one Honduran guy who was in my old guild and that was years ago, so I could be wrong. Anyway, off topic. Conversation is as follows:

**Me**: Sorry, sir, but as it is 3:45am, our general manager is currently unavailable. Is there something I can assist you with?

**Guy**: I’m the owner.

**Me**: <Literal Laugh Out Loud> No you’re not.

**Guy**: I’m serious, this is the owner. <You could hear the frowny face.>

**Me**: No. You’re not. The owner I know would have identified himself by name and asked how I was doing, since I haven’t seen him in a while. And if he needed to speak with the GM at 3:45 IN THE MORNING, would likely have contacted our GM at home. So, again, no you’re not. So, you know, maybe try your little scam on someone who was born yesterday.

**Guy**: <Hangs up.>

So, I guess, what I’m saying, is if {Owner} calls you and says I was rude, oops, my bad. But, you know, I’m not worried that he will. Mostly just writing this in case you wanted to remind folks that there’s no way the owner’s gonna call them at a weird hour. In theory, shouldn’t have to, but after that whole thing with the safe and the fire extinguisher, I’m not so sure we wanna take chances.

Whenever he needs something he will type a message into Google translate and show me his phone. He came up to my desk today, showed the phone and it had translated the message, “can I suck your dick?”. I must have had a pretty confused look on my face cause it caused him to turn the phone around and read what he just showed me. His eyes went huge and he quickly put in a different message asking if I had a pair of scissors he could borrow. He spent a while profusely apologizing. I just laughed and told him it was okay.

705,I've longed bitched and ranted,"For 2 years and 8 months, I've bitched about everything with my job. Naturally I'm a complainer, this I know and have accepted. The time has finally come; I've put in my 2 week resignation for my Front Desk job. It has me reflecting and wanting to stay because as far as jobs go, it's the longest I've ever held. I fucked off during my teen years up to my early 20's then I buckled down with college and my front desk job. I am now 29 and finally decided to get a job in my study field. Not going lie … I am scared of leaving the only job I know and moving on. With any job my front desk title has many pro's and con's. My favorite pro being that I know this job well (besides the occasionally circumstances that can leave me speechless) and the biggest con being the guest themselves. 

I have an AS in Human Services, my background or what I based my reasoning on picking this field of study is being; I was in and out of the system growing up. Dealt with many different type of case workers and social workers. Always knew the type of case worker I didn't want to be or deal with. It's now setting in that ""maybe there is a reason they are the way they are"" and crap! I've been hired already, thus my reasoning for putting in my 2 week notice. I find myself torn between staying and going. 

I've talked to my current management and we have an agreement that if I leave on good standing; a job will be waiting for me (pending whether or not fully staffed). I like that I have that safety net to fall back on in case anything.

707,I’m just front desk.,"I am not a secretary or receptionist. Unless you are physically standing in front of me, it is not my job to track down any manager for you. If i transfer you and you get their voicemail, leave one. Or email them. 

This woman calls asking to talk to our former room sales manager about her room block for her wedding in June 2022. I gently inform her that this manager unfortunately no longer works here (as of like three months but i didn’t say that) and that the current one we have can help and talk her through everything she wants for her day. She takes it badly. 

Woman: but she was doing my rooms for me!

Me: yes, and i do apologize, however our current manager can certainly help you with anything you need or with any concerns you might have. 

Woman: i can’t believe this. We’ve been planning for months and now this. I need you to reassure me i’m going to get everything i want!

Me: alright, that’s something that does have to be discussed with sales. I can transfer you now to him. Ok?

Woman: ok!

She was very annoyed. 

A few minutes later she calls back demanding a manager because he didn’t answer the phone. She needs reassurance for her room block, everything she wants for her wedding, how she can get the bridal suite. Again, i explain i am just front desk and she does need to talk to sales about this. 

Me: i can understand this can be frustrating, but the current manager will certainly be able to talk with you and help you. 

Woman: i don’t think you do. I need a manager right now! I need to know why the manager was changed and why i wasn’t notified!

(The manager that’s here can’t help you… he’s inspecting rooms)

Me: sales manager may not be at his desk right, but would you like me to leave him a note to call you asap?

Woman: yes!

She goes on about how it’s unfair and unacceptable. I get it. It’s frustrating for the manager to change, but don’t be a phone thug and try to bully me into getting what you want. I can’t even give you what you want. The manager on duty rn can’t even help you cause the only departments he knows are front desk and housekeeping. After i hung up i went to the sales office and they were all gone, so i emailed the sales manager to call her. 

I am front desk. I can help you with a reservation, check in, check out, room types, hotel amenities, local attractions. I cannot help you with what products housekeeping uses to the clean the rooms, what the breakfast menu will be three months from now, i cannot even provide much info on meeting space or ballroom, and i cannot give rates or book those. I can’t do any of those things because it’s not my job. The only thing i can do is connect you to the correct people to help you.

Normal process since it's not a 3rd party res, check them out the next morning put the rooms on the list to clean, easy right? Wrote it all down for night shift to do after the audit. Came in today an hour ago, nope still checked in. Called owner, and he says they got a good rate because they booked that many days, they're paying for that many days. Then proceeds to berate me for telling them they won't be charged the entire stay. So I don't even know anymore.

709,I was fired from a hotel a year and a half ago I felt like it was unfair you be the judge this is my tale.. sorry for the bad English I am dyslexic.. this a rant as well…,Before I begin I have been in the hotel Industry over 10 years I only been laid off once and first time I was ever fried I felt so burned who let the bad taste in my mouth. I left a hotel job I had in AL I was raised in the south my whole life I lived in a very small town in AL that was boring I felt stuck in my life being in my 30s I wanted to travel see the world. So I look up hotel jobs on a site called coolworks because I really wanted to move in most of those hotels offered employee housing. I was tired of living in my small apartment so I was ready to commute I was interviewed by three different hotels one in Colorado one in Texas and one in Big sky Montana. Anyway after weeks of interviews i settled for the hotel in Montana I was so excited about leaving my town and everything behind to start a new life in the big sky. So I took a 33 hour drive from Alabama to Big Sky MT I split the drive up 16 hours apiece so my first stop was counseled Bluffs Iowa. Anyway I finally arrived at the hotel I had to stay in the room three days while they got the condo ready. I stayed with a nice couple which are still my friends to this day the only friends I made. Anyway after adjusting to life in big sky I was there for five months so here’s what happened I’m finally getting to that part sorry about that. But I wanted everyone to get the picture anyway I am handicapped and I work the front desk because I can’t do a lot so I Health stock checked people in all that stuff like you normally would do for a hotel. We were very slow one day and I did all my work I got on Facebook all of a sudden the assistant manager got mad at me for being on Facebook on a slow day which I know we all done it… because I’m not from around there so I kept up with friends for my state anyway two weeks later they pulled me to the side and said that they’re going to have to create an action plan for me to improve on some things. Like not transferring the phones to managers when A guess asked for a manager which makes no sense they got made over that. Then that assistant manager pointed out the Facebook incident which only happened one time she held it against me for some reason like she’s never done it. So they told me if I didn’t get on Facebook anymore and didn’t transfer phone calls to them they wouldn’t write me up. So I agreed and moved on three weeks later they had a meeting with me and let me go on the spot I was so mad so I explain to them why are they letting me go and they said that they just had to thinking I told them I said look I drove 33 hours gave up my entire life Took a wrist just to take a job for you guys you can at least not let me go over something silly. But they proceeded and said no you have two weeks to pack up your stuff and go or we’re going to evict you so I took my trip back to Alabama and I felt burned ever sense.,40,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEF63BE0>
710,Why ask for my directions if you're just going to ignore them,"3 more days at this job and I seem to get more irritated with everyone as that blessed day approaches. I had a lady call and said they're lost they're by a casino. OK I know where they are and it is very easy to mistake that highway with ours. They're literally the same name but ours is a boulevard and the road they're on is a highway. At one point they run parallel to each other right in front of our motel. Makes me wonder how they missed us to begin with. Anyway I tell them to turn around and when the road forks by a subway take a right and we're a quarter mile down the road. Easy.

About 30 minutes later I get a call from the same person and she says she thinks they're lost again. She says they're by a starbucks. ??? How, there isn't a starbucks near us. She says they're by a Fairlessview Harriot. OK They're clear across town no idea how they ended up there if they even remotely followed my directions.

That particular starbucks is in a plaza with one exit onto the street. I tell her to take a right onto the street, stay on that road and take a left at the intersection immediately after they pass a panda express. 5 lights down take another left and cross a bridge and you'll see us. That's the highway they were on when they called originally. While on the bridge our giant sign is clearly visible can't miss it.

She proceeds to ask me what direction to head in on main. I told her she doesn't need to get on main street. Just take a right out of the plaza and STAY ON THAT ROAD until they pass a panda express etc. She again says they're on main street and I tell her they in fact are not. Then she says well which way do I go on main. YOU DON'T NEED TO GET ON MAIN AT ALL ARE YOU LISTENING TO ME. I don't say that but I wanted to I just repeated the directions as clearly as I could.

She then mumbled I don't know where we are then asks which direction do they need to go--North? South? East? I tell her again what to do and they'll be headed West take a left at the light after Panda (South) until they hit the highway they were on originally take another left (East) and on the bridge you'll see our giant sign can't miss it.

She then ask again where do they go from main. *internal scream* I am out of patience so I tell them to go to the fairlessview harriot and have them draw a map or if they have a smartphone use that *click.*

When they finally arrived she was sort of side eyeing me and asked why our hotel is where it is. I felt like saying I don't know it was built before I was born sorry I didn't have a say in that decision. But I didn't I mustered all the customer service strength I have left and gave her a big smile and apologized for my ~~clear and concise~~ subpar directions and that I'm glad they made it and finished up the check-in process.

I guess it's obvious I'm an American all my directions were in relation to restaurants.",76,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEF638B0>
711,This one is sticking with me...,"So, this last Sunday we had a wedding group in house and while some of the guests were checking out that day, others were checking in. 11am came and went and some people still hadn't come down to check out, so as I always do, I check them out in the system and send them their folio so they, I guess, get the hint that it was time to leave. 

12:30 rolls around and housekeeping texts me and says that some people were still in the room. I noted it and kind of went about my day. At around 1:15pm, I get another text they're still there. 2pm finally comes and there's no doubt that these people need to leave. So I went up to go see what was going on and to ask them kindly to leave. It all went downhill from there... she was argumentative, told me to carry all her bags down and that I was treating her poorly.

Well, this finally got to me and I got ahold of my AGM and told her what was happening and she told me to charge her an extra $111 fee as she had nothing set up with us, no mention of a late out anywhere what so ever. Gladly. This is then the review we got:

&#x200B;

"" The heavyset female manager should NOT be a manager. She is rude and her customer service towards Black Americans is the worst!! We were apart of a wedding party and everyone stayed at Hotel Earl. We needed some extra time gathering our belongings because I lost my glasses. The manager comes literally beating on the door and I kid you not shouting “You’re Done! You’re Done!!” When I went downstairs to drop off the key card I asked another lady behind the counter about the shuttle pick up for the wedding party that was listed by the door and that same manager interjected before the girl could answer arguing that we were checking out late. It was 1pm and I just said, nevermind to the shuttle we will drive ourselves. And told them their customer service skills were Horrible!!! Needless to say she quickly charged my card for $111 for a late checkout. I will never and recommend others, especially if you are of color, to never stay at this hotel. The manager made the experience the worst!! Which is very sad! As a person who is a District Manager for a top Fortune 500 Telecommunications company I understand the importance of great customer service and what my fiancé and I I experienced was not that. I was so kind to the employees and got treated poorly. I even tried to look past how we were treated until the end. I realized this woman really has a problem and it’s definitely due to race. Unacceptable! Train your management staff on how to speak to customers that don’t look like them. It’s very clear that the lady was speaking to us in a very embarrassing manner in front of other white customers for a reason. And if this company is anything like the staff they hired I expect there would be no resolution or acknowledgment of my complaint. 

 Do not assume and please try to understand why a person of color hasn’t left the room to check out. If they cannot find their glasses and live over 4 hrs away. They need to find them! 1 hour past check out is not that serious. Train your management staff on how to speak to customers that don’t look like them. It’s very clear that the lady was speaking to us in a very embarrassing manner in front of other white customers for a reason.""

First of all, I don't yell at people. It accomplishes nothing and goes against all the ways you could achieve your goals. Second of all, she was THREE hours past check out with no mention of needing a late check out. Third of all, she was so off base to make this a race issue, I can't stand it. I'm furious for being called a racist. I'm furious that word gets flung around when people don't get their way. The only person that had an issue with race in this whole debacle was her. 

How the fuck do I unstick this from my craw? I feel horrible like I've done something wrong and for this lady to walk away and tell this story and paint me as a racist when it had nothing to do with race and everything to do with you being an asshole. I feel like I have to defend myself against baseless claims. And frankly, I feel like a bad person for no reason.",127,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEF63D60>
712,“Lady” better have my money!,"Greetings, and welcome to the Hotel Room Bureau, not to be confused with the Bureau of Rooms in Hotels.

This office received a short story 2 weeks ago that I shall now share with you all. It is a tale of irony, of woe, and, of course, how much OTAs suck.

We begin our tale at about 5pm. It is I, and my desk partner for the evening Claire, working the slowest night on earth, when the phone rings. 

I answer, and a woman dives into her story about how she has a funeral/illness/roof collapse/what have you and will, unfortunately, have to cancel her reservation. 

“No problem! Let’s see what I can do,” I say, and ask for her name (why do they never tell me their names?). I pull up the reservation, awesome, it’s more than a week out, things are looking good. Then I open the reservation and realize it was booked through an OTA. 

“But that can’t be!” She cries, “I called you to book!” I inform her of the literal impossibility of this, because this reservation was made online through an OTA, and no one at this desk would perform such a dastardly deed. She must have somehow reached an OTA desk - they’re sneaky that way. 

I inform her that I cannot cancel her reservation, she must go through her third party to get it cancelled. She is, understandably, and as most are, upset and surprised by this. She asks me what I expect her to do, she doesn’t have a confirmation email, she didn’t give the person she talked to an email address. 

And at that point, my friends, my brain blue screened. How, I ask you, does she expect me to try and help her, when I don’t work for the OTA, she doesn’t know who she booked through, and she doesn’t have a confirmation email? Her reference number that she wrote from her call doesn’t even match any of the reference numbers I have for her reservation! “Ma’am, all I’ve got is these reference numbers, and that you booked through OTA or one of their subsidiaries, I can’t help you anymore.”

“WHERE’S MY MONEY?” She screams. “I have been charged $XXX.XX for my stay at your hotel. Just give me back my money!!!” I tell her I do not know where her money is, that the 3rd party has it, that we don’t charge in advance unless very specific criteria is met. And I repeat this. Four more times. Until it sinks in and she hangs up on me.

20 minutes later, I see a cancellation notice from the OTA for that woman’s reservation. Guess she had a confirmation email after all.",18,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEF639A0>
713,WHERE'S MY REFUND? REEEEEEEEEE!,"I just spent ten minutes being yelled at by some *redacted* who not only booked by an OTA but also got them to cancel a non-cancellable non-refundable reservation.

Problem is, she didn't get her money back and now I'm the one responsible for it.
How do you not understand when the person at the desk tells you the OTA's got your money and no, I  won't give you back money I never even saw?

First time in my career I had to go outside and seethe for a few minutes. 

The fact that I'm on my eighth straight day at work and I still have until Saturday 22.30 to hang on might just have played a part too.

I picked the wrong week to stop sniffing glue.",112,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEF63B50>
714,No Men Mondays,"Names and things will be changed and this story pertains only to the FD employees and not the HK, Laundry or Maint. teams. 

I know how the title sounds but bare with me.

For backstory: At my hotel we have a very fixed an set schedule (i.e. same thing week after week). There is a strange set up but no women are scheduled to work Saturday after my night shift and men are scheduled to work Monday after that 3rd shift leaves. As I said its strange but it's the way the schedule fell originally and became a running joke with the desk staff. 

Now for this tale I will be telling today these are the characters : Me, Ella (owners wife) , guest and the return of Drew and Rose. On to the story. 

Ella worked 1st shift from 9 am to 5 pm, Rose worked from 3pm to 10pm and I relieved Rose at 10 pm and worked until 7 am Tuesday morning when Drew arrived. This is the same schedule we've had for roughly 3 years give or take a few hours here and there. Never once did any of us receive a call about an early check-in nor did we approve one in person. Well cut to today Rose and I swapped shifts due to a personal issue of hers. I was slightly annoyed but got to work at the time she was scheduled at 12p.m. to hear Drew arguing with a guest. I walk to the second system and sign in and begin my shift. Drew says "" I'll go check the call logs"" and walks off. The guests was very annoyed and glared at me. Mind you I was less than a fourth of the way down my cup of coffee with less than 3 hours of sleep. I thought it best to smile and keep my nose out of it. I excused myself back to my back office desk so I could enjoy my coffee and ""breakfast"". Drew came back visibly annoyed and asked me to handle it since a member of our corporate had come in. I took a long sip of my magic bean juice and a deep breath. 

Me: Hello what seems to be the issue today? 

Guest: I called yesterday and was told I could check in early FOR FREE. 

Me: I'm sorry sir I don't see where anyone approved that yesterday. Do you know about what time you called?

Guest: I called around 3 in the afternoon. That guy in the back was helping me I already told him. Where is he?

Me: Mr. Drew got held up with important tasks that needed to be completed immediately. I am here to assist in any way I can. 

Guest: I'm going to report this place to Ex-tra Price-tonight. They told me I would be able to check in. 

Me: Sir if you called your 3rd party they can't approve early check-ins. 

Guest: No I called this property direct. 

Me: Okay, Do you remember the name of the staff member you spoke with them I can give her a call and see if she forgot to put it in. 

Guest: HE didn't tell me HIS name. All HE said was that HE approved me for free early check-in.

Me: So you're saying you spoke with a man?

Guest: Yes, obviously.

Me: Then you didn't call this property sir. There were no men working the desk yesterday only women. 

Guest: OH YEAH. It was a lady then. 

Me: Sir the earliest check in I can guarantee is X time in a few hours but I can't approve free early check-in. 

Guest leaves in a huff. I went back to the back to read my book and enjoy my coffee. He hasn't been back. I asked Rose earlier tonight since I was still in town and she said he hasn't called, cancelled or shown.",24,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEFB1E20>
715,"""Don't mind my uncle.""","The cast:

Me: A relatively recent night auditor.

Mumbly Mike: My desk partner most nights. A pretty good dude.

Nephew: A punk-rocker in full gear, probably between 35-50.

Uncle: A sad, greasy punk of indeterminate age, underdressed for the weather.

Guests 1-4: Not particularly relevant beyond being in the area.


The setting: a relatively nice, business-oriented hotel. It's a place to sleep, get a hot breakfast, and move on.


So our story begins around midnight. A famous local venue had a show tonight, so we had a few guests dressed for it. Honestly, even coming back in stumbling drunk, none of them were really any trouble. Enter Nephew and Uncle. Nephew is drunk but coherent, and is doing his best to get Uncle back to their room. 
""Don't mind my uncle,"" he says. And I don't. He's a mess, but he's a supervised mess, which is all I really ask for. They go on their merry way up the elevator. 


Come 1AM, a pair of guests are about to head upstairs. 
""Uhh, there's a guy in your elevator... he's breathing."" Well, that's question 1. Of course, this is when guest 3 arrives to check in(haven't run audit, whatever) and guest 4 is checking out our snacks. I assure guests 1 and 2 that we'll get him taken care of, and retrieve Mumbly Mike from the back to assist. We get a look at the guy, and I am completely unsurprised to see Uncle, slumped over on the elevator floor with a crushed cigarette. He must have decided to go for a smoke and passed out on the way. I delegate the drunk wrangling to Mike, because even though I think I could lift this guy, it's better to let him do it. I juggle the other guests– 1 and 2 are rubbernecking, 3 gets checked in and goes back out to his car, and 4 turns out to be a nurse and offers to help. Thanks, but not necessary. 


Mike, meanwhile, has been trying to get a name out of this guy so we can figure out where to send him. We really don't want to send him to the drunk tank when there's someone in the building  who might even be looking for him. Eventually, he remembers the name on the room. Just our luck, there are two rooms under that name. I ready my most sincere apologies for waking them up, and call one. Voicemail. Call the other. Voicemail. Disappointed, but not surprised. Mike heads upstairs to ask in person, leaving Uncle with me on the couch. I'm bracing for the worst.


But then the elevator returns! It's Mike, with Nephew! Nephew seems like he's had to do this before. 
Uncle says something incoherent. 
""No, you're not going to jail,"" Nephew sighs, and hauls him back to bed. 


And that leaves me here. All quiet in the lobby.

716,I messed up… from a guest,"So I am staying in a extended stay smomewood sMilton (name changed to not activate bot lol) I have been staying here pretty much since August, I fly home once a month but other than that I practically live here. Most of my trips home on the weekend I don’t even check out of the room so I have the room I’m just not in it for 2 to 3 days a month LOL it’s just easier -I don’t go down to breakfast because I’m not a breakfast person, I don’t have much interaction with staff because of my schedule but when I do they have been great, like no complaints. I clean my own room as best as I can and ask for service maybe every week to week and a half just to get sheets and the dusting stuff that I don’t have without going out and buying Windex or some thing

Being away from home has been awesome and yet so hard. But more awesome than hard, I think what is the hardest is knowing just how hard it is at home and being able to try to enjoy myself here even though my family is in another state. It’s a great job, like totally amazing, this is getting long I’m sorry.

The housekeepers typically only come if you call and ask them to come, occasionally they will pop in and check if you need anything a couple times a week if I do not have the do not disturb sign up. I was getting ready to run to the store today and I tidied up the room like I always do because I like to be prepared in case someone comes in the room I don’t look like a total slob. …. I left a notepad on my desk that had a few rough drafts of a suicide note that I had written while drinking and not coping with my shoulder pain and being away from home. Sometimes writing it out is my way of getting it out of the system. I’m not technically suicidal

Anyways, the housekeeper came in while I was at the store she made my bed up much more beautifully then my half hazard making and replaced my towels all the good things. But the note… She read it, she had to have it was moved in a different position than when I left it. I’m not upset she read it it was a note on a piece of paper, I’m just embarrassed.

I was half expecting a knock on my door from either the hotel manager to kick me out or the police for a wellness check or something. Nothing has come from it so far. Maybe she didn’t grasp what the note meant? 

I definitely worry that they’re going to want to kick me out because I’m sure they don’t want to suicide in their hotel, I am 98% sure would not do it in the hotel especially after reading all of these post, I don’t know how I would do it but I know I want to do it in a way that will traumatize the least amount of people

So what do you think is going to happen, assuming she read the note, this was about four hours ago that she was in the room and saw it so I imagine if she had actually called somebody they would be here right now… should I approach them about it or just wait and see if it goes away and be more careful about where I leave my stuff out in the open

So embarrassing 🤷🏻‍♀️",34,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEFB1B80>
717,"Well, I hope you choose to stay at a property such as our if you need to hide from someone for your safety... or any other reason.","I just had the most \*pleasant\* lady call the front desk and ask to be transferred to John Doe's room. (His name wasn't in the system BTW... so if he WAS staying here... it was NOT under his name.... RED FLAAAGGG!!!!).

Me: Of course what room is John Doe in?

Lady: Um... I don't know, you tell me?

Me: For security reasons I cannot even tell you if he's at this location, but, if he is...  I would need to know what room John Doe is in.

Lady: Security reasons??  I know he's staying there. He told me he would be staying there. You should be able to look it up. Last name spelled D.O.E!

Me: I understand, however withou----

Her: This is sooo crazy, ANY other hotel would already have me on the line with him. (TBH if he was actually here... under his name.. I MIGHT! MIGHT!!! MIGGGGHTTT! have put her on hold and called the room to see if he was willing to take her call.... but I didn't even have his name in my system.)

Me: I understand how frustrating this may be however, its a liability to jus----

Her: OMMMMGGG!!!! YOU'RE NO F\*\*KN HELP!!! \*hangs up\*

Its possible that Mr. Doe knew Ms. Lady... but if he didn't.. and she was Ms. CRAZY Lady... me even confirming that he was here (which again he wasn't) could set off a chain reaction of things.

I just want to ask the individuals who act like this ""If you're trying to avoid someone would you appreciate the front desk staff being like ""Ahhh yes they are here let me transfer you"". Like some people are crazy and if you even confirm that they are at your location, they will go door to door and find the individual they are looking for.

Also... If you're worried and want to do a welfare check call the police!!!",44,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEFB1AF0>
718,Feisty elderly couple feign ignorance as they try to get me to open our lobby,"Soon after I get on an elderly couple pull up and slowly head inside. The husband (H) rattles our locked lobby door with the strength of a 30-year old lumberjack for about 10 seconds. My GM, who's at her desk, peeks out and jokingly asks who's trying to break down our door. The wife (W) motions her husband over to the night window where I am standing waiting for them.

W: Hi we need a room close to the lobby preferably here (points to parking by the FD which luckily we have available).

Me: Yes I do actually may I please have an ID?

H: What? I can't hear you (as he is producing his ID). Can you open your lobby door so we can do business properly I can't hear you through this thing *knocks on the night window*.

Me: I apologize sir unfortunately due to the pandemic our lobby remains locked. We are currently experiencing a COVID surge in our country as well.

H: I can't hear you, can you hear him?

W: *shrugs* I don't know.

H: How much are your rooms.

Me: 2 Trillion USD

H: What?

W: Can you write it down please?

I write it down and place it in the night window slot.

H: I can't see it! Why can't you just open your lobby I can't hear you at all.

W: They must be scared of us.

H: We're not criminals, we're elderly!

Me: Unfortunately our lobby is currently closed due to health considerations for our guests and employees.

H: Can you believe hotels are like this now? *shakes head* I wonder why they won't let us in the lobby to do business.

But they must know, they're both wearing masks and made copious use of our hand sanitizer. Just a bad day for them I guess. My GM got a good laugh listening to me deal with them.",30,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEFB1130>
719,Why I Quit,"I have read several different stories on this sub, alot of them I can relate to and have held onto what I wanna say for a little while about my 2 years spent working as a front desk employee at a hotel in Canada. And why I quit.

Firstly I really do respect the owners, managment and other team members I worked with. Especially since I started 2019 and then covid hit shortly after. It was a difficult time for hotels as this sub knows all to well. Wild s**t went down at hotels during 2020. 

I worked alone on the afternoon shift mostly but would tend to cover here and there on nights.

It was very weird working through a pandemic and watching my friends start working from home while I still had to show up and basically awnser phones and emails. Ocassionally get yelled at and told different insults because of our covid protocals.

The steps we took as a hotel to ensure saftey were very good, to an extent. Working alone I would often leave the front desk, completely unattended and then go do tasks like general cleaning, fix a tv or two, sanitize door handles, light switchs etc.

By mid 2020 I was starting to see more and more of the dark/sketchy side of hotels. Basically I was seeing ladies of the night very frequently and most were not chill. I was starting to get very uneasy about people who would show up to the hotel and would often hide my personal belongings when leaving the front desk. (Because it was not a secure front desk area)

I brought up on many occasions that the only traffic we were getting was these ladies and countless men arriving and then leaving shortly after. Me and managment often clashed on what is and isnt protocal during a pandemic for a hotel because of this. Beacuse these ladies were paying,  it was not really an issue. 

Our policy was to log people into a ledger getting their firt last name and phone number to be able to see guests. Except we have 2 floors and first floor is patio rooms so people often just went in and out of rooms, plus people would often just write some random name. 

Here is the nitty gritty. 

A guy who had a gun threatened to end my life. And I had no escape. I ended up quitting after.

As explained things were getting progressivly more and more not chill. Guests starting showing back up, the hotels in the area took supsities to house homeless which I did not mind but unitentionally brought more crime to our surrounding area and soon we were getting homeless people in and around our hotel often in the dumpster. Our hotel staff started quiting. The workload increased exponetially. I would be awnsering the phone, emails, checking guests in, guest services, sanitizing, cleaning and what ending up lacking was security. ( I mentioned this many times. Managment claimed they were watching cameras but they used it more to spy on workers.)

One afternoon we had a full hotel, with a bunch of workers arriving who booked over 20 rooms. Checking in guests was a main priority so I was not watching cameras. At this time a man ( we will call him family man) called the front desk. Once I was able to speak with family man he said he had a strange encounter with a man shouting outside his room the night before ( we will call him Joe ), Joe was calling up to a lady in the room above family man.The two men then had an arguement because family mans daughters and pregnant wife were trying to sleep. This particular afternoon family man said joe was back and doing it again. After i had a couple minutes I went out to Joe and talked about what he was doing.

Joe said something like "" this b***h needs to let me into the room, i know its in there. "" he was a sketchy dude. I kindly asked to try to settle this matter a different way at the front desk. He called me different names and then threatened me and said "" If I have to come back here and take whats mine, it wont end well for you."" 

I made note of this but proceeded to deal with the rest of my duties. As this was fairly common for people to say such things during these months of chaos.

After an hour or so Joe came back whilst I was still extremly busy and began shouting again. This time family man came to the front desk and tried his best to be quiet about the situation but in a calm voice and quiet enough not to alarm others he told me Joe had threatened him and that Joe had a gun. I told family man to go back to his room and lock the door, then called the police, my manager and told the other gentlemen in the lobby to go wait in their coworkers rooms / I gave the workers room keys to clear the lobby.

After hanging up Joe charged into the front desk lobby. This was getting way to real, although I did not see the gun I saw his arm at his hip. ( I also trust what family man says because he was a regular whom I often chatted with in the afternoons.) I was trapped because of the way the lobby is setup. There is only a sliding door enterance to the lobby and a door leading to the hallway which is locked and only opens with a key card. To get behind the front desk there is only one flimsy mid waist door with no lock. That was my protection until help arrived.

Joe was screaming and clearly enraged, he tried to open the door but its locked he ghen came around the desk and started to be very vocal about how pissed he was. I tried the "" "" go to method of talking to him normally to see if there is a good way to resolve his issue and buy time, no that was not the case he was even more upset. He demanded I take him to the womens room. I told him I have to watch the front desk and wont be able to leave, just buying time. Again screaming he wanted to go to that room. Unsure of any possible outcomes I looked at cameras and noticed no one in the halls. I thought if I give him a key card but not the card to access her room that could be wise but also what if's about guest saftey since he will now be in the halls. (Looking back this has weighted on me alot because I knew police were enroute but when. I tried to buy as much time as I could. I feel ashamed as I let him into the hotel because I feared for my life.)

Ill never forget what he said to me. He said "" You have 1 minute to open this door or I will do exactly what you think I am going to do."" I slowly gave him a key card with only access to the main door. I ran to the cameras to make sure no one would be in his path. No one was thank god. As he got closer to the womens room the cops arrived in full Swat gear. I gave them a key and told them the room to go to. 

Needless to say Joe was arrested. No one was harmed. He did in fact have a gun.  And after talking with police my manager arrived to try to assist. Guests were super curious and the lobby was beginning to fill. I was in shock and trying to keep it together.

I tried to calmly tell my manager I was leaving and going home when the manager said no. You can not leave. And continued to spout stuff about me and my obligations. I put my stuff in my backpack and started to walk home. Cant remember what I did that night but I am glad I had roomates to help console me.

The next day I showed up to work but they thought I wouldnt so I had the day off. I talked with my manger and the manger cried apolizing for trying to make me stay at work and realized the severity of the situation. I hold no ill will toward the manager but was extremly stressed and took the day to reflect. Over the next week I became extremly irritated at the state at which our hotel accepted this and moved on. 

No course of action for my request to get more staff to assist with security, no new front desk arrangment to have some kind of escape.  Nothing. I put my two week notice in.

After quitting I had a bit of a nest egg of money and was determined to get a job working from home. Months later I found a safe work from home job where I can glady say I am happy.

I have more to say but since I do not wish to dox anyone or the hotel itself I have restrained my frustration. I just really hope they learn from this and similar instances that have happened due to a lack of security and 1 person running a hotel. Alone, at night, and with no escape.",26,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEFB11F0>
720,Isn’t someone going to hand me my keys??!,"Tale from the front door, been doing valet this morning. A guest calls down from their room to request their vehicle. Waiting time is 15mins, car was brought directly to the front door of the hotel in 12mins. After that, its just a matter of waiting near the door

After about 30mins I get another call so I go ahead and grab that one. While I was away, apparently the guest for the first car was sitting in the lobby for the past 40mins. I guess her patience ran out once I appeared to be addressing another task. Asking the FD agent “isn’t someone going to hand me my keys?!” 

I’ve been standing 10 feet from this guest for half an hour without her saying a word. Even if you expected me to remember your face, wouldn’t you find it a little curious that I’m forcing you to wait for no clear reason? 

I guess I missed the morning meeting where we go over every guest’s profile including a picture, hometown, dietary restrictions, temperament.",17,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEFB12E0>
721,I can’t tell I’m just weak or this job is actually terrible,"I hate this fucking job and want to vent. I’ve never hated customer service more in my life and almost all my jobs have been customer service.

The property I work at is very low on staff, so I work alone a lot. I guess that’s fine, except when it’s busy and especially when there’s no manager or anyone on site, which is often. Whenever someone asks to speak to a manager, which is often, it’s hard to get ahold of anyone if it’s one of the MOD or AFOM day off because the GM is barely ever here. We also have about 4 housekeepers when the building needs about 20, so many people don’t get their rooms clean or trash taken out. Guess who has to hear their complaints? And have people pointing at me saying “YOU are going to clean my room today” Um, exqueeze me? No. I will not be cleaning your room. Maybe one of the 4 housekeepers MIGHT get to your room today, if we don’t have too many rooms that we need to make available first. So many bad reviews saying the hotel is dirty, some people’s room was still dirty when they first entered it. A lot of people complain about the dust, trash or things like a hair tie left on the floor upon receiving the room.

I was also barely trained before I had to work alone. I was hired with no prior experience. We did maybe one or two days of training and then working mid-shift the rest of the week to shadow someone and offer support to the morning and evening shift. I had no idea what I was doing, I’m pretty sure I gave a few people free rooms because I didn’t know what I was doing and it made me so fucking angry that I was brand new to this job and they put me at the front desk alone. It just seems like a recipe for destroying your business, letting some new person who knows nothing, run the desk alone. It’s literally like pulling someone off the street and having them run your front desk with no experience. When I work with someone else, it’s either another person who started at the same time as me or the new AFOM who was just recently onboarded because we had no front desk manager before. 

There’s so many bad reviews about how dirty this hotel is, apparently there’s trash littering the hallways because no one knows what to do with their trash. Good luck finding the hotel on Google though if you want to leave a review. It isn’t listed, the only place to leave a review is on the online travel agency website. The business not being listed confuses so many customers. They are often afraid they just made a reservation with a non-existent hotel.

I hate every question anyone asks me. I knowI have to get used to it because that’s the job and I have to learn about all the different requests as I go along.

I’m so tired of giving people directions. I just work here, I lived in this city most of my life and still have issues navigating it, I live in another part of town so I don’t know this area. This is the tourist area and probably the last place in the city that I’d ever go to on my own. I do not know how to get to all these fucking bullshit tourist attractions and shit people want to go to. Just use Google maps, fuck. I can’t believe how many people I have to Google directions for. I have people asking me if I can book them tickets to a show. No I fucking can’t, I don’t even know wtf you’re talking about or why you can’t just call the theater and figure out this information yourself. 

I’m so tired of apologizing for how fucked up and dirty the hotel people are paying sometimes $500 a night for. There are big name famous luxury hotels for that price, I imagine with lots of staff and smoother operations. My GM got mad at me the other day because he happened to be present in the lobby, finally, and someone called wanting to speak with a manager and I told them I’ll get him, without gauging what they wanted first. Hmmm *maaybe* they have a complaint about the myriad common issues people have with the property that you’re supposed to be overseeing. You know wtf they want, talk to your fucking customers please so they can stop talking to me as if I have any way to solve their problems.

Somebody was complaining daily that they wanted to speak to the manager about the horrible experience they were having and he wasn’t in for their entire stay. Except the last day, he was talking to someone in the lobby. She came down exasperated looking for a manager again. I was happy to tell her he’s finally here. He was talking to someone else and I directed her over to him. He pulled me aside after and told me not to do that. Wtf?! So you’re right here after days of not coming to work and this lady who was having a nightmare experience STILL can’t talk to you. Dude...

I wanted to work here for at least a year to get experience and possibly get promoted or work in a different hotel but I’m not sure if I’m cut out for this industry. I feel miserable every day at this job and I don’t know how long I’ll last or if it will get any easier for me.",24,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEFB13D0>
722,"A pet incident, on a non-pet friendly property..","This series of events occurred yesterday..

A little bit of information, I'm on the management team for a historic boutique inn in a touristy historic city. We are not pet friendly, and are priced high usually due to our location/demand in the city.

A guest calls one of my front desk members from their cell phone stating that they let their dog out of their room this morning to stretch it's legs. The guest proceeds to tell us that his dog apparently entered another guest's room which was left open and destroyed a large amount of their belongings..

The gentleman then tells us that his dog consumed something it shouldn't have in their room and is now needing medical attention, now asking us for financial compensation for his room as well as the animal's vet bill.

This came to a surprise as we asked the gentleman why he had a dog on the property in the first place, he stated it's not his ""pet"" and that it's a ""rescue"".. We tell him that we will not have any financial responsibility over the situation and as a matter of fact he will be responsible for the other guest's damaged belongings as well as a cleaning fee for having an animal on the property in the first place (we have rugs in all of our rooms).

The man then loses his absolute marbles and starts threatening to call the police and telling us that he's a lawyer and is going to sue us and report us, etc etc. 

The odd part of the situation is that we can't .. find the guest on our property. We watched 24 hours prior of surveillance and cannot locate a pet on the property at all. I also touched base with our Housekeeping, Laundry, Bellman, and Front Desk staff to keep their eyes out for an animal and not one person saw a thing suspicious yesterday. When calling back the number he initially called on there is no voicemail or answer. It was very peculiar. 

We also never received a call from whomever's belongings were damaged/eaten in the first place.",20,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEFB1490>
723,"I'm SO confused. Was this a ""free room"" attempt?","I'm not actually sure what just happened. My mind jumps to 'she was trying to get a free room' but I don't even think that was it. I'm so confused. Very short phone conversation:

Me: [answer phone greeting]

Her: Hey, I was wondering if it was possible to book a room for my friend but use my card? Like as a surprise

Me: Yeah, of course! There are two ways, either you can book online using her name for the reservation and pre-pay, or the easier way would be booking normally through us with her name and your card info, but we'd need what's called a Credit Card Authorization Form. Basically I e-mail you a form, you sign it and send it back to us stating we have permission to use your credit card for this reservation without your physical presence.

Her: Would that charge me like, *today?*

Me: Oh, no, it otherwise works completely normally and will only place a hold on your card upon check-in and charge it upon check-out.

Her: ...Oh. Uh- so I'd have to like, pay for it?

Me: *(immediately thoroughly confused)* Um, yeah? I'm sorry, I must have misunderstood you. You wanted to make a reservation for your friend, for her to check into, but use your card so you pay for it as a surprise? Like a gift to her?

Her: Yeah, that's what I wanted

Me: I'm... not sure what your question is?

Her: It would charge *my* card? I would have to pay for the room?

Me: Yeah, but not right this second. Later on, whenever the check-out time is.

Her: Oh. *(Disappointed)* Okay, thank you. *(Click)*

I'M SO CONFUSED. Can someone tell me what I missed?? Did she WANT to pay now? I gave her the option that involves pre-paying for the reservation. I'm stumped.",27,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEFB1430>
724,"""You F'd up my reservation!"" Ummm, no, you did.","So, I was enjoying a slow and quiet Sunday night (12/12) when a guy walks in just a little after 1130pm....

Me: Good evening. Welcome to \[hotel\]. How can I help you tonight?

Him: I need to check in.

Me: Sure. What's your last name.

Him: Douchebag

Me (types in name): Are you sure your reservation was for tonight Mr. Douchebag? I do see a reservation under your name, but it was for last night, the 11th.

Him: Yes I'm sure. I called your hotel directly.

Me: Hmmm, I don't think you did Mr. Douchebag. I see you made the reservation thru Liceline. You would have had to do that online or over the phone.

Him: Right. I called them and they transferred me to your hotel.

Me (trying not to roll my eyes): No, that's not how they operate.

Him: Well, then you guys F'd up my reservation when you received it.

Me (looking at reservation history}: No sir, no changes were made on our end to your reservation. Perhaps you gave them the wrong date when making the reservation? (Yeah, wrong thing to say. I realize that now)

Him (getting quite upset): No, you people F'd up my reservation! I know what date I told them. Since I'm here, just f'ing fix it so I can get checked in!

Me: I'm sorry Mr. Douchebag, since the reservation was for last night and you didn't show up, it went into our no-show account when the night audit was run at 300am.

Him: Of course I didn't show up; the reservation was for tonight!

Me: Well, Mr. Douchebag, we had no way of knowing that, so if you want to stay here tonight, I'd be happy to check you in with a new reservation.

Him: Just use the old one.

Me; I'm sorry, I can't do that.

Him: Why the F not, it's f'ing paid for.

Me: Yes sir, it is prepaid. But since it was prepaid thru Liceline, I'm not allowed to make any changes to those types of reservations. Besides, a no-show fee was applied to the deposit, so there's a zero balance on the reservation. Another reason I wouldn't be able to use it.

Him: This is f'ing ridiculous.

Me, not really knowing what else to say, just stood there looking at him.

Him: So you're not going to help me?

Me: As I said, I can check you in under a new reservation (I quote him the rate), but beyond that, there's really nothing else I can do.

Him: G\*ddammit! Let me go see what my wife wants to do.

He goes out to his car, which is parked right by our front door. I watch him on our monitors get in and the car sat there for about five minutes before pulling out of our parking lot. From the direction he turned, he may have been heading to the hotels behind us. Maybe the wife thought the rate I quoted Mr. Douchebag ($143.99+tax) was too much.

Thankfully, my Sunday night returned to being quiet, slow and uneventful after that. LOL :\~)",134,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEFB1370>
725,Is it just me who thinks this is unacceptable for a Front Office manager to do this?!,"This happened when I was working as a Guest Relations Officer at a 5* hotel somewhere in South East Asia. The Front Office manager gathered everyone to the back office to have our Handover meeting. The FOM always had a tough attitude and a military way of managing her staff members so a lot of people were literally afraid of her.

One day, we had a Food &amp; Beverage event going on because it was a special day of the year which the F&amp;B event would last for a week. On day 1 of the event, we noticed there were very little guests attending the lunch and dinner event even though the hotel had been promoting the event for about a month. So during our front office hand over, the FOM started of with explaining how terrible we have been doing and humiliating the staff members in front of others as always.

When everyone were scared, quiet and not daring to look her in the eyes, she started to quiz people about the details from the F&amp;B event. Note that there were no emails sent to us ever about what food and drinks they were serving at that event. This info should only be known by the F&B staff.  So as most of us failed the answers, she ordered us to take out our phones. 

On our phones, she ordered us to follow the hotel’s Instagram page and to share the event’s post to our story and to repost it on our Instagram page and tag the hotel in the description. Basically she was taking advantage of her power as a scary manager who everyone had no respect for but would rather tolerate her instead of being jobless, so they all did what she ordered. 

She then looked at me with an angry expression because I didn’t take out my phone. She repeated her order louder than before just to see if I hadn’t misheard it. I just said:

“How much will we receive in payment for marketing the hotel’s F&amp;B event on our private Instagram?”

Everyone looked at me with a look of Oh-No-She-Didn’t kinda look. A colleague looked relieved that someone spoke up. I had always been the type who would not take on anyone’s bull crap if I consider it to be a form of abuse. I explained how this is considered as free marketing and it is unfair that the hotel is asking for their staff to market the hotel’s event on our private Instagram page. 

The FO manager looked at me with the most irritated face I have ever seen.

We argued a bit in front of the other colleagues during that handover and her only defense to her argument was that as our punishment for not knowing the answers to her questions.

In the end she just gave up because my points were stronger as I knew my rights. Plus the hotel prefers not to fire their staff because they would have to pay them for like a month or two.  

None of my colleagues backed me up, everyone just stayed silent and followed her orders and we all went back to our jobs once the FO manager dismissed us. She made my job a living hell from then onwards for talking back at her. She did do other things that I thought was unacceptable too, this story was just one of the things she did. 

I eventually talked to the Human Resources Manager about all of her wrong doings. The HRM just said I can rant and complain with him whenever I disagree with her way of managing the FO team but he will not make any official complaint reports about her. I eventually resigned after a few months of working at that hotel. Even the Finance Manager thanked me on my last day for the times I had stood up for myself because even she being the Finance Manager, was afraid of the her. The FO manager is still working at that hotel and the front office staff turnover rate is still high with people not tolerating her for more than 6 months.",47,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEFB1550>
726,"""I have a VoUcHeR"" & 'Reports that don't matter'","This is a tale but also an excuse to rant a little bit at the tail-end.   


Hello my lovely Auditors! (And later, Front Desk. Good morning.) It's been a week or two since my last post, and boy howdy it's gotten great!   


As stated in my last post, I'm no longer split between two hotels (Working for the same company mind you, and only making part time at both) and have succeeded the role of Full-time Auditor at the newly built Mampton Bin! (Still the same company.)   
So, my beautiful people, this literally just happened earlier, and let me tell you- in the last two weeks we've had roaming hordes of Homeless, much like the zombie apocalypse.   


So, we start with me, having clocked in around 30 minutes ago, plinking into the computer and reading some reviews (Which I'll get to later) when I see a woman, rotund with badly maintained makeup step into our breezeway and to the door. I, eager to get my last check in ask if they have a reservation, which they confirm- but before I can confirm their name, I accidently open the door!   
Yaaaaaaaay....  
Story time!  
Voucher Lady - VL  
Me - ME  
\[Insert Pep\] ""Good evening, how can I help you?""  
VL: ""Hi, I'd like to make a reservation.""  
Me: \*Instantly deflated\* ""I'm sorry ma'am we're not taking reservations at this time""  
VL: ""Oh no, you see- I stayed here when you guys first opened up, and let's just say there were a few ""Little"" (She air qouted) problems, and your manager gave me a voucher for a free night.""   
Me: \*Drops all form of mask, and speaks in the most monotone, 'I'll beat your ass' voice, real quiet.\* ""Ma'am we don't do that here.""  
VL: ""Oh no, you see your man-""  
Me: ""Ma'am.. We either refund your current stay or take a portion of your bill off.""  
VL: ""Well this was when you just ope-""  
Me: ""When did we open ma'am?"" \*I stare quietly, intently. Already knowing the woman has no idea\*  
VL: ""Uhhh.. oh gosh.. uhm, sometime.. last year?"" (She stumbled way more than this.)  
Me: ""Ma'am we opened this year, what was the name of the manager.""  
 (It's on the wall right next to me.)  
VL: ""Well, I have the voucher, it has all the information!""  
Me: ""Ma'am what was the name of the manager.""  
VL: ""I have all the information!""  
Me: \*Done making this woman panic at this point that I'm going to assault her\*   
""Please leave the building.""  
VL: \*Some sounds of protest\* (I don't remember)  
Me, Again- More forcefully. ""Please. Leave. The Building.""  
VL: Fine, but I have a voucher, what's your name!""  
Me: ""Street-Blacksmith467 ma'am""  
VL: ""Well \[Enter username here\] ""Your customer service was awful, and I'll be talking to your manager!""  
Me: ""Not if you can't name him ma'am, go try at some Hourly hotel.""  
VL: Scoff and leaves the building, muttering a stream of curses.

Now that the tale is done.   
I nightly go through our reports, and one here..   
"" The room next to us was extremely noisy until the early morning and we got almost no sleep ""

This is one of them, firstly- I worked the entire week this guest was here, never- not once did I recieve a phone call of a noise complaint. IF YOU DON'T CALL. WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING. It's a general rule that unless there's a reason to, don't go to the guest floors.

I miss the little things that I expected of Mampton before Covid  
I miss the cookies in the evening and the USA Today.

727,A guest’s perspective: Overbearing manager vs new trainee,"Today I was having my lunch at a hotel at a certain mountain resort in Malaysia. Because it’s over 5,000 ft above sea level, making transport and cargo super difficult, all food, even Five Guys and McDonalds are priced at Three to Five Star hotel meal prices. It’s also about 15C colder than the rest of the country so heating is required for most fast foods. So I decided to eat at a hotel instead. 

Anyway, it’s a mid-range, four star hotel, and one of the few not owned by the big cooperation that owns everything in this mountain, so you’d expect there to be great service. 

This lady, who I assume to be the owner or majority shareholder, let’s call her “OWN”, enters the restaurant with the general manager, identified by his nametag, and they sit down.

From their conversation in Cantonese, a language which most of her staff do not understand, I, with my broken Cantonese picked up that the Chef was new and he had to replace the old one, and they were testing this new one.

Basically, the whole time they kept calling him to complain about their food, asking him to make changes constantly and when the waitress informed the manager that the other table (me) had been waiting an hour for my order of pasta and soup, OWN demanded the chef to come and ask him why he took so long to cook my simple order.

The general manager told her to tone it down because they had been calling him non stop but in turn she threatened to fire him.

I’m just gonna assume the last chef quit, because of her.",8,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEFB1670>
728,"""That's not an emergency.""","I'm frustrated because this is currently ongoing.

Some of you guys may already know me, I post about my hotel a lot, and already we have another tale to share.

About an hour ago, I had two very kind guests come up to me and inform me that there was a dog barking in a locked car down in the garage. This is noteworthy for two reasons;

1. We don't allow pets, there should be no animals on site short of service animals.
2. It is currently 43 degrees outside. Yes, my parking garage is warmer than that, but it's still not a heated garage.

I called animal control to find that they'd already closed. I go down to the garage to see the situation for myself, and it's a damn chihuahua. It would be one thing if this was a winter dog, but this poor little thing is a lap dog, it can't keep itself warm for the entire night.

I call my city's non-emergency line and put myself through to non-emergency dispatch. I explain to her what's happening and she sort of gets this ""ugh, one of *these* calls"" type tone with me, like I'm a Karen for caring about a dog in a cold car.

Dispatch: ""Listen, it would be one thing if the car was outside, or stolen, or if the dog had been there for hours.. how long has the dog been there?""

Me: ""I'm not sure, I was only notified of it about ten minutes ago. The parking ticket on the dash is missing, so I have no idea who belongs to this car. I have no idea how long this dog has been in there, but it's small, and my parking garage isn't heated.""

D: ""So you don't know if it's just been a few minutes, and the owner could be coming right back?""

M: ""I don't, but I also don't know if it's been a few hours, and this dog is barking it's head off. Do we run the plate to see who owns the car, I'm not sure how to help the animal, that's why I called you.""

D: ""Okay, but you don't know the situation. The owner could be coming right back, and that's not an emergency.""

M: ""That would be why I called non-emergency.""

D: ""Yeah, but that's not an emergency, we wouldn't come out for that, it's just a dog.""

After that, I straight up hung up on this bitch.

Look, I don't much care for chihuahua's myself, but that doesn't mean I think it's okay to sit in a 48 degree parking garage all night.

If anyone has ANY ideas, I'd love to hear them. The dog is still down there, and it's currently been an hour.

&#x200B;

UPDATE: Sorry for the late update, there was a dumpsterload of additional shit that went down that night and I *ran* to get out of there at the end of the shift.

The folks that told me about the dog came down and asked about an hour later about any updates, and I informed them of what I went through with dispatch, and I was out of ideas, other than maybe them calling about it, too, and doubling down. They agreed, and called. This time, I'm not sure if he got somebody nicer, or if it just worked, but he told me dispatch told him cops would stop by eventually.

About an hour after that, police showed up while I was dealing with another dog on site that the owners were trying to claim it was a service dog right as it squatted and took a piss on the lobby floor. They ran upstairs at the sight of the police (They were the dumpster load), and the officers ran the plate for me. The owner wasn't a registered guest, and the Police went downstairs to inspect. Between that time, and them moving their patrol car down to the garage, the car and dog vacated from the garage, and there was no longer an issue.

In total, the dog sat a minimum of 4 hours barking in the garage in a cold car.",78,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEFB15B0>
729,sometimes i really hate people,"i just had a guest who's been staying here for a few days and will be here for a while come up to the desk to ask where our bathrooms are. i told him, and when he came back, he proceeded to talk to me. he kept calling me cutie. yuck. 


he asks my name which i hesitantly gave him. he then says ""oh that's a pretty name for a pretty girl"". ugh, gross one liner. i say, with a straight face, ""thanks"". not seeming to get the hint, he asks if i have facebook. i lie and tell him i don't use social media, so then he asks me for my number. 

at this point i'm uncomfortable and it's obvious. i tell him that he's a guest and that it would be inappropriate for me to give him my number thinking he'd go away. but alas, he just laughs and makes a joke like ""i basically live here now so i'm not a guest.""  

after about a minute or two he says ""well it was nice talking to you cutie"" and you gotta think about giving me your number."" i don't respond and he walks away. 

at first it wasn't a big deal but when it became obvious that i was uncomfortable the advancements should have stopped.",132,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEFB1730>
730,Stressful times,"Ok I’ve been having a long ass month so far. It all started when Thanksgiving hit. I work swing shift and It was a fairly busy night. Around 7pm I was literally running up and down the stairs fixing tv’s when an elderly couple came to check in. I ask for ID and CC since we do a $100 deposit at our hotel (I know it’s kind of a lot but people are always messing up the rooms, damaging linen, smoking, etc.) So the woman starts getting dramatic saying we’re stealing money from them, her husband says he oughta jump the counter and knock my ass out. Before I can even tell them I’m not checking them in they start arguing and leave the hotel. Guy comes back an hour later completely different and friendly, oblivious to what he told me. Ended up checking him in since I was trying to be nice but I left notes if they give any trouble we are to kick them out. They gave no trouble afterward.

Next two weeks have been nothing but slow days and busy nights and constant locals making prepaid reservations only to come check in with no deposit. And it’s always the same shit. “iT dOeSn’T sAy YoU rEQuIrE a DePoSiT” “we weren’t told you needed one” “I’ve stayed before and I’ve never had to give a deposit” “they don’t ask for a deposit at your other location halfway across the country”

Last Sunday same thing but even dumber. One girl came in with 2 males. I recognized the name of the Guest because I actually cancelled her reservation the night before on Saturday. So she made another for Sunday and tried to check in. When I ask for deposit they start calling up people to send them money to cover the incidentals since none of them had money save for one male who had $60 on a CC but we require $100. She pays cash I check them in but I don’t give them keys since I’m waiting for the deposit. They walk outside not even 20 secs pass and I see the girl with both of her hands on one of the males and she’s clutching his shirt like when a bully intimidates a victim. She starts throwing punches the guy tries to get away and got in the car with the other male. Girl hangs onto the car while it drives off and she lets go sticking the landing like some cat. I get her money ready and tell her she’s not welcome here because I’m not making my guests or night auditor deal with that shit tonight. Car with the two males comes back around 1 min later, the girl is outside asking one of my guests that was coming to check in if she can borrow their phone because the 2 males supposedly took her phone. The dude said yea but that’s when the 2 males came back and proceed to start arguing again with the girl and even got disrespectful to the guy who was going to lend the girl his phone . I call security but by then the guys left and girl is sitting outside on the bench. Security comes and asks her to leave and that was that.

AND then just this weekend another damn curveball. I was off for 4 nights came back to work Friday. Overall it was ok. Still had people complain about the deposit but the shift went smooth. Saturday comes and damn it sucked. I checked in a nice lady on Friday, one of my more pleasant interactions. Saturday comes tho and basically what ended happening is her husband passed away in the room. Family walks in and 10 mins later the wife calls and says he’s unresponsive and not breathing. Medics come and try to revive him but when they come down they say he didn’t make it. It was such a trip to see that. Tragic no doubt and seeing their family pour in very emotional and as in much shock as me was heartbreaking man. Family left by 7 and one member who was in another city came late and I spoke to them for about 30 mins about what had happened. It was just sad man. And then to top it off I had to kick two homeless people off the property who were hanging out by the side entrance with 2 shopping carts and all their shit on the floor. I will also mention that this homeless girl had the audacity to ask me if her and her friend can hang out in the stairwell to which I responded no. Afterward she went to the side with her male friend and then proceeded to grab a bucket went to a corner and went to the bathroom right in front of the security camera. Told her to pls leave, she stared screaming at me so I called security and he kicked them off the property.

This past Saturday was too much. Past few weeks have been too much. As far as I go I’m good but shit man, strangers really don’t care if they bring other people down to their level of stress and immaturity. I know it’s more than that. It’s life, it’s choices, it’s just the way shit goes sometimes when having this kind of job. I just needed to vent a bit cuz it’s just been a messed up couple of weeks. 

If you read til the end thank you. I’d really love to read any stories y’all might have had that amped up your stress levels the past month or so. Just so I don’t feel like the only one going thru this crazy ass time.",23,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEFB17F0>
731,"""The room is prepaid, so I don't have to front a deposit, right?""","*(Usual disclaimer: All proprety and personnel names changed. Also for the newcomers: I don't say the exact names of hotel booking service sites since they will trigger the automod.)*

**Flashback to somewhere around spring of this year.**

So enter our guest, Chad Shitflake, who comes in for a check-in one late night. Except instead of parking his car in the check-in space or any open regular space, he has the gall to park in the entrance bay, potentially blocking off anyone trying to pull into the driveway. I kindly ask him to please move his car but he refuses, saying ""it's midnight, nobody's gonna come in."" I tell him that it does happen that we get people trying to roll their cars into the parking lot at midnight, but he only gives enough of a damn to pull his car up halfway into the check-in space.

Then, I go into my usual spiel of asking for an ID and a cred or deb card, as we place a $50 deposit hold on their card that gets released after they check out, assuming they don't damage anything (which the deposit is meant to account for if they do). Like any self-respecting traveler who makes prepaid bookings on online travel agency (OTA for us front desk veterans) sites like Explodia, Liesline, or HotsinglesTonight, he says ""but the room's already paid for."" I explain that I understand he paid for room and tax but we still need the deposit to check him in. He shuts up and presents his card. I continued with the check-in process and nothing seems to be out of the ordinary. 

...at least until he calls back about two hours later to complain that the room is too noisy. I had checked him into the room adjacent to the front desk because it was the last one available for him, and his complaint was that he could hear the front desk phone ring through the wall; said phone is next to the wall separating the front desk from this room. Now we've had hundreds of guests stay in this room since I first started working here three years prior, none of which have ever complained about the sound of the front desk phone ringing, so I'm a little doubtful about the legitimacy of his complaint. But nonetheless just to give him the benefit of the doubt, maybe he has hearing that's more sensitive than normal, I issue a partial refund.

**End flashback.**

It's now December, the month of holiday shopping crunch culture, and I notice that there's a prepaid Explodia res for Mr. Shitflake again tonight. I'm not getting a good feeling.

So Chad parks his shitty truck in the car bay again, I decide not to argue with him about it because he's about as empathetic as a mass murderer honestly. 

> **Me:** ID and card please, there's a $50 deposit that gets released after you check out.
>
> **Chad:** tHe RoOm's AlReaDy pAiD fOr.
>
> **Me:** I acknowledge that, but we still need a deposit. 
>
> **Chad:** What's the deposit even for?
>
> **Me:** ~~In case your poorly-raised and macho ass breaks shit~~ When you check out, housekeeping cleans the room and makes sure everything in the room is okay, then we return the deposit in 3-4 business days.

He continues the check-in process and then complains that last time he stayed here, he didn't like the room, so he asks for a different room this time. Well we didn't get any request from him through Explodia's special request system or phone calls for ""Please no Room 101"" and there's only one vacant room left, but he should consider himself lucky (as do I, because I was not going to deal with the same song and dance about front desk phone thing), because the last room left was on the top floor, some distance from the FD.

I'd chalk up him invoking the ""but I already paid"" card to him forgetting since it has been 8 months since he last stayed, but if he remembers enough about his last stay to complain about his room being noisy due to our phone going off after hours, then how the fuck did he forget about the $50 deposit that he complained about last time, that he thinks he's exempt from because he prepaid for his room? Unless he was just trying to fish for a deposit-free stay.

Anyways thank you for calling the Wangan Inn, no we not fish guests. How may I help you today?",41,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEFB18B0>
732,"Long ago, in a land far, far away . . .","For those of us who've worked the old grand dames of the hospitality industry, a lovely little ""things could have gone so wrong, but went so right"" and yes, bit of bragging. 

Back in college I worked the night audit at a lovely, insanely large historic inn. And by historic, older than the US. And by large, we had a huge sprawling main building AND took up multiple blocks in a very small town with about a dozen small houses, a renovated Firehouse (this will come up later in the story), small businesses (deli, stationary store, etc) and so forth. There's a lovely, VERY long folksong popular at Thanksgiving you may recognize about our little town, you mighta heard it, but I digress . . . 

About 9pm, I was sitting down to dinner with a purloined beer since the Inn hadn't yet realized they weren't locking up the bar taps when a tired, but polite middle aged couple came to the front desk with their luggage and explained that someone had walked into their room while they were sleeping. Turns out our Inn had the same key (lovely old brass ones, not secure at ALL!) for every room in yonder historic house across the road. Which I verified by yanking the keys out of the cubby boxes for that house behind me. \*grrr\* 

After fulsome and repeated apologies, I assured them we would absolutely make it right. Turns out he was a Vice President of <insert tv network here>  Okay, they get ALL THE THINGS. Innkeeper can either thank me tomorrow or fire me. Don't care. It's Beer Thirty and I have audit to do. 

The highest level property on site was the Firehouse - $500 a night. And it was open for the entirety of his reserved stay. BINGO! Great. Called up Security Guard and had them golf cart the couple and their luggage to firehouse, called up waiter who owed me a favor and sent him over with champagne, chocolate covered strawberries, cookies, etc. Set them up with free room service breakfast upgraded their dinner service and basically EVERYTHING I could offer them and apologized AGAIN!

Couple went off into the good night with security guard and zippy little golf cart. 

Shock sets in: cold sweat, shaking hands, what the ever loving hell? No one noticed the same damn KEY opens all the rooms in that house?? FIVE UNITS IN THERE, WTF? I've only worked here two months, AHHH! And the VP of a major tv network. WHY? WHY? WHY? 

Beer. Thank God for beer. Security guards come back in - grousing and griping occurs. More beer. And lovins on security GSD Jack, who I bribed with french fries. That dog loved me. 

What went down after that:

Got a lovely call from the couple - they loved the Firehouse, champagne was great touch. Jacuzzi tub - chef kiss! They reserved Firehouse for wedding anniversary later that year! Woot-woot! Go me! Audit rarely gets big reservations! Tidy little bonus for that! 

Innkeeper comes in next morning, a tad early because <network> is on site. I explain the fubar, show him the keys being all the same and that I closed the empty rooms down and put in an order for maintenance to change all the locks that day. Innkeeper was frozen in horror, anything could have happened with that security nightmare. ANYTHING. Inn was on a rural highway, kinda spooky at night assuredly, very few sheriffs with a huge territory and yeah, ""8x10 glossy photos with circles and arrows"" is running through my head and what could have happened, but didn't. 

Innkeeper: ""Whose room was it?""

Me: ""Well, that's the thing"" and proceed to explain above. And unapologetically explained EVERYTHING I did for them and that the Inn would be doing for them after I left for the day. Note: I had ZERO authority to do pretty much any of that. But needs must. 

Innkeeper: ""I've got your back! Thank you!""

Turns out, lovely VP and wife left a lovely thank you note about the Firehouse, me, the security guard and our security guard dog, Jack. We did our Inn proud. 

I still shudder to think how many decades that damn house was rented out (5 units) with all the same keys. 

I have no idea if the Inn ever upgraded to key cards. But I'm gonna visit them this Spring and see how the old gal is doing. Safe money says they are still using the old historic brass keys.

One day, I'll tell you about the hilarious and completely true story of what happened when the bar caused the fire alarms to go off and the entire main building evacuated during the night, causing every fire truck, volunteer fireman, rescue, etc. in the area to roll on up to the Inn, while I was madly hiding my beer and explaining to terrified and pissed off hotel guests. 

But that's a story for another time.",28,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEFB16D0>
733,I am so embarrassed...,"I have been working at a fairly run-down mid-level hotel for about nine months now and while I have had my fair share of fuck ups and general things not going the way I want them to, I have always prided myself on never losing my temper or crying in front of a guest. That changed today and I am so embarrassed.

Some context before I begin. On Friday night the cable went out, I did the general troubleshooting things I usually do every time the cable goes out and none of it is working. It is at this point one of our long-term stay guests comes to the front desk. Now I've had pretty solid experiences with this guest before, she has been here for about a year now and hasn't really caused any issues (until now that is). Let's call her LG. LG lets me know that it is out and I let her know that I am aware and getting ready to call the cable company. She starts telling me about how \[coworker\] does this and that to fix it and why don't I try those things. I let her know that I already have and they aren't working. I call our cable company and get told that they are escalating the problem and I should be receiving a call within the next four hours. It is 8:30 PM at this point and I say ok. LG comes to the front desk and asks for an update, I let her know what is going on and she gets kind of angry at me but lets it go quickly and I excuse this behavior. I leave at 11, having not heard from the cable company, thinking that it should be fixed by the time I come in the next morning. 

I come in Saturday morning at 7 AM and the cable still is not fixed. The night auditor tells me that she called the cable company again after never receiving a callback and they said that someone should be coming to the property to fix it. Ok, that's great! I call them and try and get a time estimate, they tell me between 9 and 11 AM, not great but I'll take it. LG comes to the front desk around 7:30 asking for an update, again I let her know what the current plan is. She spends the next 7 minutes at the front desk expressing her ""frustration"" at the situation at me. Now I'm a big girl, I've been yelled at before and this is nothing new, I can take it. I express how much I would also like the cable to be fixed and that I am working hard to resolve the issue. She eventually leaves and I continue my day while still fielding other complaints about the cable like a champ.

Around 10:30 LG comes back asking if they've come yet. At this point, no one has come and I haven't heard anything. I don't know why she even asked this as she can see into the first-floor laundry room where the cable box lives. I tell her no, the cable guy hasn't shown up yet and I will be calling in the next 15 minutes asking where he is. She gets angry at me again, and again I take it without blinking an eye. I call the cable company and they tell me we are in their system as ASAP so whenever the next technician is available he will be here. I wait and about 25 minutes later a tech shows up. I'm thinking this is great, everything will be fixed by the time my shift is over. The tech lets me know that he has to replace the cable box and that it shouldn't take him more than an hour. In the meantime, the owner of the hotel who is also the GM shows up. I let him know what is going on and how LG is VERY unhappy about it. I must have summoned her or something because she chooses then to come and yell at me some more. My GM then gets her anger directed towards him and he tells her that we are going to comp two nights for her. This seems to satisfy her enough to leave me alone at least while he is here, while it makes me slightly angry because I think that's just reinforcing her behavior. Then the tech takes a little while longer than expected, he ends up being done around 1:30 and lets me know that we are just waiting for the cable company to get the new box activated which should only take an hour at most and if it isn't working by 2:30 to give him a call. LG comes down and I let her know the news. She is grumpy about the hour-long wait but is generally happy that it should be fixed. 20 minutes later the tech comes back and says there are a few things he has to do. He then sets up camp in our lobby and is making phone calls. He seems a bit stressed but I leave my shift thinking things will get fixed before I have to come back in on Sunday morning.

That whole afternoon I get texts about LG yelling at \[coworker\] because the cable still isn't fixed. He also lets me know that the tech had to leave saying that there is an issue on the back end and that they would fix it in the morning. I am unhappy about this and spend the rest of my afternoon preparing for getting yelled at more. 

Sunday morning (this morning) I come in and get regaled with stories about how LG laid into everyone yesterday. I call the cable company again to get an update and am told no one will be out until Tuesday morning to fix the issue. I fight against this and get us in for Monday morning. I hang up feeling unhappy still but satisfied with my progress when LG comes for an update.  I guess this morning she was especially angry because she just started going at it. This is a whole other level of yelling than I have experienced before, like she is making personal jabs at me and telling me how terrible I am at my job and how I am too busy doing my school work instead of doing my job (I am a full-time student and often do homework when it is slow, but my quarter ended last week and she knows this). This is day 3 of being yelled at by this woman and I am over it, I defend myself and tell her that I have been working as hard as I can to get it fixed. At one point I tell her that I am just as upset as her that the cable is out and she has the audacity to ask me why. I reply that I am very tired of being yelled at and she decides this is time to double down on me about how I'm doing my job improperly. It is at this point I start crying because of the vitriol she is spitting at me. I walk away to try and salvage my dignity and take a few minutes composing myself in the back. 15 minutes later she comes back and attempts to apologize to me, saying things like ""I'm not mad at you"", ""I didn't mean to make you cry"", and ""I'm not going to take responsibility for your tears"". At this point I was so emotionally shut down by these past three days I just nod and tell her I'd done the best that I can. She then goes on to complain about me telling the kids on the first floor to be quiet because they are just kids and should be allowed to have fun. She walks away and I go eat a snack to try and convince myself not to quit on the spot. 

I'm so incredibly embarrassed at the way that I lost it in front of a guest, I usually have a better handle on my emotions while at work. 

Tl;dr The cable went out on Friday night and a guest has been so vile over this issue that I ended up crying in front of her",33,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEFB14F0>
734,A Guest I Checked-in Shot Himself,"I don't post on Reddit but this is such a bizarre experience I just feel like I need to share it with somebody.

I've been working night audit at this small historic hotel on university campus for like 6 months. 3 years of night audit experience. On my last shift of the week (friday), I get a 3rd party reservation at like 4 or 5 AM. I remember being annoyed because it was after EOD and I had to jump through hoops to get the system to allow check in (our system is wonky). Guy comes in, real nice, well spoken. Thanks me for getting him in this late at night. We talk a bit while I'm making his keys and reg card. In the middle of our conversation he just nonchalantly mentions that he has a year left to live and he was in town visiting his daughter, who is attending the university. It got awkward because I didn't know how to respond to that. I thought he was either lying or crazy, because he said it so casually. As if he was telling me about his lunch. After an hour he comes back down and asks me where to get breakfast. I tell him some places but explain they prob won't be open for another hour. He thanks me and tips me $10.

So that was friday night. It's my day off today. Less than an hour ago I get a call from my manager asking about this guest. She asks if he was acting odd. I told her that he said he was gonna die in a year, and she let out a gasp. She said he shot himself this morning. Then she handed the phone to a police officer and I told him my entire interaction with him. He said an officer would get a statement from me on my next shift (monday night).

So yeah...I just feel strange and I can't place it. I feel guilty for being annoyed at him. I was polite to him but inside I just wanted him to go to his room so I could finish my duties. This is by far the craziest thing that was happened to me in my hotel experience. And I'm nervous about talking to police. I've never had to give a statement in my life. What the fuck...this is just crazy.",91,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEFB1790>

736,Nobody Told Me I Swear!,"Wow, day 9 at a new, small, slow property and I've already got a shortie for y'all! Also, if you're standing next to the popsicles right now C M or T, hi.

So we've had a guest the past few nights, when I checked him in he just breathed this air of.... entitlement. No issues, but you could feel it. Apparently last night our audit team had to stop by his room 4 times due to noise, with security finally kicking them out on visit 5 at 5 am. This was in our passdown between me (FDA), audit, and the houseman so the houseman knew the room was vacant. Wellllllll... about 30 minutes into the shift the houseman radios me that this room is in fact NOT vacant and he walked in on the guest sleeping, he's not terribly comfortable kicking him out, ""they leave later anyway"", but nah, not me. After auditing for 3.5 years this is my bread and butter, the moments I live for, so I just asked him to watch the desk so I could talk to the guest.

The guest answers the door SUPER groggy and wearing what I can only be described as a cross between a tunic and a mumu, so I will be calling him Tumu.

Tumu: Hey, how can I help you?

Me: Hi, the overnight staff reported to me that they had asked you to leave at 5am, I really need you to leave now.

Tumu: Nobody told me, they just told me to keep the music down.

Me: I have documentation reporting 5 visits to your room, the final one being at 5 am where we asked you to vacate or we would contact the police. At this point you are trespassing, so you can either pack up your things and leave, or I will actually call the police this time.

Tumu: Nobody said they wanted me to leave last night, just that we were loud!

Me: That is not what I have reported and I need you to leave.

Tumu: Fine, I'll be out in a couple of hours I just need to pack, don't call the police.

Me: I'll give you ten minutes before I call for assistance. You were asked to leave a couple and a half hours ago already and you are trespassing.

It took him about 20 to get out, but he is officially gone, we have triple checked his lock-out this time, and I already profusely apologized to their neighbors (the justified 4x complainers) and told them management will follow up by the end of the day in regards to compensation. Security TOOK A PICTURE of them getting into their Uber at 5 am, audit locked them out, I genuinely have no idea how they managed to get back in unless they accidentally made a copy instead of a new key.

737,Brother burns down a set of rooms.,"Its been a bit since I last posted about the motel i helped my parents run..
My parents when i was a junior in high school bought one of the two motels in our little town in eastern Washington.

it was old but provided a steady income for us. well two of the rooms where made out of a old single wide trailer. it was of no matter people always booked them for stays.

problem was the furniture was from the sixties and was very very flammable.  My brother used to go over and watch sports on the tvs and smoke cigarettes in the rooms.

well one of these occasions he fell asleep with a lit cigarette in his hand. and what do you know that couch he was asleep on caught a hot cherry from his cig and poof that couch caught flame. 

Dear brother woke up in time to get out of the room but alas that trailer was toast in twenty minutes flat.

Mom and dad had insurance on the property and the sad part is that they paid me and my brothers to demo it vs paying a actual construction company. lol 😂😂

my brothers and i made about a grand apiece. And mom and dad put a park model trailer there which turned into our biggest money draw during the peak season.",6,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEFB1160>
738,So sick of the hobos...,"...just begging to be tased.

Dear friends, let me tell you, it has been a couple of nights.  My long held hatred of humanity - you're hotel workers, and in many cases, even better, fellow auditors, so I don't mean you - has reached new heights.  But on the other hand, the police finally managed to catch and remove one, so, my view that they're all useless has slightly diminished.

Anyway, let me tell you of three encounters.  Names have been changed where applicable.

**Last night, the first of the nights**

My very first encounter is as a man with a fast food bag comes up to our front door about 30 seconds after some folks checked out and left(this will be relevant later).  His clothing is a little worse for wear, but not quite hobo-chic.  Tries to come in the locked front door.  This man, we shall call Justan Burger.  For his name was Justin(or at least, it was for the purposes of this tale).  I press the button on our speaker.  I, as always, will be NA.

NA: Hello, sir.  How can I assist you?

Justan: My sister is making a reservation for me online.  Should come through in a minute.

NA: Unfortunately, we are sold out, and have no rooms available, so no such reservation will be forthcoming.

*This, dear readers, is where things go from zero to Hobo-Karen at an alarming rate.*

Justan:  Don't lie to me.  I just saw two people leave.  You have their room available.

NA, Internally:  What the actual fuck did he just say?

NA: Unfortunately, we do not have housekeeping staff available overnight to turn around a room, so that does mean I'm not able to rent that room.

Justan: I don't care.  I just need a room.  It doesn't need to be clean.

NA, Internally: Okay, I'm officially done with this idiot.

NA: Yeah, that's not gonna happen.  As you're not a guest here, you need to go.  Now.  Do not further darken my doorstep this evening.

Yes, I literally said that.  Told you.  No fucks left.  I even hear that song in my head.  At this point, he's cursing at me over the speaker, I hold the talk button so I can't hear exactly what he says.  He finally starts to leave, and then I see someone walking down the hall.  From my seat at the desk, I can see most of the way down the hall, but not the stairwell or the door at the end.  The man walking down the hall will henceforth be known as Cowboy, in reference to the color and symbol on his ballcap.

Cowboy:  What time is it?

NA: It's 4:15.

Cowboy: Oh.  My watch must be off.  I was supposed to meet my brother down here at 5:30.  When does your breakfast open?

NA: The restaurant opens at 7.

Cowboy:  Oh.  Where's the nearest gas station that's open?

NA: About a mile or so that way.  <Pointing>

So far, moderately pleasant, and I still had no hints that he's not a guest.  But he seems a little twitchy.  Says he's gonna go out to smoke and decide if he wants to walk all the way to the station.  I warn him about Justan, tell him that if he sees him, to let me know so I can call the cops.  He seems nervous.  Don't blame him.  Suggest that he instead maybe should smoke out on our patio.  It's a non-smoking area, but it's super early, no one's out there to tell on us.  He steps out, comes back and decides it's too cold to smoke.

Cowboy: I really should go back to sleep, but I'm an insomniac.  Have PTSD from being in the army.

NA: That sucks, man.

Cowboy:  Maybe I should see if my brother's awake.  He said we were gonna leave early.

The conversation that follows is a bit long and unnecessary, so I'm just gonna sum up.  He asks to call his brother's room from our phone, which is absolutely fine.  I just need the name and room number.  He doesn't have the room number.  Okay, you know what, I can waive that requirement as long as he has the name.  He's standing right here, and it's not like I'll tell him the room number.  I'll dial it.

But then he starts waffling.

Cowboy: Sorry, his wife's parents booked our rooms, and I'm not sure what their names are.

NA: Then I can't connect you.  You'll just have to wait til he comes down.  If you want to give me his name, I can let him know you were down here if he comes down.  Though... if her parents booked both rooms, I can look up yours and look for another room with the same name?

Cowboy: Sorry, I don't remember my room number.

He proceeds to give me an explanation of where his room is, and it could only be one of two rooms based on that.  At this point, urge to tase, rising.  But he's been nice, if a little off, this whole time, so I do genuinely wish to help him.  So I check both...and nope.  There's no way either of those are his reservation.  I know one of the two guests, so that's not it.  The other has been here a while.  Tell him that unfortunately neither of the rooms it could be are his wife's room, but I have an idea.

NA: Let me check your room key.  That'll tell me your room number.  Then I can work from there.

...and it's 3 weeks old.  What the actual fuck?

NA: Sir, this is an expired key.  <I sigh> I have one more idea.  Let me look up the name on this room for that night and see if that same name is in house.  <Spoiler: It wasn't.>

As I start debating what to do, several guests come out of the elevator and enter the lobby.  Cowboy steps aside to let me help them.  As I help the first, one of them ventures too close to the door, and it opens.  From the corner of my eye, what do I see?

It was Justan.  Trying to get in.  I apologize to the guest in front of me.

NA: Sir!  I told you already you couldn't come in.  What the hell do you think you're doing?

Justan: I was just throwing away my trash!  What do you want me to throw it outside?

NA: What I want is you off my property.  But yes, you can throw it outside, in the TRASH CAN RIGHT OVER THERE, SIR.

Justan: My name isn't ""Sir"", it's ""Justin"".

NA: If you take one more step into this hotel, you can tell your name to the cops.  Now LEAVE and get off the premises.  Immediately.

Justan flips me off and leaves.  One of the guests in line grumbles.

Guest 2: Hey, is there coffee available?

NA, internally: Lady.  For fuck's sake.  DO YOU NOT SEE ME DEALING WITH NOT ONE BUT PROBABLY TWO HOMELESS PEOPLE HERE?  One of whom has been belligerent?  No, there's no fucking coffee!  I can't leave the desk for your safety and the safety of the guests on site.   No, but let me leave the desk and let someone probably get stabbed so you can have your fix.

NA: I'm sorry, but unfortunately our restaurant staff turned off the machine to do a cleaning and forgot to turn it back on.  I turned it on half an hour ago, but it'll be another half hour before the water's hot enough to brew coffee.

She rolls her eyes at me.  You know what, fuck you too, Karen.

Cowboy: Oh, there's no coffee?  I'll go over to IHOP and get a coffee.

NA, defeated:  Sounds like a plan, sir.

He fucks off, I finish assisting guests.  Call cops over Justan, and if they happen to run across Cowboy, to see if they can verify if he's not a guest.  I just want them gone.  And Justan tased.  And our doors to not open to expired keys.  Yeah, I verified it still opened them.  Let management know.

Cops arrive to late to find anyone.  As usual.

**Night the second.  Tonight.**

This one's a bit shorter.  Gentleman comes in from our patio.  We have a locked gate on the patio, but the doors out to it don't lock.  Which has always irked me.

He heads straight to the restroom.  Looks vaguely familiar.  Immediately I suspect that it might be someone who jumped our wall.  But it could be a guest.  I decide to just watch the bathroom and see what happens.  It could be Bearskin, after all.  Different clothes, so I couldn't be certain.  Also, I suck at recognizing faces.

45 minutes later, he has not left the bathroom.  I, desperately hoping he's gone in there and ODed and died, decide to give it 10 more minutes, then take a quick, non confrontational pee break.

Still in there.  I pee, make no contact otherwise.  Come out.  Call the cops.  They arrive quickly, confirm he's not a guest and escort him out.

I write a message to management about the incident and how, once more, I'd really like a way to lock those patio doors.

Oh well, this is the last night of my week and my parents are treating me to some BBQ in the morning in early celebration of my impending birthday(they won't be here Christmas week, so will miss my B-day as well).  So I have that to look forward to.

739,Night audit craziness,"So I was doing night audit tonight and it was a relatively boring night. Had to go up to one room twice to tell them to turn it down because we were getting noise complaints but they did quite down when I told them if they didn't I would have to remove them from the hotel. That was about midnight so 3 hours later I get done with the audit part of night audit and get a call at the desk saying there was water pouring from the ceiling. So I ran up there and yes there was water coming from the ceiling. I would say dripping but it was a rather large water mark from the floor above.

So ran up to the floor above and it was the room that I had to tell to quite down. I bang on the door to wake them up and no answer for a minute of me banging so I use the master key to unlock the door and they had the door latch on. So I tried banging with the door open and shouting in the room to no avail and I didn't want to risk wasting time to grab the door latch tool so took the advice of my head of maintenance when this sort of situation is happening and body checked the door till the screws on the latch gave out

I got greet by a naked man understandably wondering wtf is the front desk guy busting his door down from. I explained the situation and said I need to check the whirlpool in the room because the room below them is flooding and yup the guest also had his wife with him and they were getting things on in the whirlpool while it was filling up and flooding the room so bad it was going into the floor below them....


So what was a boring night turned exciting real quick


P.S for those that want to know. I relocated the guest from the floor below to a different room and discounted it heavily along with gave them extra points. For the guest who flood their room. Charged them an extra 150 dollar cleaning fee for what maintenance is going to have to take care of. I would have kicked them out of the hotel as well but they had a 2 year old boy with them and while I can be cold-hearted when I need to be. I am not heartless. I let them stay the rest of the night the understanding they need to be gone by 8am when housekeeping and maintenance show up",2,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEFB1A00>
740,"Lord help me... crazy lady threatened my job, but I'm 99.123789% sure she called the wrong hotel.","Our office is closed overnight, but me and my boyfriend live on-site and we have a phone for after hours check ins. My boyfriend normally handles this as there are drunks and tweakers at night, but as he was in the shower I answered the phone. This woman calls saying she wanted to know if so-n-so checked in, that her wife checked in under \*insert name of the woman on the phone name\* and her (not sure which woman's phone, her or the wife) battery was low. I asked if she had a room number and she of course didn't. I informed her that I can't give out any information regarding guests without a room number as well and that she should call her wife. She says she will call \*insert Indian name\* and wake him up, I explain that there is no employee or manager here by that name, and perhaps she has called the wrong hotel. She asks for my name in a very bitchy tone, so I repeat it, and spell it for her, cause I know where she is going with this. She proceeds to say ""I hope you liked your job"", of course implying I'm going to be fired.

Yes, my GM is Indian, and so is the owner, but their names aren't even close to the on she provided. My general manager thinks of me and my boyfriend as family, and I know my job is safe. But it still makes me shake with anger that this bitch is threatening to get someone fired for simply following a policy to keep people safe. I will put up with a lot of shit, but DO. NOT. THREATEN. ME.  

ETA: Oh, and of course... I checked our in house and arrivals. 3 people, all male. No reservations with that woman's name at all. ",28,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEFB1970>
741,Don’t Leave Your “Service Dog” Behind!!,"I checked in this couple claims to be a “returning guest” at my hotel. I don’t know whoever made this reservation but they gave her a big discounted rate. She probably bullshit it to get this rate. 

Anyways, When I was checking her in, the first thing she asks was to give her a room with good view, higher floors and stuffs like that. I gave her a good room too since shes a “returned guest” written in the comment of the folio. I immediately notice that she brought along her dog “Pit-bull” btw. Before I could say that we are going to charge her for the one time pet fee and have her sign the form, she was like:

Stupid Girl (SG)
SG -“Oh, I have my dog with me and he’s a service dog”
Me -“Oh great! May I ask what he is trained to do?”
SG - “Well, hes trained to do a lot of things, use the toilet, not to bark, sit around, and protect me” 
Me - “ Mam, that doesn’t qualified…”
SG - “ You cannot question any more about my service dog, that’s illegal” 

Since I did  not know much about ADA law, so I just let her be on her way, which is so stupid of me.

And guess what, they left that “service dog” alone in the room unattended and went somewhere. Fuck who knows where they went. As expected, the dog started barking and barking wouldn’t calm down. At this point I tried to contact her but no luck. I went ahead and charge her for the pet fee and inconvenience fee.

Why would you leave your service dog behind if you need it for your service?? She doesn’t look like she has any disabilities and just bull shit her way in. Smh

Thank you for reading guys! Hope y’all have a wonderful night!",110,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEFB1850>
742,Suspicions confirmed about guest when they check-out ...,"This is a little wordy-apologies.

A guest checked in 4 days ago and registered herself and 3 kids. The new hire had the wisdom to put her in a room without anyone below her (room below her is OOO) to avoid a potential noise complaint. The next day we got a call from a local school asking if one of the children's mother was ""living"" here because the bus driver needed to know where to drop off her kid.

My GM confirmed that she was and the bus showed up and the driver asked me to call the mothers room as she couldn't just leave the kid here. I called the room and no answer so I head up to the room and the mother answers thankfully. I also notice another woman in the room but I'm not going to give a fuss about the unregistered lady could be a sister. She gets her kid and heads to her room.

The next day I noticed 2 bikes outside her door--red flag. Around here that usually means drugs are involved. So I playback the camera and at least 5 different men are in the room including a known DNR person. I call her room and tell her the unregistered people need to leave and if they don't we will have the unregistered people evicted. I checked the cameras and they all left. I call my GM and inform her of whats happening and she tells me to come in early at 12pm because she has something she needs to do.

The next day I get there a little before 12pm and over the radio housekeeping says the lady isn't leaving their room. I head up there and tell the lady and the DNR guy they need to leave its well after check-out time and we need to clean the room. The lady tells me they can't find a ride and they have a lot of stuff. I tell them we can hold their stuff until their ride arrives but they must exit the room now. I could have insisted they leave immediately considering the DNR guy but I felt sorry for the 3 kids.

They haul their stuff down which was more than I expected. I then head to the laundry room because I'm doing double duty (a housekeeper called in). As I'm leaving the office I notice the mom and the kids walking down the street so I figure they're headed to a relatives. I go back and forth and an hour later I ask how much longer before their ride gets here and the guy tells me soon. I tell him we can't hold their stuff much longer its nearly 3pm check-in time etc. 

No ones there by 3pm so I tell him I'm sorry but he needs to leave our property with all their stuff. So he hauls it off somewhere off our property so I figure that's the end of that. I'm running between the office and laundry doing what I can and we're behind because we're short staffed today. Sometime after housekeeping radios me and says there is meth and meth pipes in the Ladys room. OK insta-DNR.  So I update her info and head back to laundry.

Around 5pm when its getting dark I notice the DNR guy heading toward the office. I enter the lobby and see they've moved all their stuff in there and the Lady has turned our coffee service table into her office and she's busily typing on her laptop. I tell them politely that they must be off our property completely within 5 minutes or I will call PD. The Lady sarcastically says ""but we did leave"". I said all your ~~crap~~ stuff is in our lobby so you in fact did not leave. 

She then acted like she was tearing up and said she had no where to go with her kids their ride is on the way. I told her we found meth and meth pipes in her room and her tears evaporated. She asked what was she supposed to do. I told her that's not my/our responsibility and I'm sorry shes in this situation but they needed to leave now. They start moving their stuff to the curb so I head back to laundry and I get a frantic call from housekeeping to come to the Ladys room. Its the last room on their list and they're finishing up cleaning it.

I get there and someone had kicked in the adjoining room door and got access to the other room and used that as well. The busted into room was disgusting: trash filled with diapers, some weird black substance on the beds, clogged toilet, and a very odd chemical smell. I called the police and went to check if they were still on the curb and they weren't. We filed a report gave them all their info and the cops left. 

I feel bad for the kids I really do I didn't want to just kick them out but they also made me more mad than sorry. I knew something was up when I saw those bikes. Every time we have issues with drugs and guests there's always someone on one of those bikes. 

This property is awful: not the staff or management its the owners. They won't allow us to take deposits EVEN with cash payments because they think it will lower business. The Lady paid in cash daily which itself is a red flag so now we're out whatever the cost of repairing the door is. I guess they don't mind that along with all the other stuff we get from drunk/junkie/homeless rooms like busted furnishings, urine soaked beds, feces on bed/linens/floor/walls, broken furniture, smashed mirrors, busted TV's, broken windows, all of which I have personally seen during my time here.

I am so glad I'm leaving this disaster property soon. If they would only charge a deposit that would solve instantly over half of these trouble rooms.",28,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEFB1220>
743,Shiny members can kiss my shiny metal ass!,"Obligatory Bender reference, because I’m feeling pretty grumpy right now.

Note: my pronouns are they/them, but I unfortunately let myself get misgendered just because it’s a little easier in conservative Shmisconsin. Not preferable, but what can you do?

CAST:

Mr. Super Shiny = SS; Mrs. Super Shiny = SSW; Me, the disgruntled receptionist = Me

Mr. Super Shiny walks in with his wife just as I’m bringing a fresh pot of hot water out. I set it down and make my way back to the desk.

Me: Hi, how are yo-

SS, gruffly interrupting: Checking in.

Me: … Sure, what’s the last name?

SS: Mr. Super Shiny— the one and only guest who truly matters at this godforsaken establishment, king of kings, lording over simpletons like you.

Maybe he didn’t say all the extra bits, but his tone *clearly* bled it. Now, I have four reservations left for the night, both of them connecting rooms under the same name, so I know he’s not in the system. I look to see if maybe he digitally checked in, but he wasn’t In House, either.

Me: Could it be under a different name, by chance?

SS: Um, *no*, it’s under my Shiny Status, I just told you that.

Me: Unfortunately, I don’t have your name in our arrivals tonight. Do you have an email I can look at for you, or a confirmation number?

SS: Why would I have an email? Ugh, here’s the confirmation number.

He rattles off number so fast I barely catch it, but thankfully I was able to avoid his wrath with my excellent WPM score. He did indeed have a reservation… But it was for the 26th of November.

Me: So it looks like here that the reservation was booked for the 26th of last month.

SS: You’ve gotta be kidding me! No, I did *not* book it for the 26th. That’s the day I booked it, but I clearly booked it for today.

Me: If you’d like, I can help you find the email—

SS, pointing at me: You better hold on a second, *ma’am*. I’m gonna find it and show you *exactly* when I booked it.

You know what, old man? *Fine*. I fall completely silent and let him do his thing, and, wouldn’t you know it, he doesn’t know a damn thing about searching through his iPhone. When he opens the email, he gets prompted to join the Wi-Fi, but being stubborn about asking for my help clicks ‘use without internet’, so when he tries to load stuff it doesn’t work for him since, duh, he’s not actually *using* the internet. Of course, he can’t find the email, so he figures he’ll just book a new reservation under the Shmilton app. When he opens it, it’s not letting him book.

SSW: Maybe you should—

SS: The Wi-Fi isn’t loading anything!

Me, holding back a laugh: Here, do you mind me checking real quick? You just clicked a wrong option.

He begrudgingly hands me the phone, where I log in to the Wi-Fi.

SSW: Oh, so you just needed the password?

SS: Oh, she had it all along.

I wordlessly slide his phone back over to him. He then attempts to book another room, but as I watch him, I notice he doesn’t click the ‘search with points’ option, so he’s just looking at the prices.

SS: I’m not paying anything for this room, why’s it showing me the rates?

I asked for his phone again, and clicked backwards, speaking in my most deadpan, uninterested voice when I underline it and say, “Here. ‘Book with points’.”

SS, slightly taken back: Well, I saw the option down there, I didn’t know I needed to click it.

Mhm. Sure. So when I offered my help the first time, I could’ve helped you figure it out, but you wanted to take the long route and hey, I have an empty lobby and all night, so I was so glad to watch you struggle. Once he finally books the room (after complaining the needed points went up) he rattles off the confirmation number again, and I am able to check him in with my polite— but sharp— speech. Surprisingly, they both thanked me, though his very nice wife came down a couple minutes later complaining the room smelled like smoke, so I changed their rooms and am crossing my fingers they won’t give me any more trouble the rest of my shift. I didn’t tell him that he probably lost the points from his prior reservation since it counted as a no show, but I'm willing to let him figure that out on his own.

I just don’t understand the entitlement of Shiny and Super Shiny members. “Do you know how much time I spend at Shmiltons?” Do you know how much time *I* spend HERE, listening to guests far, *far* richer than I am bitch at me, a minimum wage worker, because your stupid ass couldn’t book the right date and missed your actual reservation? You think I work here because I *like* it? You don’t think I’d rather be anywhere else, where I don’t have to call guests out for their *very* fake “”service dogs”” while I’m training my own and know the laws, or where I don’t get berated because you for some reason still believe you can check in without a credit/debit card or an ID?

I’m good at my job. I *know* I’m good at my job. But Geez Louise, some of these people almost make me snap. I think all of us front desk-ers deserve one day where we get to say anything we want for 24 hours. A hotel version of The Purge.

It’s a good thing I need to pay rent, am I right?",17,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEFB1310>
744,Last night I had people call it Bull**it that I couldn't check them in while shepherding guests into our storm shelters then today found out 50-70 people were killed by the tornados in Kentucky from the very same storm.,"My phone alerted me that I was under a Tornado Warning and I confirmed online that there was a tornado on the ground somewhere near me right as the tornado sirens began to go off and guests were getting the same alerts on their cell phones. I was the only person on duty and had to open different storm shelter areas and shepherd people from different buildings into them, during this two different guests showed up to try and check in (with a raging storm and tornado sirens blaring in the distance) and both were upset when I said I could not check them in until I got the all clear and urged them to join everyone else in the storm shelter. One guest told me ""this is bullshit"" and he sped out of the parking lot. He came  back over an hour later and complained that no one at McDonald's would help him either (they did he just had to wait) because they took shelter in their walk in freezer. 

Luckily the tornado touched down outside of town and I don't believe anyone was hurt but today I read there are between 50-70 people thought to have been killed by tornados from the same storm in Kentucky and it made me mad all over again.",210,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEFB1280>
745,My brief return to Front Desk made me leave hotels completely,"Hey folks! Been awhile since I posted but back to share more stories. This one is very recent. I'll share my last post because it has a link to another story.

[My last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheFrontDesk/comments/l789ay/when_karen_morphed_into_a_toddler/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)


So during covid, I found myself sort of missing being at the front desk. (Spoiler alert, big mistake... If the title wasn't obvious enough) My buddy tells me about his boutique hotel that's looking for an AFOM. I was explained to help guide the guest services manager that had 0 management experience.  Unfortunately, I reported to a manager that was not okay with a subordinate that not only had more experience than her, but also didn't need the job. (I opened an insurance office with my buddy. The income from that was larger than my crappy hotel salary).


This small boutique luxury hotel with less than 100 rooms, had ADR well above $1200. As we all know, with higher rates comes higher expectations. I had the front office staff on point (pretty much the rooms division was on top of their game.) I became the complaint department that would put out fires in other areas, especially the restaurant. 

So what happened?

My boss has been in and out due to being sick and I was wrapping up a 4 1/2 weeks run of working consecutive days 14+ hrs as the right hand of the GM. So 3 days prior to my days off we had an influencer and journalist invited by our marketing team check-in the hotel. Obviously she was a VIP so I handled her arrival, orientation to the property and finally and introduction with the GM. In normal routine, I don't leave until the VIPs that are dining in our restaurant are settled in. Our restaurant on an average evening would do 80-90 covers, this evening they were doing about 60... So I went home. I got an email (work emails on my phone) our PR alerted us to this VIP posting on her IG story complaining about the service, food quality, and timing of the meals. I called the front desk, told my ace of an agent to go find the VIP, tell her I was made aware of the situation and ensure that they are not charged for dinner and that I would follow up with them in the morning. (My personal philosophy, if the hotel screwed up, we are to give the guests the world.) Our surveys are a big deal to the GM, I have a complete empowerment to do what I feel is right for the guests. Recovery was so successful, she took down her story and posted a shout out to me and my team about our professionalism and all that jazz. 

While this was going on, we had a future guest that just so happens to follow her. He emails us with a screenshot of the story and tells us to cancel his reservation because we don't know what we are doing and cleary not ready to open yet. Now this guy, I was familiar with. He was constantly trying to cancel his reservation (we take a non-refundable deposit equivalent to half of the total room & tax) The rich elite folks don't like hearing no and want their way, I as a compromise will offer to keep it as a credit and they can call for a later date. So I kindly remind the gentleman that he would be losing his deposit, was he sure that he wanted to cancel. Of course, he begins calling and harassing my staff trying to get a refund. I put out an email to the team, central reservations, and copied the GM and corporate telling everyone not to refund the deposit. On my Friday, he started going off on the concierge over the phone. A normally firm colleague was starting to get rattled and verbally abused. I grab the phone in the back office and literally the GM, my front desk, and the director of F&B tell this guy he's not getting a damn penny. He starts threatening that he'll go to corporate and get me fired where I laugh at him ""Sir, we at (insert hotel name) don't negotiate with terrorists"" Everyone in the back office starts cracking up and he gets pissed. Asks what'll corporate think of my customer service. I tell him to take the L, he already sent an email cancelling based on somebody's post on social media and that doesn't warrant a refund. I go into my only day off, confident because I have corporate and the GM backing me up.

GM had my boss come into work, just so I can have a day of rest. On my return, I don't have a recap from my boss so I have no clue how the day went. We were hosting a wedding so because I was involved in the event, I didn't follow up on the email. Day goes by without a hitch, as the GM is getting ready to leave; he casually tells me that the guy got his refund deposited. He confesses that he told the team to keep quiet about it. Silently, I go through the phone log and see his number on our received call and it lasted 26 seconds... It took my boss 26 seconds to cave and refund 3.5k. I walk off the shift telling the GM that I expect corrective action to take place.

 There was already tension and issues between us and this was the straw that broke the camel's back. What I didn't see coming was that I would sit in the HR office with the GM, my boss, and director of HR about my attitude and insubordination. I turn to the GM and ask him point blank ""so you're siding with her?"" I get the speech about how there are no sides. I remind the GM that the last 3 months, my boss has put in less hours than I had that week. ""So you are going to pick a side..."" He refused to verbally back any of us so I tell him that he made his decision. I turn to director of HR and say ""Consider this my resignation. I understand that I do not get to file for unemployment. Once I walk out that door, that's it."" Still getting the political responses, I get up and walk out. I send an email on my phone to the GM and HR that I was resigning effective immediately. 

I was once an agent and I hated when the managers would immediately cave and make exceptions for guests when we would get in trouble for making that call. I swore I would never do that to my team and I absolutely refuse to deal with that level of disrespect.",20,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEFB1AC0>
746,i hate guests who basically live at our hotel.,"so there's a guest staying with us right now (he's been here since at least july) and normally, he's not a bad guest. he doesn't bother us too much and doesn't cause problems with other guests. however, there have been instances where he has gotten absolutely livid with us over things so small. 

not long after he first checked in (maybe a month or so?) he came down to the desk and asked why his room hadn't been cleaned when he specifically asked for service the day before. i know that he asked for service because i was the one he told and he watched me write it down. 

when i apologized and told him the housekeepers must have missed it and i can send someone up, he LOST IT. he started screaming at me saying how this was the worst hotel he'd ever stayed in and he was sick and tired of not having his room cleaned. he was cursing up a storm at me by the way, which at that point I stop listening. I am an adult that WILL be treated with respect so the minute a guest begins to scream at me, I ignore them. he then proceeded to say that if his room wasn't cleaned by the time he got back from the store two minutes away, he was going to go all over the internet and say what a shitty hotel this was. again, i ignored him and watched him walk out. 

there were no more housekeepers, so unfortunately i had to ask our poor bellman to do his best to clean his room. he did what he could and i told him that the guest would have to just deal with it. when the guest came back in, he walked right by me without so much as an apology. 

another instance, was just a few weeks ago. 

it was a saturday night, and we had an event going on in our ballroom. it was packed and they were pretty loud. staff asked them several times to quiet down and they did, but it seemed like it just got louder and louder.  the event was scheduled to go until 11pm. we got lots of complaints about this noise, which was understandable. and most people were nice about it. 

but this guest was not. he came down the other check in desk we have and screamed at our night manager for fifteen minutes about the noise. saying very rude and obscene things. my manager very politely told hom not to speak to her that way three times and he just kept on so finally my manager lost her temper which she rarely does. 

she told him to stop screaming at her or she would call the cops and have him removed. this apparently shut him up and he left, instead deciding to come over to the desk i was at and scream at my coworker and i. same deal. he wouldn't stop screaming at us and finally we told him that he needed to get out of our faces, stop screaming at us, or we would have the cops remove him. again, this shut him up and he went to his room. he called us an hour later to complain again, but we just ignored him. 

then i heard he came down to the desk in the morning and screamed at the first shift person who wasn't even here during second shift.

of course, he didn't get in any kind of trouble and we were told by our managers that there was nothing they could do. im sick of being screamed at by people and nothing happens to them. especially if theyre staying on company's dime.",23,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEFB1BE0>
747,Want to throw a childish tantrum in front of us? We'll gladly show you the door!,"This took place about two months ago at the casino resort I work at. Around the beginning of my shift (around 11:30 AM), I check someone in whose room is not ready yet. Whenever a guest's room is not ready at the time of check in, we let them give the nightly incidental hold, direct them to the bell desk to store any luggage away, and offer some entertainment/dining options while they wait. One such option the property just implemented over the past summer was a wristband that grants access to the pool deck while you wait.


This particular guest opted for the pool wristbands for each member of his group. I then let him know that even though there's no exact estimate as to when a room would be ready, I'd send a rush out to housekeeping for him. After he left for the pool, I thought I wouldn't hear from him again, until...



Around 3:15 PM, the guest (who we'll call Bathing Suit, or BS) storms down to the desk in nothing but blue swim trunks, smelling of alcohol, and drooling all over the desk. Not to mention he was absolutely irate!


BS: MY ROOM ISN'T READY! You said you put a rush on it for me, but you're a fuckin' liar!


OP: I'm sorry you feel that way sir. I can check on the status of the room for you; could I please see your photo ID?


BS: No, FUCK YOU! YOU'RE A FUCKIN' LIAR!



At this point, the agent at the terminal next to mine, along with a supervisor, decide to step in and have me step back.



Coworker and Supervisor: STOP YELLING! CALM DOWN!


BS: NO, I WON'T CALM DOWN! I WANT MY ROOM AND YOU WON'T GIVE IT TO ME!


Supervisor: Can I see your ID please?


BS: NO, I JUST WANT MY ROOM!


Supervisor: I understand, sir, but for me to check on your room, I need to see your ID.


BS (to me): You're a fuckin' liar.


OP: I'm sorry you feel that way sir.



BS finally hands over his ID, and we see that his room has been ready since 1 PM (one of our agents even attemped to call him). We let him know of the good news, program his keys, and send him on his way to the bell desk. On his way over there, BS slips on the tile floor, and a whole posse of security guards follow him over, as they must have caught wind of his temper tantrum. 


When one of the guards talked with us about what they should do, we collectively let him know that BS is no longer welcome here. Right after I was sent on my lunch break, security had removed BS from the property.


When I came back from lunch, the supervisors on duty praised me for how I handled the situation. I then realized that since BS was on a cooking-dot-com reservation, we could report the guest for misconduct on the cooking extranet.",26,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CDD4ACA0>
748,The Good Doctor,"Hi! First post but ever since I came across this sub I've been dying to post my story of my absolute worst guest/customer I have ever had in my life. We here at my hotel call her The Good Doctor as a running joke.

She's a surgeon who works for the cancer centre and travels to multiple cities for her job. No doubt it's stressful, I'll give her that. She stays in our chain of hotels around 300 days out of the year, making her an elite member with special privileges like checking in and out whenever she wants and allowing her huge discounts on the rooms. If she checks in and shows up out of the blue, we have to accommodate, even if it means sending another guest elsewhere after they checked in if we're at full capacity.

This basically makes her untouchable. She's have to burn a hotel down to have any sort of reprimand, even the President of the hotel in our country wouldn't do anything against her and would fire anyone who she complained to him about, putting us in a very awkward situation. We can't ban her, we can't refuse her anything. It's worth mentioning that The Good Doctor is a vile, nasty person who screams obscenities and insults over nothing.

I manage the lounge in the hotel, very near the front desk. Every morning she calls me first. When I first started, she had to tell me her order two days in a row. Horrific, I know. When I asked the first time, she huffed and asked if 'that stupid bitch even wrote it down before she quit', referring to the old manager I was replacing. I didn't write it down afterwards, just forgot since it was a bit busy. Next day she calls again. I said I didn't write down the order and she loses her mind. 

*""This is bullshit! I shouldn't have to tell you what I want to order every morning! It's the same fucking thing everyday! You're such an idiot! I don't have time to be on the phone with your stupid lounge everyday!""*

This goes on over the phone for 10 minutes before she finally tells me her order. I shut my brain off and only responded with one syllable answers specifically about the order, after I kept interrupting her rant to ask if she wanted to order anything or just yell. She didn't listen to a word I said. When she came down, she shoved an elderly woman out of the way in the line and screamed *'MY ORDER, NOW!'* at my teenage employee until she cried because she was too scared to interact with her.

I told the manager about her behaviour and apparently this is super common and we can't do anything due to her member status. When she comes to the lounge to get her order, the front desk has to call a cab immediately and if it isn't there in five minutes she loses her mind and threatens the front desk staff. They've started calling it early but if she takes too long and the cab leaves, she again will verbally assault the staff until the next one arrives.

My most recent interaction with her was awful. The two days leading up to this event, I told her I'd try to have her order ready each day of her stay so she didn't need to call down. If I miss her phone call she loses it on everyone so I try to keep her interactions with others to a minimum. Bad idea on my end. 

It was a very busy day where I was alone in the lounge and barely got a second to breathe. I forgot to punch in her order as time completely got away from me. She comes down past her usual pick up time looking for her order. I apologized profusely because I got too busy and forgot, but that did nothing. With my GM standing right next to me and with a lobby full of guests, she launched into a very loud tirade that was apparently audible as far as the back office. 

*""YOU FUCKING RETARD, ARE YOU FUCKING SERIOUS?! WHAT THE HELL IS  WRONG WITH YOU?! YOU'RE SO FUCKING WORTHLESS, FUCKING IDIOT!""*

This goes on for fifteen minutes as she screams about how she can't spend all day in my 'shitty little lounge' because 'unlike me, she has a real job to get to'. Guests are gawking, GM is quietly apologizing since he's dealt with this many times before and hates her as much as I do. I turned the route of downright ignoring her, taking care of other guests that I was worried she was disturbing. 

She left just before her order was ready, yelling at me for her missing her cab (which left 10 minutes prior to her coming down from her room, by the way), still shouting slurs and obscenities, which I find somewhat funny because *her and I are both Chinese*.

Other patrons couldn't tell that this was a super common occurrence and how it doesn't really faze me anymore and they all tipped me great, stating that 'that lady needed therapy'. It was a really nice gesture from them. We are well-known for having extremely courteous and kind guests. 

Any way, that's the story so far of The Good Doctor. She returns on three days, here's hoping I don't end up with more story material.",151,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CDD4A700>
749,Quick story of a school team,"1:24am I see kids walk onto property with a sign from a business across street, attempt to call coaches of the kids in room but phone wasn't going through.

Called police they came about an hour later when the night quieted for them.

Showed officer camera of them I told him what room coaches were in he woke em' up and then they inspected all the kids rooms.

Kids had stolen several signs from the sidewalk and businesses and were drinking as well... this is a high school basketball team.

Officer was very chill gave kids a good scare didn't put anything permanent down to ruin their futures but let the coaches/school/parents deal with the aftermath.

750,"So long, farewell, auf Wiedersehen, adieu","In honor of the departure of the NA we hired in September, who turned out to be kind of a idiot/con artist (best quote: “I don’t care about this job, I don’t do it for the money, my real job is bitcoin”, said to me, his manager), I thought I’d share his greatest hit. 

Our story takes place on a Friday night, around 11pm, at our charming little boutique hotel. The hotel is fully booked. We have one room that we block every weekend because it’s really small and we usually only give it to corporate guests who are traveling alone. Our protagonist: the weekend NA, who’s been here for a couple of months, who we’ll call Bitcoin.

Bitcoin is taking care of his nightly tasks, or most likely ignoring them and doing something completely unrelated instead. In walks a lady, with confident strides and the air of someone who means business. We’ll call her Sheriff for reasons that will become obvious.

Bitcoin: Good evening, do you have a reservation?
Sheriff: I don’t. However, I am a Very Important Brand GM.

At this point, Sheriff produces a badge with a flourish and slams it on the desk. Or at least I imagine that’s how it happened. It’s a plastic badge with the brand name emblazoned on it, the type you could probably have made for like, 10 bucks. No further information is on the badge. She speaks with great authority.

Sheriff: Since I’m a Very Important Brand GM, you HAVE to give me a room. For free. 

Bitcoin: Uh, okay, do you have ID?

Sheriff: I lost it. Here’s the not at all fake paper I got from city hall proving my identity while a new one is being issued.

Can you guess what our unlikely hero did at this point of the story? Followed logic and common sense and asked the Very Important Lady why she was waltzing in at 11pm without calling in advance to check if we had availability? Told her that we were fully booked? Informed her that he was sorry but he didn’t have the authority to comply to her request? Asked for a credit card to at least take a guarantee before we checked her story in the morning?

If you answered no to all the above questions, ding ding ding. You win nothing,  except maybe a rage ulcer like yours truly.

No, our friend Bitcoin proceeds to take nothing, no CC information, takes a picture of the badge that probably comes from a toy store, and gives her a key to the room that is blocked. He doesn’t create a reservation and leaves the room blocked. Sheriff says she’ll come to the desk in the morning to square everything out. Obviously she didn’t do that, dropped her key on the side of the desk while the AM receptionist was busy with another guest and flew away to presumably scam someone else. 

This lady probably tried every hotel in our area until she found someone, ahem, let’s say naive enough to fall for her scam. My GM, myself, and everyone this side of the equator had a massive coronary when we read the incident report, and when I first debriefed with Bitcoin I think I spent a good five minutes just staring at him and saying “How? Why? What the ever-loving fuck????????”. It has now become a funny story that we’ll tell at staff parties for the next million years.

So, dear NA who worked here for 3 months, farewell. We hardly knew ye, but frankly I didn’t feel the need to know more. I won’t get to say goodbye since you put yourself on medical leave for the last two weeks of your probation period, but that’s okay too. I wish you success in your future Bitcoin endeavors.

EDIT: I just remembered this actually happened a Saturday, because it was *the same day* as my [no good very bad day](https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheFrontDesk/comments/qjbusn/a_no_good_terrible_very_bad_day_and_no_lunch/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf).

751,My last day as a hotel employee,"Another post here about impatient guests made me reflect on the straw that broke the camels back for me, and what ultimately pushed me to walk out only a week into my 2 weeks notice at my last job of almost 3 years as a front desk. I wanted to post awhile back as my final story here but...here ya go. 

(Also, sorry for editing as I am on mobile.)

I had been getting really sick of the grief I would get from guests who had no patience when I worked the 3-11 as the ONLY staff member on premise.

On top of the shitty pay ($11/ hr while some new employees got hired on at $13 and up, even with no experience), a manager who talked shit about us all behind our backs, constantly micromanaged us and yelled at us for making mistakes she herself made regularly and who took at least 2 pto days a week while the rest of us worked OT and were denied time off, the guests acting like primadonnas staying at a 5 star resort while they were actually staying at our crappy ass economy hotel were the icing on the crapcake for me. 

In october, I started feeling the burn out and my friend ended up getting me referred for her company. Work from home, $17 /hr to start, full time, excellent benefits and the people are GENUINELY incredible. Anywho, Nov 7 was supposed to be my last day and I had fully intended to leave that day. Then on Nov 1 I had a guest that was just enough of a douchebag for me to say ""fugget"".

I called my boyfriend to grab all my work shirts and a spare t shirt for me and bring them to the lobby.

So on this evening, had a friend who drives for Uber/Lyft in the lobby visiting for a few minutes cuz he was in the area and I told him I was stepping away for a sec to use the restroom.

No sooner had my ass hit the toilet, he texts me ""theres a guy in here who is really pissed off waiting on you"". I told him ""that sucks, he can wait"" and he replied ""he needs a key and he's being a huge asshole""

So I finish peeing and wash my hands, (we are talking less than 5 minutes), and as I walk into the lobby this guy and a buddy of his start slow clapping as I walk back behind the desk, congratulating me on my return. Mind you, I was familiar with this dicklick cuz he had been an absolute fuckface since his check in. (Always needing keys made, always snarky and berates you if you dont stroke his ego, laugh at his jokes, seem impressed by his bs stories...you get the picture.) This was the last straw for me on an already shitty day and I decided that was it.

I looked him dead in the eye and said ""Lemme guess, you need ANOTHER key and couldn't wait 5 minutes for me to use the restroom?"".

He gets an attitude, of course, bitching about my customer service and how hes gonna be talking to my manager in the morning. So I made his key, smiled at him and said ""Good luck. As of 11 pm tonight, shes not even my manager anymore. You caught me on my last day.""

I clocked out, changed my shirt, left all my work shirts, dirty and clean, in a walmart bag with my name tag on my managers desk and never went back.

Had a nice week long vacation and now I work 4-10 hour days in my pajamas with a company I genuinely love working for. And I am NEVER working in hotels again. 

*I do want to thank all the fellow hotel employees on this subreddit. You all really got me through some tough days and made me feel I wasn't alone. I have enjoyed my time here and I totally understand if I need to leave now that I am no longer a hotel employee. But you all gave me so much laughter and hope in a job I hated more than anything. So thank you. Very much.
God bless you, everyone.",19,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CDD4A070>
752,The guy who definitely knows where all his money is.,"Today’s story starts with your typical middle aged “good ole’ country boy” coming to check in during my night shift, of course not wearing a mask. I didn’t tell him to put one on because the area that I’m in has recently dropped the mask mandate, for now, and I knew it would only cause a fight with this type of guy. He gave off this vibe that he knew he was better than me and anyone else, and just sighed as if he was bored and has done this whole checkin thing at a hotel a million times, knows how everything works, and just wants it to be over. Mid-tier member with high-tier member mentality as I like to think of it.

Me: “Can I see your ID and credit card please? The card will just be to have on file for incidentals since this is a points stay.”

Him: *while handing me his ID*  “But why, it’s already paid for?”

 
Me: “Yes, this is a points stay so your card won’t be charged, it’s just to have on file in case there are any incidentals that we need a method of payment for.”

 
Him: *visibly annoyed* ""There’s one on file, just use that.""

 
Me: “Absolutely, but I just need to see it in person to verify that it is yours and the one we have on file matches the one you intend to use. You’d be surprised how many will book a reward stay but not remember which card they have on file or will want to switch it for whatever reason.”

 
Him: “Oh, I thought you were going to run the card. I know where all my money is, so I’m not confused.” *shows me the card so I can see his name and the last 4 digits, everything checks out*

 
Me: “Thank you, I’ll just get you checked in and make your keys.” *GASP! His card declines for our whopping $1 incidental hold!*


Me: “Oh, it looks like it won’t allow me to check you in because your credit card declined. It has to be able to authorize for $1”

Him: *looking down to avoid eye contact while shoving a different card at me before I had even finished speaking* “Here. I don’t have a lot of money on that card.”

Dude why. Why give me all that crap only for your card to decline, since you're oh so educated as to where all your money is. Was it worth it? We literally had to change cards anyway and it made you look like a stupid asshole. It’s like taking 3 right turns when you could have just gone left in the first place, we ended up in the same place, only with a lot of useless attempts to circumvent the rules on your part. 

It's pretty obvious he was trying what everyone who doesn't understand how this stuff works tries, which is give me a card with no money in hopes that we won't get any of it. That shit never works, I always make sure I have every cent authorized that I'm supposed to have before I even make keys. 

I finish the checkin process and hand him his keys. He went outside and back in several times through our locked door, and instead of having a key handy to unlock the door himself (per the sign right on the front door, literally in his face), he expected the busy night auditor to unlock the door for him every. single. time. And never thanked me. I don’t need to be thanked, but this type of attitude turns toxic real fast and I’ve had to deal with it my whole life. Also, one of the times he walked through he told me I don’t have to wear “that stupid looking mask just for me.” Oh gee, thanks guy, so glad I have YOUR permission to avoid a rule put in place by the corporation who pays me. Also, at this point, I wear them even when I don’t have to just to annoy assholes like him, so I told him yes, I do in fact have to. He just responded with a head shake and walked off. What a treasure.

753,Am I in the wrong?,"I am a FOM at an 87 room hotel. Today we had 60 check outs and 45 check ins. We are running 80% occupancy. The GM was off today and that made me MoD. I noticed around 3pm that there were still 29 rooms on change (most of which were for incoming arrivals). I was told the housekeeping manager was on lunch and since I had to inspect all the fire extinguishers in the hotel I decided to do a round of room inspections to see what else I could punch in clean.
  Our check in is 5pm btw. So I get to the end of the last floor of inspections and have punched in 12 rooms when I finally hear the Hskp manager on the radio again telling a housekeeper to go down and help laundry pick up the pace. I radio him letting him know I was just finishing a round of inspections if he wanted to go down to laundry to help them out too since i was already two-thirds done. He replied saying “no, I’ll continue inspections.” Okay…

So I finish the floor I am on and notice that there is dirty linen in the hallways the entire length of the third floor. If I if the housekeeping manager checking a room and he’s going off an old dirty list so I crossed off the 12 rooms Inspected and let him know about the dirty linen. He decided to chastise me for not asking him if he wanted help so he could tell me what to do to help. Because “he was hired to inspect rooms and delegate tasks to his employees.”

He’s been at the hotel for about 6 months, I just hit the 3 year mark. We’re a small hotel and all the departments help one another. All my desk agents know how to inspect rooms, do laundry, strip rooms, set up breakfast, etc. He told me I shouldn’t butt into his department. I responded that his department has an effect on mine and if they’re falling behind or I’m asked by “his” housekeepers I’m going to help
Am I in the wrong?

UPDATE: Thank you all for your insights and thoughts. I’ve reached out to the GM and told him I wanted to speak with him about the situation. I’ll post with an update after that.",10,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CDD4A610>
754,It's not my fault you're spouting absolute gibberish?,"So, I guess my week of hell will just continue after my days off. Why not? 

There's a holiday party in house and all of them got drunk. Not just a little drunk. Full on, needing help to get into building and not talking actual words drunk. None of them know how to function as human beings anymore. Not all of them are bad, some of them are funny. 

But this one man. *Man,* was he something. He was completely out of it. I think it was more than alcohol by the looks of him, but I mean, hey, it is what it is. He walks up to the desk holding his keys and:

Man: Is that I need to go home?

Me: . . . What?

Man: Am I good to go. . . home?

Me: Are you good to go home?

The man nods and then thrusts his car keys into my hand, he's angry now. Upset his nonsensical chatter isn't comprehending: I'm good to go home, now? That's all you need?

Me: I don't know what these keys are for.

Man: To go HOME! Can I go home now?

Me:  . . . you mean into your *room?*

The man nods, exasperated and relieved now that my tiny mind finally understood his intelligent request.

Me: You need a room key for that. . . do you have a room here?

He does.

Me: Okay, what's your first and last name and I can get you a *hotel room key.*

He tells me his name and I make him a key. Because he's already checked in, and has been checked in for hours I didn't think about him wanting a slip to put it in, but no, now he's upset. He demands the covers with the room number on it!

Man: Why can't I have that paper? You just expect me to find it on my own? Are you even going to give me a general location of my room?

I tell him his room number and give him the slip that he demanded. Then he goes back to pushing his keys at me.

Me: I don't need your keys. . . ?

Man: Well you SAID I needed a key. 

Me: That's what I just gave you, *A hotel room key for room 410.*

Man: Well! Well I didn't know! You should let people know these things!

And while I was typing this up, I'm in the middle of audit, so no credit card terminals. Cash or Room charging only. Something I can write and post later. Another man comes down and this ruins his life. God forbid he not get those two beers, and he doesn't carry cash, and he's not supposed to charge anything to the room. *But he promises to pay it back later!*

Yeah. No, you have to pay buddy? Why do you think you can just *not* pay. I'm supposed to take you on your word for it that you'll pay? Nope. Not going to have the sales manager down my ass for missing inventory.",9,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CDD4AE80>
755,Don’t feel bad for clocking in & clocking out!,"I just want to let those of you who are new to hotels know that you don’t owe that place your life! Yes! You should do your best, learn everything you can and take on challenges head first. Hopefully with a supportive leadership team in place behind you. However work life balance is essential to your well being and should be non negotiable. 

Also to my hotel veterans, I know things have gotten more difficult but please don’t be part of the problem. If you’re a GM calling people on their day off for non emergencies, shame on you. You set the tone and even you need boundaries. 

If you are a Manager calling work on your day off for non emergencies, STOP. Have some boundaries and if you’ve trained your team properly then there shouldn’t be much to worry about… right? 

If your property falls apart or can’t function without you then that’s a problem not a flex. It’s hard enough to staff hotels these days without burnout threatening to destroy what little team you have left. New hires are only getting younger and thankfully they value their overall physical and mental health over the billionaire their clocking in to make more millions. 

If you live and breath your hotel then good for you , I DONT ! You aren’t better at your job because you stay at work the longest. That just makes you inefficient with poor time management skills. Work life balance isn’t a buzz word it’s essential. It’s up to leaders to encourage healthy working hours and availability because your staff is watching and learning.",42,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CDD4AA00>
756,People need to be patient,"Anyone who doesn’t live under a rock knows the service industry is suffering and has been. We still struggle with staffing, and right we have no evening houseman, which means front desk has to get the things for guests when they request them. 

I go upstairs to give a room pillows and grab some more to take downstairs to keep in the office to avoid extra trips. It didn’t take probably more than 5 minutes, but to some that’s the end of the world. When i come back i see a guest waiting to check in. She has the luggage cart pulled all the way up to the desk. 
 
When i leave the desk, i always put a sign out explaining that i had to step away and will be back soon. That was up. 

This woman scoffs: i was just reading about the deskless check in!

Me: sorry how can i help?

Her: checking in!

I check her in and hands her the keys. She’s visibly annoyed the whole interaction. 

Her: this better be a quiet room!

Me: oh, it certainly should be 

Walks off barely saying thank you and am annoyed when i give them basic but important info on the hotel. 

We have a bar on property where you can order drinks and food, it’s connected to the lobby. When it’s slow, the bartender will take a quick break, restock, etc. A woman storms over “is the bar and dinner service not open???” It’s an hour after it opened, so of course it is. 

“It is! She may have just stepped away for just a moment to get something. She should be back soon!”

Within a matter of a minute, this woman walks to the bar, then walks out the door with her husband. Then seconds after that the bartender comes out of the bathroom, meaning she wasn’t away for more than two minutes.

757,Any ideas on how to make my guests understand I can't read peoples minds either?,"Sorry got a quick rant about this.

During Corona, front desk at our hotel doubles for both checking in hotel and sauna guests. Due to distance restrictions, not more than 8 people may be within the sauna at any given time. It’s been like this for almost two years now, so this isn’t news to anyone. Also: our sauna is open to both hotel guests and the public.

Now we have a lot of regulars (not hotel guests, just people from the general area) who come for the sauna and nothing else. Some of them learned to call ahead of time, but most just show up. And whenever I tell them “I’m sorry, sauna is full.” they follow up with “When will the next one come out then?”

How the heck am I supposed to know that? There’s no time limit (because we would be unable to enforce it, I’m not even allowed to enter the spa area in my uniform) and it’s not like people that enter loudly announce when they’ll leave. I explain that (in very different words, obviously) every time, but they just keep asking. Anybody got a good way for me to say “the heck would I know?” a little more politely?

This happened a few months ago.

Ok, so... I work NA, part time, midweek. At one time I was FT NA but dropped back to PT several years ago. I haven't had the 'pleasure' of working with a wedding party in years (and haven't missed it).

Imagine my surprise when my GM  told me that we had a wedding party checking in mid week. I mean, wth? A wedding party, in a pandelerium, mid-week??? GM even warned me that this group seemed like a particularly 'demanding' group. I was dreading it so hard.

Y'all already know, every wedding party ever you can count on at least 3 people locking *themselves* out of their rooms, with no ID and zero clues. At least one person will get locked out of their room by their spouse/partner/room mate due to their obnoxious behavior. Several noise complaints are guaranteed. There will be at least one fight. All of this will somehow be my fault.

The whole pandelerium has made everything so much worse than it ever was that I was stressing out imagining how bad this would be.

So, I went to work as scheduled and find that the hotel is completely sold out. No Emergency rooms. Fun! I guess whoever gets thrown out of their room tonight will have to sleep in a car, or something.

I got as much done early as I could to prepare for the impending fiasco. Then I made sure my stockpile of masks was sufficient and brewed fresh coffee, anticipating drunken fools needing to sober up. I even stocked the tiny breakfast fridge with orange juice, anticipating hangovers. Finally I settled in to wait for it, determined to handle every crisis as professionally as possible.

And nothing happens.

Nothing. 

The phone did not ring. 

No one came to the lobby. 

There were no noise complaints. 

I mean, a *normal* Wednesday night is rowdier than this! No one even showed up to complain about the grab & go breakfast. I never even met a single member of the wedding party.

So that's it, that's the story... The wedding party that behaved. I would not have believed it possible.

*So, yeah, we all have guests who behave like decent humans. They don't make good stories and they don't tend to haunt us. Some guests do haunt us, those are the ones we need to talk about.*",25,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CDD4ADF0>

760,A Private Airport Front Desk is one of the wildest places I have worked,"Hello everyone! I am using a throwaway account, as I know at least one of my former managers uses Reddit and i don't need my main getting back to them.

I worked at a private airport in Florida for the uber rich (all of our clients were multimillionaires or richer) for a few years, just found this sub and I figured y'all would appreciate some of the bonkers stuff that happened while I held that position.

1) Within my first few months working there, I got fully mooned by a multibillionaire. He was putting something in the trunk of his car, and I happened to look out the window just as he bent over, exposing a solid 3/4ths of his ass. A coworker who was outside with the client at the time saw it too (although from a much less direct angle) and said the client didn't care at all that he had just essentially exposed himself to around 5 people, possibly because all of them either worked for him directly or for the airport.

2) Private airports are generally pretty small, and this one was no exception - the single runway was less than a mile long, and very narrow. I had to, on several different occasions, explain to people how numbers worked because they insisted that they would be able to land their plane at the airport with no problem whatsoever! Except their plane's wingspan was bigger than the width of the runway, and a quick Google usually told me that their aircraft also had a longer stopping distance than we could provide. Usually I would end up asking the clients (or, more often, the clients' assistants) to have their pilots call me, as I knew *those* people at least understood how wingspans vs runway width work! One client in particular called back about five or six times absolutely insisting that he could totally land -jet with a wingspan 16 ft wider than our runway- until I finally managed to get him to look at our website so he could see the palm trees and other hazards dotted along the runway.

3) it wasn't all bad, though - one day in the summer of 2020, I was working by myself (slow traffic day) when a small jet came in. I went out to help unload luggage and see if the pilots needed any services. The client was making polite conversation while I got his bags in his car, and I mentioned that i had just gotten back to qork after being furloughed for several months due to covid. He immediately pulled out his wallet and gave me a $100 tip, and said he was glad I had been able to come back to the airport! That wasn't the only 3-figure tip i got there, but it was the most memorable.

4) one time a very famous singer flew in for a day trip, which got all of our crew very excited (save for the managers, who had met him before). He was super nice and chatted with our ground crew guys for a while when he landed. When they were getting ready to leave a few hours later, i headed out to ask the pilot if they needed anything (ice, newspapers, etc) and got to meet the client as well. I asked him how his trip was and he very enthusiastically told me all about the great rueben he had for lunch, which is all i can think about now when I hear his music.

5) another singer [name removed on Mod's request] came one time to do a private concert, and i was explicitly warned ahead of time that he was on thin ice at our establishment, and if he did anything that I or my crew didn't like, we were to report it to the head of the dept immediately. Apparently, the first time he had visited, he had been really rude to the lovely ladies who worked the front desk at the attached hotel, and we had a strict ""no abuse of the staff"" policy - only place I've been where that was actually enforced! The singer was apparently much better behaved on his second trip, as i never heard more about it.

6) Nothing will give you a rush of power and adrenaline like telling an uber rich person no, and instead of them getting pissed, they start to *beg*. We had a very limited number of jets that could land every day, which meant reservations for holidays filled up very far in advance - I always worked Christmas day because the furthest out clients could book a trip was one year, so as soon as the terminal opened at 8 am, the phone was ringing with people making reservations for next year. I had many a phone call with desparate billionaires trying to fly in on busy days, only to be told they were 30 deep in the standby list. And if anyone complained too much, they were escalated to the head of the dept (occasionally all the way to the president), and no longer my problem.

I have some more stories that aren't strictly front desk related (my position meant that while i was on the desk probably 70% of the time, i did end up outside as part of the ground crew quite a bit, too), so if you guys are interested in those, let me know!",54,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CDD4AD30>
761,Shake-N-Bake Grandpa,"Working Night Audit at a big resort in North Carolina, we see some wild things happen at night. This happened about a month ago. 

This one is honestly so stupid, I don't know why the hotel didn't arrest this lady. Yes-- I know this is about to sound outlandish, but unfortunately I heard this from our Food and Beverage managers for the resteraunts on property.

One of the late night F&B managers was venting to me about their day and said ""you wouldn't believe the day I've had. Did you hear about the ashes?""

Apparently,... Some elderly woman booked a dining reservation with a friend for lunch. She came to the table and ate a normal dinner. After the meal, she went outside to our terrace outside the resteraunt and pulled out an urn with her husband's ashes. The guest then dumped her husband's cremated remains from the terrace....

But it wasn't like a movie, where the wind swept them away and carried grandpa's ashes downwind and he was thrilled.

... No, it was where there was ANOTHER terrace underneath where she dumped the ashes... And they were setting up for a wedding later that day.

The catering and decorating team was absolutely infuriated and called security, wondering why someone dumped ashes all over their tables they were working on for a late wedding later that day.

Security confronted the woman and said ""m'am, why did you do this?""

She said, ""well, my husband murdered his mistress that he cheated on me with. Then, he killed himself. Well, I figured since this was the last place we were happy on an anniversary... That'd I'd dump him here!""

I was so shaken by this story, I asked if they called the cops or anything like that. The F&B manager said they didn't, she just went down and helped clean up grandpa and just wanted the lady the hell out of the way.

The title comes from our fellow third shifters overnight attacking this story, imagining crazy scenarios like the lady putting the urn across from her while at the lunch table and sneaking grandpa some mozzarella sticks! Shake-N-Bake grandpa lives on with our local haunts overnight now. 😂 I can't believe this actually happened.",20,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CDD4A130>
762,I just got robbed and I want to scream,"God I feel like shit. The ONE time I don't lock the doors.

I work as an night auditor and after ten pm am completely alone in the hotel, just me and my podcasts. It was 2.20am and the door was unlocked because a couple of minutes before some guests had come in and I have to walk to the door to lock it so I just left it and continued working. 

By the time I see them it's too late, a little kid no older than 12 comes in, followed by two adults. The kid goes around the desk towards the back office and I follow him saying dude you can't be here and he was acting crazy calling for his mom or something, but then I thought ""wait I can't leave the other two alone"" so I came back and asked what they wanted, the kid came back out clutching something underneath his jacket and they just left.

I locked the door, checked the office and saw that a laptop from corporate was missing and freaked out. Called my boss who just asked me if I was okay and said that there was nothing I could've done. 

They didn't threaten me or even asked for anything, I didn't try to grab the kid for fear of retaliation from the other two.

That's it I just wanted to vent. Luckily it was just a computer and nothing happened to me but I'm so angry right now",117,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CDD4AFD0>
763,Do other hotels allow check in with the use of a picture of their ID on their phone? Because I feel like we're the only ones who don't.,"Maybe  I'm old-fashioned here, but I can't understand why people think their  copy of their ID on their phone is good enough.  And what happened to  carrying a physical ID?  If something happens to me and paramedics need  to identify who I am, having a physical ID on my person makes sense as  opposed to being locked behind a password.

And  I'm constantly asked if we accept Apple Pay or Google Pay.  My hotel  accepts neither, and I have no idea if we're the only ones who don't  take these.

Or maybe I'm turning into a cantankerous old geezer.  You kids have it easy.  I had to walk to school uphill in the snow, blah blah blah.",188,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CDD4ADC0>
764,Employee discount form with wrong name and associate checked on it,"So today I had a couple come in to check in and they presented their discount form. Only problem is that it’s for the associate, and not the couple standing in front of me. The rate code was for the associate rate. I inform them that I would have to change the rate to our BAR, and if he could go on the portal and email the form I could change it back. The people on front of me claim it was their son, and they couldn’t get on the portal. I told them to email it before they check out and we can change it back to what is indicated on the form. He then states that he wants to cancel the reservation and we better not charge him. I told him that accounting makes that decision, but considering it’s an employee rate should he dispute the charge we would be in contact with his HR department. 

Now they did check in, and the guests are all demanding my manager. It’s 10:30 at night. I’ll give them her email, but nothing more. The supervisor did take care of them, but they did pay BAR rate. We also have his form with his manager’s name and contact number on it. I also made sure to contact my union rep on this one. Now the guest is claiming that their son, who is the associate, is the front office manager of the location that he works. I’m thinking the entire time that he should know the rules regarding the employee discount program. I mean can’t they see the hole they’re digging themselves? If they did cancel I’m putting the reason that they booked an invalid rate.",12,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CDD4AD60>
765,Shoes don't belong in the gas fireplace,"Hello All,

I would like to thank our wonderful Olive Garden waiter in Christiansberg, VA for providing me with the information that this subreddit exists! I was in VA visiting some inlaws and he told me all about r/talesfromthefrontdesk. I've worked overnight at a large resort in North Carolina for the past four years as a Night Auditor and I have SO many stories to tell.

This one has a picture included :o

*

We have a large gas fireplace in our lobby...

My co-worker was sorting receipts and I was typing on the computer, when we both heard a loud THUNK towards the fireplace. There are about ten rocking chairs around the fireplace and there are several late night patrons who brought their own booze, drinking in the lobby around 1AM.

I didn't pay it any mind; we were behind in our work and I was hyper focused on finishing... until another loud THUNK echoed.

My coworker looked up and was baffled. ""We need to call security,"" he said. I was bewildered and asked ""why?"" , to which he said ""the guest threw their shoes in the fireplace.""

I gazed upward and saw the expensive loafers roasting on the gas fireplace, promptly calling security and engineering as they were in route. My dumbass didn't even think to turn OFF the gas fireplace because I was so dumbfounded that someone did this.

Our female security guard walked over to him and questioned the drunk guest: ""sir, why did you put your shoes in the fireplace?""

He slurred, ""I thought it was a good idea.""

The officer said ""no, no I don't think it was.""

Cue to the smell of burning rubber, as my dumbass realized now that the expensive loafers are smoking. I immediately panicked (being through overnight fire alarms before is stressful) and RAN through the lobby opening all the windows and doors as Engineering turned off the gas fireplace and began stomping out the on fire shoes.

My older engineer coworker is an average built white older man who is comedically stomping on the fire shoes in the fireplace in front of everyone, pausing for a few moments while resting his weight on the back of his hips, only to vigorously stomp at the shoes again.

We finally had the shoes put out and no fire alarm went off. Security had the man escorted to his room while we let the shoes cool overnight. 

The front desk MOD offered the man his shoes back in the AM and he didn't take them 😂

WTF is wrong with guests? 

Here is a picture of the shoes afterward...Shoes from the gas fireplace... https://imgur.com/a/yi1QVl4

766,Lost+Found: Lost teddy bear,"It's late night and an email ticks in... 

Guest that checked-out earlier that day, has a kid that is missing his teddy bear. Kid can't fall asleep without it's favorite teddy bear. So they wish to see if we have found it in the room they checked-out of.

Having a kid myself and understanding the situation, I take action immediately. 

Few moments later, I am making Lost+Found report that we have the lost item. Our system will also let guests know if we have it or not. So I am not replying to email, so not to have two threads of communication with the guest. 

I attach even a picture of the teddy bear. Short after, we have a response from the guests, and it is correct toy, they want to have it shipped. But it's Friday night and earliest we can have it collected is Monday morning. As guests are from the same country, they understand limitations of postal services and having it sent with courier will be too expensive for them. So agreement is shipment first thing on Monday. 

What guests do not know, I am not going to dispatch collection notice to postal service. But as they are ""short"" de-tour away from my home, I will deliver this when I finish my shift. 

^(Small de-tour is actually 45 miles. But it's okay, I understand the situation...) 

I am off in the morning, and type in their address and drive off... 

They do not know I am coming. So at around 8.00 in the morning I am knocking on the door, in my uniform, so they can recognize me as someone from my hotel and perhaps not some sort of sales person. 

I guess they were still sleeping... I have been knocking on the door for 10-15 minutes. Even their neighbor was looking at me strangely, from across the street that was doing some gardening. So I head to the neighbor and ask if they know if they are at home. He phones them and they are coming to the door... 

Few moments later, I can hear kid running toward front door... 

I stick teddy bear in front of me, so that is the first thing he sees... 

He screams in joy and yells to his mom, that is also on her way, that ""postman"" came with his teddy bear. 

I get my signature for delivered item, as proof and archives, and head home to my kid. 

Mission accomplished!

*This is story for that one comment, from my previous post, that accused me/us in here of being fed up with guests and this and that... That we are all bunch of negative people and bla bla...* 

*We are not, we all have more guests that have positive to say about us and vice versa, than negative. But negative stories are so outrages sometimes that shock you, and you got to share it with someone. Hope this gives a bit nuance and shows us in another light as well.*",33,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CDEC5610>
767,Full Frontal Nerdity (UPDATE),"TW: Depression, thoughts of suicide

So a handful of months ago,  I posted about a group of guys who called me during my audit shift to ask if it would be cool to play Dungeons and Dragons in the hotel lobby a night.  [Original post here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheFrontDesk/comments/pakg0t/full_frontal_nerdity/)  I figured, since there was a lot of love an activity on the original post, you dandy folks might like to hear what's been going on with these wayward nerds.

They meet in the lobby every Tuesday after midnight to play D&D.  They picked up a new player about a month ago and I look forward to coming to work every week to see these guys.  I've helped out their DM work on his homebrewed setting, they got me in the Discord server, and it's been a really fun experience having them.  They still pick up snacks and sodas from the hotel, even though I've told them they don't have to anymore, and our new GM has given them the okay to stay for breakfast.

They game, we laugh, we talk crap.  I introduced them to a couple of other systems and settings (Savage Worlds and Mouseguard specifically) and they even agreed to help me playtest the mechanics for the Ghostbusters game I've been putting together for a while now.

What's really been positive is the impact they've been having on my mental health.  For the past couple of months, I've not really been in a great state.  I've been covered by this amorphous blob of sadness and self-loathing and can't seem to pull myself out of it.  It's been escalating lately to where I've even had thoughts of ending my life.  They come as quickly as they go, but it's still a concern.  I'm not sure how much of my depression has been tied to the birth of my son.

Well, the guys noticed the other night that I wasn't really myself.  I'd been feeling like this for quite some time, as I said; I simply didn't have the energy to hide it that night.  They paused their session and just talked to me for a while.  I felt bad for imposing on their game, but...it was really positive.  One of the guys, who's playing a Bard, even gave me the information for his therapist.

I guess the point to all this is, everyone, our line of work can be a grueling, unforgiving slog.  But it's not all entitled man-children and shady hooligans.  You can sometimes find something bright and positive that makes you look forward to clocking in for your shift.  For me, it's six dorky package handlers who just happened to need a place to to unwind after work with a game.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Edit:  Everyone, thank you so much for all this love and support.  I've had a lot of really great people reach out and check in.  I'm not okay, but I'm managing it a little easier.  For anyone wondering, I have been actively seeking a therapist for about a month not, and I'm contacting the Bard's tomorrow.  I've gotten some other resources from you kind folks, and I'm honestly touched.

Thank you everyone for the awards, the kind words, the thoughtfulness of reaching out, and generally making me have a little more faith in myself.",67,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CDEC5CA0>
768,Frustrated with new hires,"We had our Night Auditor (NA) leave us for a better paying hotel outside our town earlier this year and we've been struggling to find a good fit for his/my replacement (I ended up asking to take over as the main Night Auditor since my BF had a similar situation at his work place). At my location our Night Shift member cooks and sets up breakfast for the breakfast attendant who comes in 15mins before it starts and then they take over the breakfast area.

My boss ended up hiring the 1st person she got and seemingly didn't ask some basic questions and thought it was a good idea to start his 1st day of training on Night Shift instead of getting him to learn the basics 1st during morning or evening shift. For those who don't know, this is a very bad idea because you have to already know how the hotel system works in order to be the last resort and correct payment/charge problems that other coworkers might have done, meaning he would have no previous training on what he was even looking at. Another problem with this is the Night Shift hardly checks any guests in (At least in my area) so he wouldn't really get to learn the system if he wasn't getting to check anyone in. I did what I could with him and basically focused on teaching him how to handle and prep breakfast properly for 2-3 days before finally convincing my boss that he needs to do hands on training during the other shifts 1st before I can teach him how to do NA.

Training was extremely frustrating. He wasn't the 1st person I've ever trained, and I'm used to training others because I've a lot of patience so I'm usually the manager's 1st pick to train others, this included previous jobs outside the hotel business. This guy was the 1st person I've trained that I've ever stressed out over. I had him complete his online training courses, verbally told him what I was doing for each task, why I was doing them, why other options wouldn't work or would only cause extra problems, wrote or typed instructions for him to read or use as a refresher, had HIM write down instructions, and used visual examples. Nothing worked for this guy. I would use one learning method, and it would work for a week or 2, then he would stop doing it correctly and when my boss or I would tell him to do the task the correct way, and how to do it, he would claim ""Well nobody told me to do XYZ that way!"" in a defensive tone every time with us talking to him in a calm manner. There was even a time where my boss told me to tell him how to fold our cleaning rags for the housekeeping carts since he was doing them wrong, I had him watch me fold one the proper way, then leave it where I folded it for him so he had an example to look at, he'd claim he understood and make me feel like I could believe him because ""Anyone can fold a towel, IDKY you are having to teach me this"" and find out the next day that he still did them wrong.

I also had to teach him what a cookie/baking sheet was, 4 days in a row, it's the only item we have in the kitchen area that even looks like one, the rest of the kitchen gear are tall trays and pots. My boss attempted to let him be the main NA and it was HELL. He would call me every. single. night. Most of the time it would be 3-5 times a night, just for the NA work alone. It was driving me crazy, it was like I was having war flashbacks every night I would be home and my cell would ring. I was no longer enjoying my time at home and would prefer to be working instead. I told my boss every week for the 3 months he worked here that I would rather work every night with no days off then have him work there any more, it was truly awful. I've never in my life felt this must frustration towards anyone I've trained, he pushed all the buttons I didn't know even existed and his lack of being able to handle the job caused many problems for guest's bank accounts and even made a few of our regulars stop staying at our hotel which is the main thing that kept us afloat during the height of recent events.

Now I have this new lady that I also trained to cover the position I was doing, the evening shift with 2 nights of NA so that NA can get days off. Everything was seemingly good with her, she's been here about 2 months now and claims this is all easy work (it is) and that she's got this. Now I have HER doing similar things that the 1st guy was doing. She's not doing breakfast properly and is pissing off our breakfast lady, she's calling me for simple NA things that only take a couple button presses to fix, and she too is claiming ""Nobody told her that she should be wiping the tables down"", or ""I wasn't told I have to have the items in the mini fridge full when breakfast starts"" when I know both myself and my boss told her. I taught her to treat every breakfast as if the 1st person to come in is an inspector, everything needs to be full, or give the elusion of being full via spacing items out more. Tonight I come in and she closed her shift before I even got signed in and of course someone comes to get a room while I'm counting the cash and she not only tells him to wait on me instead of checking him in, she then proceeds to repeatedly speak over the guest and I during check-in, and yell across the room to a different guest to ask her some questions. I could tell the guy I was checking-in was annoyed by her but was polite about it so I ended up having to apologize to him about her actions after she left. She's suppose to keep her shift open til I confirm that all the cash is there, answer the phone, and check guests in til I'm done because she's not suppose to leave until then so that I can't claim that she had money missing, and make it so guests are still being serviced without waiting.

We have another trainee learning this week since my boss is going to look into replacing her but I don't have high hopes for him either since this guy is unfortunately struggling to see or read info from both guest's IDs and the computer monitors, causing him to be very slow, slow enough for people to give up and ask me to do it for him or flat out cancel the reservation and leave. I'm worried about my boss keeping this 3rd person for to long because he told me that he's getting a divorce and is trying to move out of their place and I fear we'll keep him for to long, find out it's not going to work out, and then he's stuck in a new place with no job and can't pay the rent. I didn't think this job was that hard for anyone to learn, or maybe my old coworker cursed this place on his way out or something lol.",15,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CDEC5AC0>

Me-hey 

Ng- hey

Me- hey (in as nice a voice as i can be) um yea just fyi we arent allowed to let guest drink in the lobby. Our liquor license doesnt cover it. So you need to go tell those guys they cant drink down here. 

Ng- (with the nastiest attitude) well theyve been down here for a while. 

Me- ok? You still need to go tell them

Ng- im not telling grown ass men they cant drink. 

Me- um its not about that. Its about hotel policy. We can get fined our license isnt set up like a bar or restaurant. Im letting you know for future reference. 

Ng- well im still not telling them if you dont like it then you can let the gm know. 

Me-the gm already knows about the policy and is on my side with it. Im just letting you know. 

Ng- you can go tell them then cause i am not. 

I do go tell them cause im not going to be the one getting in trouble or fined. And not surprisingly they were like ok no problem and threw their bottles away. 

Ok first off new chick i dont know you. I havent even met you until tonight. Second im not even awake yet so coming at me with attitude 2 min into meeting you is not the best idea. And 3rd you have been here for 2 weeks ive been here for a year i know more about the ins and outs of the hotels policies than you ever will. 

When im trying to keep you out of trouble and help you out dont come back at me with a nasty ass attitude. My job is way more secure than yours.

770,does anyone else deal with this?,"im on mobile so forgive me if there's any mistakes. 

I work at a small privately own hotel. Recently we hired a new fda and she's alright except for the fact that everytime i come in for a night shift after her she leaves the laundry thats been folded hours ago on the counters and doesn't ever take it back to the laundry room (the front desk is responsible for laundry at the moment). It's quite annoying because I'm not sure if she knows she's supposed to take it back or if she just doesn't want to but i find myself sorting through it because i don't trust my coworkers to fold laundry right.

Literally everything is stained. We use stained towels as rags so they become very ugly and i have a coworker that tends to fold those into the clean pile and it confuses the fuck out of me. They're very obvious stains that are for our housekeepers to use as rags, for us to also use them in case there's a spill or leak or what ever. And she's just folding all the stained ones as if it's good and ready for housekeeping to put into rooms????? She's also kind of stupid so maybe that's why or she also just doesn't care but I literally have to refold everything right and into their correct piles or it'll bother me. I would NEVER let HK take this and put it into rooms but they somehow do it everyday. It's the same with linen. 

Should i confront these 2 coworkers and tell my boss? The owners are really cheap so we don't have a lot of back up and we get a lot of workers that stain them so we're constantly running out of stuff and we get so many bad reviews for it.

Buckle up boys, girls, neither or both, cause this is gonna be a long one. This story happened last year, during our very first corona summer. I was working front desk at a hotel pretty much in the middle of nowhere. Our hotel specialized in conference guests and since all conferences were canceled due to the virus, we were desperate to get some paying guests into our rooms.

So we made a deal with an online travel agency. Basically, Guests would pay half our normal prices per room and night and we would throw in literally everything we had for free. Breakfast, dinner, spa, gym, even your first drink at the bar on arrival, all on the house. Yes, this will be relevant later.

Enter our two entitled couples. Both had double rooms for the weekend. Now another relevant detail: we have two categories of rooms: standard and comfort. The deal was for a standard room, but our standard rooms are located in a separate building. So whenever we have comfort rooms available, we upgrade as much guests as possible. They get nicer rooms closer to the hotel facilities and we keep our ways for housekeeping and room service short.

So our two entitled couples check in and I inform them they received a free upgrade. They don’t react much, just take their keys and go to their rooms. A couple minutes later they meet at the bar and have their first gin tonic. Then a second one. And a third one. Did I mention this was around noon?

Anyway, while the two guys were at the bar, the two ladies came over to me at front desk, already a little tipsy, and the following conversation happened:

EW will be entitled women (I have no idea which one of them said what so might as well threat them as one), ME will be a Magical Entity. Or maybe just me.

EW: “Excuse me, we were wondering…”

ME: “Yes? How may I help?” (Expecting them asking for some directions or whatnot)

EW: “Well since we came here even though it’s a global pandemic out there, we’re obviously VERY loyal customers, so…” (They pause expectantly)

ME: “Yes, thank you very much.”

EW: “I mean… since we are such loyal customers, don’t we deserve a reward? Like a free room upgrade maybe?”

ME: “I’m sorry but you’ve already received a free room upgrade.”

EW: “We know. Another one, please.”

ME: “I’m afraid I cannot upgrade you a second time.” (Mostly since there were no rooms better than the ones they had, tbh)

EW: “Then a free bottle of champagne. Or a voucher. Like, around 20€ for each of us.”

ME: “I’m sorry I cannot do that either. You already have almost everything we offer included in your booking anyways, so, unfortunately, there isn’t much I can give you beyond that.”

They huff and puff and leave the front desk without another word. Three days later, we get the following review:

*Review (1 Star): We really, really wanted to have a free upgrade or a voucher for our next stay. We asked politely, but they refused! During the global crisis, guests like us, who didn’t cancel, should really be rewarded with a bonus of some kind. We had to pay FULL PRICE!!!*

Lady, you didn’t book a year in advance and then not cancel out of pure kindness of your heart. You booked the cheapest way possible, during the pandemic. You payed half our normal rate. You had everything included. You got your upgrade. But no, that’s just not enough for some people.",40,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CDEC5520>
772,Weirdos at 6AM,"I'm a night auditor at a mid-sized hotel chain everyone knows. 6 am rolls around and in waltzes this gentleman; he approaches the desk and tells me he has a reservation. ""Here we go,"" I think to myself, as I had 0 No Shows from the night before and knew this man was trying to check in 9 hours early. Now, I don't know about you guys, but I never allow this. If it was 1pm, MAYBE noon, and we had the room I'd let you check in, but 6 am??? Buddy, you're paying for an extra night. I explain this to him and he seems understanding, if a little upset. He walks out the door and says he'll be back at 3pm. That's the end of that, right? Nope! 

2 minutes later, in walks his ""lady friend,"" who is wearing a black T-shirt with the word HORNY in all caps (not making this up). She looks like she's on drugs and can barely walk straight. She approaches the desk and starts berating me for charging them for another night. She says she doesn't understand! What is she supposed to do??? I tell her the options are to pay for another night or find another hotel. We go back and forth for a while before she finally goes to get her ""husband.""

The man with her was actually very cool and understanding. He provided his debit card and we got them checked in, but not before the woman complained that she felt like I was ""breaking their legs"" lmao. They get up to their room and 10 min later I get a phone call from them. The woman is complaining that she can't get her phone to cast to the TV because its telling her she needs a ""code."" I think she may just need help changing the input to hook up to her Google Chromecast. Our TV remotes don't change the input, it's really annoying but we have to use the master remote at the front desk to change it for guests if they need to. So, I offer to go up there and change it for them.

I get up to the room and knock and the woman tells me to ""wait 10 seconds before I come in."" I tell her to just open the door when she's ready. She lets me in and she's in nothing but lingerie; she scurries back to the bed and is giggling profusely. I go to change the input and realize there is no Chromecast or anything else plugged into the TV. She says she doesn't have a device. I tell her these are not smart TV's, you can't cast anything from your phone to the TV without an external device. She then looks at me, frowns, and says, 'YOU'RE NOT HELPING ME AT ALL!"" 

The man she was with just sighs and thanks me for the trouble. What a couple.",62,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CDEC5340>
773,Am I paranoid and pessimistic or is this peculiar?,"It’s Tuesday and I’m running audit on a back computer in the office with the door closed because I think something’s up. Even if I’m wrong I’d rather be safe than sorry. 

But it’s after midnight and I get a phone call, there were no reservations ten minutes ago when I checked but now one solitary reservation is on my screen. The person on the phone asks what the room rates are, so I assume it’s someone wanting to book a room. So I tell him standard rates and about our deposit, then he asks about his reservation. He booked through reservations, so it’s the same rate, except his reservation is for two nights. He says he only needs it for one night. Okay. No problem I can fix that. 

Then he asks the biggest red flag question you can ask at 12 am: do you take apple pay? No, we don’t. We have to have a physical form of payment. He says he doesn’t have a card, but when I say that it is absolutely unwaivering policy he suddenly does have a card. 

He gets in and he’s with a much older guy that isn’t his dad. Of course he’s also underage (he is 20) and I have to get the man’s ID instead. They also rack up about $40 in snacks and when the older man starts to pay in cash the younger one insists on using the card. They mention a woman and being mad at her during this conversation so I’m already in alert mode. But they don’t say much more. 

They ask about malls in the area and seemed to have no idea where exactly they were and what kind of town it is. But that’s just a little odd.

The guy comes down and is muttering to himself, but there’s no headphones or anything- I can clearly see both ears as he paced back and forth through the lobby. He kept asking for a lighter or matches, but this is a nonsmoking property so we don’t carry those.  He couldn’t understand that. 

I watch him in the cameras go to the lobby bathroom, and down all the lobby level hallways. He stands in front of our only other entrance in the back for a long while before leaving out it. He came back through the front a few minutes later asking the same questions. 

He then apparently walked all the way to the closest gas station then caught a ride back, but there was no way. It’s raining and he was dry, and there wasn’t enough time for him to do that, even if he ran at a full sprint???

Am I just dramatic or is this really weird?",58,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CDEC5430>
774,"Either this lady is trying to rip us off, or she doesn't understand basic math.","I had a guest come in before my shift and paid cash for regular rate for  a room.  About 10 minutes ago, on my shift, she comes to the desk with  her AAA card to ask for the discount, and also to extend her room 2 more  nights.  Great, the $9 difference will go towards those extra nights.   But she wanted me to physically refund the cash.  And now she's  wondering why the price of her extra 2 nights costs $9 more

My previous topic got automodded probably because I called this dumbass a dumbass in the topic title.

775,"Prepare my bill, I will be checking out soon","You know, when you get certain calls from guests from certain parts of the world, and you just know, this is going to be a long process. 

So it's around 07.00 o'clock, and a phone call comes in from the room. Guest is informing us about his intentions of checking out so we can prepare his bill... 

I am, now imagining, how many people I should call to help me prepare his bill... but then it hit me... it's year 2021, and I have everything in one place... our PMS! It took me a second to type his room number in, another press on Enter I have entire bill in from of me... 

I spot few issues that are tell tails on this is going to take a long time...

At this point, I am considering to call the guest and inform him, that bill is ready, just for fun... But I do not do it... I do know, that guests from his region do have relaxed relationship to time... so soon is... anywhere from now to 2 hours from now. 

Guest comes down 40 minutes later and wants to check-out. But his whole attitude toward the process is like he already paid, I guess that is maybe what he expected to have been done when he called down.

I explain him the bill, that he did not pay at arrival (as per our SOP) but only paid partially. This is the tell tail I mentioned above. He maxed the card and was unable to settle the entire bill at once. He stayed here for 10 days, and did not bother coming by to settle his affairs. He comes from a region where banking system is like .... no not... swiss time pieces... word of mouth... So of course he will have no problem settling outstanding upon departure... And unicorns exist... 

ME: How would you like to settle outstanding amount?

G: On the card.

ME: Here we go. Terminal is ready for you. 

\*G presents the card\*

TERMINAL: Declined

ME: I am sorry, but transaction did not go thru. 

G: Try again.

ME: Okay, go ahead. 

TERMINAL: Declined

ME: Sorry sir, but it is still being declined. Do you have another card?

G: No. 

ME: We can try lower amount, to see if there is a limit on the card?

G: Okay.

\*Me type the same amount as he already paid\*

TERMINAL: Approved

ME: Okay, that seems to have worked. How would you settle the remaining amount?

G: Card. 

ME: Okay, go ahead. 

TERMINAL: Declined.

ME: Sorry but it seems like that amount was the limit. 

G: What do we do now?

\*As this is my problem somehow?\* 

ME: Well, you could try another card? 

G: Do not have another card.

ME: You can call your bank, it is midday over there now, so it should be open. 

G: No no... 

ME: I can see you are traveling on business, perhaps a colleague, that might help you out?

G: No colleague. 

ME: How about company, if you call someone from your company perhaps they can send us an email confirming that they will accept invoice for your charges?

G: They are not coming in this early. 

ME: If you know someone that can fill up an authorization form, we can charge their card for remaining amount, but we need to have documentation in form, both sides of CC and ID that confirms ownership of the card. 

G: I do not have time for procedures. I need to go to the airport.

ME: Well, I am afraid but I can not let you go, without bill being settled. 

G: You have put me in difficult situation.

\*Apparently my fault, he is not prepared\*

ME: I am sorry to cause you this much trouble, but it does not look like trouble is on our end. We actually asked you at check-in to follow up on the payment, as you had problems with payment already there. So now we need to find a solution.

\*At this point, he fishes some other cards, but also these are declined. We try different amounts and different currency, but TERMINAL is not happy.\* x40

It's been an hour now... Now he is calling my colleague that comes from same country as guest is. He is not willing to pay for him either. Also, what a nerve... he met him few days ago, and expect someone to settle the bill. No shame!

He calls someone 4-5 other people, perhaps a bank as well. As now he wants to try even lower amount as he thinks that he does not have enough money on the account.

TERMINAL: Approved.

But he still has an minor amount outstanding... about $30... I am so tired of him now, so i just COMP the remaining amount and let him go. 

But no no... he is not done... Now he asks me, why he is not getting text messages from his corona test. 

\*How the heck should I know?\* 

ME: Do they have correct phone number? They usually send you a test message while you are there, so they know if that line of communication is working. Did you get that message?

G: No... 

ME: you should have let them know about it. There is no other way then going there again and taking another test, this time make sure they can communicate test results back to you. 

G: No I have only $4 on my account. How do I get to the airport with that?

ME: Not sure, but perhaps train, it is much cheaper and faster than a cab ride. 

G: What about test at the airport? 

ME: Sure, there are test facilities there as well. 

G: But I need to pay... 

ME: Well, I guess you do.

\*At this point, I am considering of giving him some change for the train ticket just to get rid of him... because how dare I be responsible for him not having enough money for his expenses.\*

776,most flight crew are so entitled!,"i work front desk 7am-3pm…i’ve never had a rude guest to this day lol, mostly complaints over hot water not working, tv not working, little things that can get fixed. pilots & flight attendants are the most entitled, that not even our most “elite” member who pays more than them ,complain lol. today this flight crew came super tired. asked if they can have 4, 20oz Dasani waters for them all. i said sure, they’re 4.95 each. “Did u not hear me?! I didn’t say how much, i asked if we can have them, we always get complimentary water here” i said im sorry, we don’t do that here. (**unles you’re cool LOL) & left the waters & left to their rooms mad. another time this pilot asked if i can call a few restaurants to ask how busy they are on a friday, which i only provided phone numbers from google lol, ( still got really mad & asked to speak to my manager ) which she had my back & said “what is the issue here, cuz i don’t see one” which pissed them off! they never came back after that 😂",35,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CDEC5160>
777,"Who else gets frustrated when guests give a card for incidentals, then insist on paying at the desk for snacks, and then getting mad that their isn't a convenient receipt?","So I know this is more a problem with the design of AwnCue, but it gets seriously annoying. Corporate guests check in. Company has provided a card for the room and we get a card from the guest for incidentals. So the room has 2 receipts, one for room charges and one for incidentals. Then guest comes down to get a snack from the pantry. Ask them if they'd like to charge it to the room and they ""Oh no, I want to pay for it here"", and pull out their card. The same card they've already given me for incidentals. So I post the charges and charge the card. All pantry sales go into a single Pantry house account that includes all charges and payments for the day. Which means we can't print out the receipt for the guest, because the receipt has the last 4 digits of every card used for the Pantry that day. Guest then asks for a receipt, for expense reports or whatever. And I have to tell the guest that no, I can't really give them a receipt, unless they want me to transfer the charges back to their room on the incidentals receipt. Which them looks funny because it has a bunch of ""transferred from house account pantry..."" on every single line.  

I know its not so much the guest's fault, they expect our system to work like a gas station or a restaurant, but it gets really old. And somehow the guests that can't figure this out always seem to be ultra shiny members who travel all the time and should know already. Anybody else get frustrated by this or have some tips on how to do it better?",27,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CDEC56D0>
778,“Emotional Support Animals can’t be charged a fee - it’s federal law”,"I was peacefully minding own business when coworker calls me over for a check in. It was about changing room types on a promotional reservation because guests wanted to go from singles to two beds. 

She had been explaining the pet fee and policy to the guest before, and when I stepped it, she wrapped up that convo to tell me what’s up. 

Basically we have to charge the guest the upgrade fee and the pet fee. So coworker tells that to guest and guest (who said she had an emotional support animal) agrees to pay the fees, no groaning no moaning no complaining. 

That’s when her partner speaks up trying to show off: “you know it’s illegal to charge for an emotional support animal. That’s protected by federal law.”

I stare at him for a second before telling him that federal law prohibits a pet fee being charged to service animals. Emotional support animals are a different category, they aren’t even service animals. 

He refused to listen and probably tried to show off. “Nope, that’s illegal. What you’re doing is illegal.”

So I drop the ultimate bomb: “I mean …. I have the law in front of me …”

Let’s see who would know more about the ADA Law. 

You … who’s been staying at hotels and trying to cover an ESA as a service animal 

or Me … who’s been working at hotels and dealing with dumbasses like you.

779,NFL Team and a super shiny member. Who will win?,"So over the last few days we have been extremely busy. Friday we had 3 floors out of order because we had an NFL team staying with us and the refs stay for every home game with us. The refs aren’t actually a bad group. They come rather close to check in time, get basic rooms, add their loyalty number and then go to their room and their meeting room downstairs for their pre-game briefing. They players all get pre-registered and we have a meeting room somewhat near where they come in to pick up their keys. Players are all one one floor, support staff is on another floor, and coaches and management are all on another floor. The team also gets one entire floor with with all the conference rooms. Now we have 10 suites, 6 on one room with with coaches and management. No other guests can be on that floor. One suite is on the player floors and one suite is on a floor with support staff. 

Now with that background out of the way I had a super shiny diplomat level guest ask for an upgrade. Out of the 10 suites only 2 were even available and they were already sold. This person pitches a fit claiming they spent over $50,000 in the last year with the hotel chain. I really wanted to tell them the people taking those rooms were spending over $1,000,000 just for the night they were here. We usually get 3 NFL teams a year. 

I also had another guest who has routinely gotten a room on the top floor. The NFL team had that floor and while this guest usually always gets that room on the top floor I’m not able to put him there. He threw a fit and claimed I was rude to him because he got a room on the floor under it. He likes to be on a certain side of the building, and I was basically able to get him on that side of the building. 

I don’t care what your status is when it comes to these professional sports teams. They bring in a lot of money and I don’t want to be the one responsible for losing that contract. It’s a million dollars every time they come. They leave $100 tips for the housekeepers the next day, and our banquet staff gets a $30,000 tip to share when they leave.",84,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CDEC5460>

781,I'm checking out early.,"We all get weird questions and complaints.  Being in hotels for 25+ years - never heard this one.

This morning at 6AM a guy comes to the desk, says he is checking out early, and wanted to see if there was going to be money taken back off the bill, or does he still get charged in full, or what.

OK... no worries.  Lets take a look at what kind of reservation this is, right?  Maybe it's one of those prepaid non-cancel-able , non-refundable ones.  Maybe it's a 3rd party.  Maybe it's a points night.  Maybe it's just a regular old made-through-the-hotel-like-you-are-supposed-to reservation. Lets take a look.

Well, it's a reservation for just 1 night, direct with hotel, and he's scheduled to check out today.  No worries.  No issues.  I let him know that there would be no problem, he's not really checking out early, and the reservation was just for 1 night, and checkout time is at 11:00.

But - no..... has asking that since he was checking out at 6AM - was he going to get money back for the extra 5 hours between now and checkout time.  That is what he was asking.

""Um.. no sir, we don't prorate the room based on the number of hours you are here, and we don't charge by the hour.""

Ok so picture the scene.  I'm laying on the ground bleeding from the head, barely conscious, and my clothes are torn.  There are coins everywhere, the cash register was smashed, it was obvious what had just occurred. 

This redneck fucktard that had been staying at our hotel for like a few weeks is the first person to come on the scene.  I will NEVER forget this.

783,SO it's our fault you can't read a map??,"Once upon a time it was a normal day at the airport suddenly I get a call from the airport staff that there is a guest who claims has a reservation for our hotel and transportation.

So it's protocol to check the sistem to verify the information, I'm  not seeing her name on arrivals for that day. Giving her the benefit of doubt I also check the arrivals for our other hotels from the same company but nothing.

Please note that while I was checking this lady is now yelling at the poor airport staff, suddenly I think I know where her reservation might be and was seriously hopping it wasn't.

So I call our other hotel and as they verify they confirm that her reservation was for that specific hotel. Turns out she had set up her reservation but it was for the other side of the country. We moved her reservation to one of the locations of the state we were in, as soon as she arrives she goes straight to the front desk to scream at everybody how this was our fault for not checking her flight.

784,"Manson-esque Dude Threatens Manager, Another Tells Me To Kiss Him","Hey good folks of the front desk!

Not too long after I first began my night audit journey, I posted about something that happened at the hotel, and I was *blown away* by the support and kind words. It really helped me out, and I wanted to give a bit of an update!

I wish I could say that like good ol' Geralt from *the Witcher*, I've been battling the weird beasties we folks deal with, and that I've emerged tougher and triumphant- (Well, I feel I *have* gotten a little tougher, a little better about speaking up and being firm with boundaries)

But *man.* The pep in my step is startin' to turn into a **limp** and- like a half-deflated balloon- I've started to be a little bummed about my night audit adventures.

The turning point happened recently, when a particular man was staying with us.

He seemed like a perfectly nice fella, though his wife began to frequently call and when I'd transfer her call to his room.... *he wouldn't answer.*

This happened **several** times. As in, I would say a silent mantra of hope every time I'd transfer her-

***""Oh Lawdy please let this dude answer. Please, please, please.""***

No luck, and every time I spoke to her she became more and more irate, as though I was purposely keeping him from being on the phone- ""What is going on?!""- and, when I offered the excuse that we were having phone issues or that maybe he wasn't in the room-

""He should be. That makes NO sense whatsoever. This is ridiculous.""

I'm 99% sure he was avoiding her calls.

He started to come down and talk with me, at the desk, seeming nothing more than what I *thought* was fatherly and kind- he did mention at one point that he was dealing with a difficult divorce, and then said,

""It's nice to talk with someone with a little light in their heart-""Which, at the time, I just read as a very nice, appreciative compliment.

\~

Well, as my grandpa would say, ***""Hell's bells and shotgun shells.""***

Things quickly changed, after that.

I have a coworker who told me she'd seen him with alcohol, and that she would hear him yelling in his room, either at someone or just to himself.

My first thought was, *""Um...and nobody is concerned about this...?""*

Then, one night he was walking through the lobby, face flushed and beer in hand; I had the idea that maybe he'd been drinking for a while, that evening.

He seemed to want to say something to me, but I had to help several other guests. He sat on the lobby couch. At this point, I started to feel a little nervous.

After the other guests head to their respective rooms, he gets up and says, ""You know what-"" And writes something down on a piece of paper before sliding it across the desk:His number.

I tried to be nice (Which I realize is my bad habit. I've learned that I *have* to be direct and firm in these instances; no way around it) and said, ""Oh, thank you- that's very sweet- but there's a rule against fraternization."" -Time to make something up, I decided- ""-And I have a very sweet boyfriend I just started dating-""

""You're just saying that,"" He says, as though reading my mind, ""Come on. Well, if you change your mind..."" -And with that he heads up to his room.

\-But not for long. NEXT, he calls the front desk.

""Tabs, I'm serious. Give me a call. I like you. I like your energy.""

*Oh hell.*

I tell him that's very kind of him but that it would break (My completely made up) boyfriend's heart.

Even worse? After I get off the phone with this man, guess what? HE COMES DOWN TO THE LOBBY AGAIN.

I happened to be on the phone with another hotel at that moment, and when I got off the phone he says, ""You getting me in trouble?"" (His first thought was that I'd called the police)

""N-no."" I start to get VERY nervous at this point, and I realized something even more concerning. He was standing there looking up and around. Looking for the *cameras.*

""We gonna do this here or step outside?""

""I'm sorry?""

""You gotta kiss me, otherwise how will you know we're not compatible?""

I'm sure my fear started to show on my face because THEN he has the audacity to say,

""Oh don't look at me like that...c'mon...""

I get *brutally* honest with the man (But kept my voice gentle) and said, ""I think you are going through a very hard time right now, and you're latching on to someone who is being kind to you because of that. You've had a lot more life experience than me- believe me- and it would be inappropriate in more ways than one. I don't *want* to kiss you. I don't want to, and you're scaring me a little."" I watched his face and he wouldn't look at me for several moments as though ashamed,

Then this dude goes, ""Sorry, I'm sorry."" And hurries to his room. It was incredibly awkward but in the moment I was glad he at least apologized.

When I told my manager all of this the next day and her response was just, ""I'm sorry that happened. Don't worry about taking the trash out to the dumpster when it's still dark. Just try to avoid him.""

I was like:

*That's it???*

*What in the flying frag grenade?*

I realized then that I wanted to find something different, job-wise.

Then came another incident, in which a man who wasn't a guest kept coming in. When my manager confronted him, he said,

""I'd hate to see what's happening on the news to happen here, too.""-And when she looked at the television, the report being covered was that of a murder.No police were called. But she told us to be aware that the man wasn't allowed walking around the lobby as he had been, and told us to inform him that he needed to leave, if we saw him.

I did have to tell him to leave, at one point. He'd been sitting in the dark. Just sitting. I was alarmed as all get out and my heart has *never* reacted with such automatic fear to someone, before. Dude looked honestly a bit like Charles Manson. 

""I understand, dear."" Was all he said to me. At least he didn't yell, but it was almost more eerie that he was so calm and polite, especially knowing what he'd said to my manager.

A few days later, the police *did* have to be called with this individual. He came in asking to use the phone and when told to leave, threatened the manager on duty again.

\~

*Whooo*. Dang, folks, sorry that was so long winded!!

Basically, it's been *long* journey. I definitely don't regret my time there, though, and there've been way more good moments than bad. If I hadn't gotten another job offer somewhere else with more pay, I'd probably still consider staying!

Then again, the way that management handled the situations above makes me question if it's really the best workplace, anyhow.

*Thank you* all for letting me vent!! This has been really cathartic and I honestly love this group (And I'm gonna keep reading the posts, on here!)

Edited to add:

Main manager was *very* upset with me for turning in my two weeks' notice. She told me that I needed to give her a *month* instead, to find someone new. (I hate that I'm disappointing her because I look up to the woman, but *dang.* A month seems...excessive.)  


I spoke with a friend about this and she told me, ""Tabs, time to use that God-given backbone and put your foot down; she's taking advantage.""

(I don't like to think that of the manager in question, but it does feel that way.)",12,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CDEC5FD0>
785,Wetback!!!! wrong kinda brown LADY!,"So this happened last night, over the course of a busy night shift, where I am educating adults on how a TV remote works, to how an air conditioner must be set to ""cool"" so that it can cool a room, I meet Mrs. Purple (had purple shoes on), middle aged Caucasian woman with a voice that sounds like cigarettes arent the only things she smokes......

So I am a single night shift auditor at a small motel, we have about 30 rooms, but we get hella busy on weekends due to us doing hourly and nightly rooms, on saturday nights, it is a different breed of people I am dealing with like I said earlier teaching people how to use a fucking remote control or calls from rooms telling me their AC is not working, come to find out they have it on fan and not on cool......Fam like???? does common sense not exist anymore. Mrs Purple walks in towards the end of my night around 4 am, at this point I am sold out of all my rooms, she asks to get a room and wants to check out on monday, I tell her ""sorry Ma'am I am currently sold out of all my rooms and wont have anymore ready until the next morning"" After simply saying just this one sentence she is already enraged, ""I have been to a million hotels and everyone is sold out, your parking lot is not even full, give me a room, I know you have one, I can see it online"" ""Well Ma'am if you look closer to the online site the room available is for check-in today at 3pm, it is currently 4am, we wont have that room ready until then"" She then proceeds to continue to yell and shout about how horrible hotels are and storms out the front door, she gets in her car and I am like thank god at least she is leaving. Big mistake on my part cursing myself, she see's a room door that has been left open, comes back in and demands me to rent her that room, she asks if there is anyone in that room and I tell her that it is dirty and wont be cleaned until the morning. She demands that I clean that room and rent it to her, this is where I start to raise my voice a little because I am done dealing with her bullshit, I tell her there is no one here who can clean it and I have no room for her and she must leave. She starts yelling racial slurs and calls me a wetback, says that wetbacks are meant to work as cleaners and I should be a good wetback and clean the room for her. I kindly correct her and say I am not hispanic, I am Indian (I do look hispanic though) so wrong kinda brown lady, after she realizes that her entitlement is not going to get her anywhere with me, she finally leaves, but just before driving off, she must have had a mcdonalds cup in her car with water and ice, she chucks that at my window and speeds off.  

Like where and who were you raised by where you think it is appropriate for you to say such things to people? People like this are just so frustrating!",38,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CDEC5A60>
786,"What will harassing the Night Auditor get you? Banned from the property, that's what.","It's been a rough weekend. I work night audit in a pretty busy location. With only 108 rooms we stay pretty booked up, especially on weekends. But despite the fire fighters being called out to property, a desk agent that takes it upon herself to switch out room types of reservations without telling anyone, and two weddings, a big Christmas party and a soccer team, tonight was the worst. 

I've worked in hotels for six years now, and this level of crazy (and . . . I'm not even sure what the right word for it is? Immaturity, maybe.) Has left me stumped. 

We had two no shows last night, and I don't *have* to sell those rooms to walk ins after audit, but because our sale manager is on our ass about shit like that, it looks good to sell them. But, as many of you may know, the type of people who come in as walk ins with no reservation at 3am are sometimes hit or miss when it comes to how they're going to act. 

The man walks in, and through my mask I could already smell the weed. But, hey, maybe he just smokes in his car. Is it a red flag? Maybe, but *sales,sales,sales* right? He asks the price and I tell him I'd have to charge him last nights rate, but then I adjusted it to be a few dollars less, our going rate being $159, and the rate I gave him $145. The total after taxes being $158.07. So I tell him and then I informed him that after the deposit it'll be $208.07. Immediately he stands up straighter, and starts to raise his voice. 

Man: Why the *FUCK* would you charge me $200 when you *just* said it was $158? That's a big difference! You can't just start adding money onto what I have to pay!

Me: So, the extra fifty is our security deposit that we-

Man: Oh, I see. You want to charge me more because I'm black! Well I'm not going to pay that! That's fucking ridiculous! 

Our manager is an angel, and she respects our limits. We don't have to tolerate guests (or in his case, not-guests) raising their voice or cursing at us. So, I kindly tell him to leave. I didn't want things to escalate, and having a guest here trying to bully me out of paying the mandatory security deposit by calling me a racist wasn't going to make for a good guest. 

*He starts to come around the desk,* but then turns last minute and walk right out the door instead. I watch my cameras and see him send in his girlfriend. *Great.*

So, I am pleasant with her, and explain because her boyfriend decided to cause a scene that he wasn't welcome on the property tonight. 

Girlfriend: What does that have to do with me?

Me: You came in the same car. If you stay, so would he. And, as I've said he isn't welcome here because he started to yell at me when he came in. 

Girlfriend: No. See, what *I* think is going on here is you're just a fucking racist bitch. 

Me: *Okay* and ma'am you can leave too. I'm not renting you a room tonight. 

Girlfriend: Okay I need your name

Me: *first name*

Girlfriend: Your name

Me: *first name?*

Girlfriend: No your first and last name.

Me: No. My name is *first name.* It's on my nametag, see.

Girlfriend: No. I need your last name.

Me: You don't. I'm the only one with my name who works here. 

Girlfriend: Okay ""Just *first name""* I am going to contact your manager and I am going to get you fired.

Me: Okay. We'll she'll be in tomorrow you can call her then.

Girlfriend: No. You're going to call her now.

Me: No I'm not. It's 3:20 in the morning. She'll be in in the morning. That's when she'll be able to help you out.

She won't leave. She keeps going back and forth with me, and she actually comes behind the desk. So, I grab my phone and tell her I'm calling the police. She then decided to leave, but said she would just make a reservation online.  

But that didn't stop her. She kept calling, even after I had the police speak to her because she called in while they were there. (The station is literally in a stones throw distance, so they were there fast.)

One time pretending to be someone wanting to book a room, and I told her that unfortunately it was too late to book a room now, check in wasn't until 3pm. 

Girlfriend: Actually. I am a (3rd tier) member and I am entitled to an early check in. 

Me, pretending to not know who she was: Yes. If there's rooms of your type available you can check in two hours early which would be 1pm. 

Girlfriend: *Actuuuuuualllllllyyyyyy,* I can check in at 4 am.

(Conveniently 5 minutes from then) 

All in all she called a total of six times. Sometimes she would pretend to be someone else, but she would always break character.

The final call was my all time favorite. It was just her saying the same insult over and over again. ""You're incompetent"" and then the final blow: ""You're just a retard then"" (I feel icky even typing that out.)""

I ended up having to call my manager because it went on like this for an hour. I couldn't do anything with the phone ringing every ten minutes, and nothing could be done. They even called while I was on the phone with her. The girlfriend gave me her information, so I was able to look up her profile. And she was a lower tier than what she said, and she'd stayed at our brand a very low number of times, so I think she might have been an employee. She knew all the right wording and information. Either that or she was a habitual complainer to get enough points to raise ranks.",31,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CDEC5670>
787,On guest’s second visit to hotel we were to act like we never met him,"This happened while I work front desk at a hotel in the Caribbean. On the first visit, the guest older white male guest brought a woman we all assumed was his girlfriend. He stayed 2 weeks and was very pleasant. Then shortly after we were told he’d be back for another visit. We were not to acknowledge that he’d been there before. We were not to say “Welcome back Mr. X”. 

Mr. X needs to be treated like a new guest. We found this odd but whatever. When he showed up, we realized why. The woman he came in with was not the same as before. This one was his wife.

789,"Cheaters get caught by their spouses, in this episode of ""Never a Dull Day""","So my morning started off with a bang. As the NA left he mentioned a couple that he'd checked into 2XX 45 minutes prior and had them pay the early check in fee, but that was all the excitement of his shift. Let's call him Jimbo.

About 45 minutes later a woman called and asked if Jimbo was staying with us. I told her that I wouldn't be able to give that sort of information out, and would not be checking to see if that person was staying with us. She assured me it was fine, Jimbo is her husband. I assured her it was not fine, and regardless of a relation to a possible guest, we do not even confirm if someone is staying at the hotel or not. She said fine, I'll just come down there. I hoped she wouldn't.

About twenty minutes later my hopes were crushed. She showed up with another man, and they insisted they knew he was at the hotel because his car was there. I told them I couldn't help them, there was no information that I could give them. Both of them were extremely frustrated that I wouldn't help. They insisted it was an emergency, and I told them if there was an emergency they needed to call the police.

So they called the police. The officer who showed up has featured in a number of my stories so I'm pretty familiar with him. He talks it over with them, and points out this is not a police matter. Also, it turns out these are the respective spouses of the cheating couple. The jilted husband, we'll call him JH, then decides to insist that there is no way his wife would have gone willingly. She was obviously drunk and being taken advantage of.

None of us believe him, but the officer wants to watch security footage of the check in and the paramours heading to their room to confirm that neither of them were under duress. The jilted spouses tried to watch the footage, but the officer told them off. Watching the security footage the lady was maaaaaaaybe tipsy, but certainly there of her own free will. The officer asked me to try contacting the room saying a welfare check had been called in, but to no one's surprise they didn't answer so we left it at that.

He offered to tell the folks to leave for me, and said he'd hang around until they were gone. The jilted wife (JW) left in a van, but JH hung around for a bit and told the officer his car battery was dead. The officer told him he still needed to leave, and could not wait for a ride on the property. At first he seemed resolute to toe the line and stand literally on the edge of the four lane highway outside which is obviously public property, but after a moment of that he joined JW whose van we spotted parked at the gas station across the way.

After the officer left, the HHK and I joked around saying the jilted spouses should just get together then everyone will be happy. It's not like we felt great covering for a cheating couple, but it's also super not our business. We wondered at how long they would wait over there considering they also had at least one child with them.

We did not have to wait terribly long to find out. Maybe 20-30 minutes later, the cheaters left their room. As the cheaters got close to their car it became clear to us their spouses had spotted them, but the couple seemed to be blissfully unaware. The van peeled off down the road to be able to make a u-turn to get back to us, while JH sprinted across four lanes of traffic. Once he got over he pulled the car door open to scream at his wife as the van pulled into the parking lot. JW got out and ran to the driver's side to slap and scream at her husband.

I was concerned that things might become increasingly violent, so I called the police back before somebody got more than their ego hurt. While I was still on the phone, JW ran back to the van and honestly for a moment I thought she was going to ram her husband's car with the van. But instead she backed out and drove off. Meanwhile, JH was trying to coax his wife out of the car or something.

The police showed up and quickly diffused the remaining situation and cheating wife (CW) got out of the car. An officer took each half of the couple aside to confirm the situation with them. A friend or brother of one half of the couple also showed up to confront CW, so she was just not having a great day. I did not feel too bad for her. Cheating husband was allowed to leave to go get his comeuppance at home with his wife I assume.

Ultimately JH and CW seemed to leave together. I say seemed, because about a half an hour later JH was back at the desk, no wife in sight. It turns out his car was still dead, and he needed a jump. I felt for the guy even though he'd been a pain in my butt for the morning. I also just so happened to be parked directly next to him, and have jumper cables. So I went out and jumped the guy's car for him. He thanked me for my help and told me to have a good day and I said you too without thinking. Pretty sure the chance of this guy's day turning around is slim to none.",46,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CDEC5850>
790,Thank you wonderful people,"I made reservations on line yesterday for the end of December for one night in another state. Today I wake up and see the reservation was actually made for the same day. I call the corporate number. I was put down as “no show” and billed for the room. Im a teacher. A loss of $250 is huge for me. I decide to call the hotel directly and I talk to a lovely woman at the property. I explain what happened and ask her if she can maybe just give me a discount for the new reservation I now need to make. She says, oh, at that new date the room is $399 for a night. I start to cry. Im having a huge surgery that might kill me and this is a last trip before I either die or am sick recovering for at least a year! The woman comps me the room! I cried so hard.

791,No I will NOT let you do that!,"Just happened,  on mobile, etc.

Being our slow time, our current rate for a single queen room for one adult is $79.99. Up to one kids can go in there too for no extra charge, but any more people will require a second bed, and obviously any additional adults will raise the cost.

Guy with supposedly limited English ability comes into my hotel and asks for one bed for one person. He specifically said ""one bed for one person"", so I start the process, and get him through the entire check in. Of course now he pulls out cash so I have him do an imprint on a card, which he is very resistant to, but I have a bad feeling, so I insist. Total with tax $87.83. After getting the imprint, and making his change, I get him his key, and he starts asking if the main doors are the only way into the hotel (another red flag to me), so I tell him no, all others doors just require a room key to open. He then heads out to his car, and I step back into the back to watch my monitors. 

About 10 minutes later, he, his baby momma, and a passel of kids start to head in, through the main door even. So I stop them at the door, and I let him know that this is too, many people for a single room, and I would have to move him into a bigger room. He asked if it will cost more, and I reply yes. He immediately demands his $100 bill back. I say sure, we can cancel the room,  I will need the $12.17 change back. He was stunned I needed the change back before I would give him the C note back. Even more shocking to him was when I told him to surrender the key to me as well.

Needless to say he left pissed, but he left.",46,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CDEC5790>
792,Karma is a MF,"So I work at a popular chain hotel on weekends as a night auditor and because of my background, I double as security when our officers are either occupied or not present.

For the last few months, our security has had issues with a security patrol vehicle not associated with the hotel who will constantly park in the handicapped parking spaces. We have numerous complaints from guests that security is taking up the handicap spaces which, in turn, is making out security officers look bad. The security supervisor and other officers have confronted this individual on numerous occasions and he has refused to heed their requests. We later discovered he does patrols in the area but often stays at our hotel.

2 weeks ago at about 12AM, our security was busy with the lounge, so I did a quick sweep of our parking area and noticed the security patrol vehicle had just arrived on property and entered one of the handicapped spaces. I eyed his vehicle for a handicap placard and waited until he exited his vehicle to determine if he had a limp or otherwise required the accommodation. I then made contact with him and engaged him in conversation.

Me: How’s your night going?

Him: Good

Me: So, unfortunately you can’t use the handicapped space without a placard.

Him: What’s your name?

Me: Arcanisia

Him: I’m a diamond member

Me: We appreciate your loyalty, but that doesn’t give you the right to break the law. Can you please move your car to a regular space

Him: You’re doing a good job you know that?

He then enters the hotel and I notify the security supervisor of what occurred. I later follow up with my FD who knows the guest’s identity and we look him in the system. Turns out he’s only a GOLD member, which is our lowest tier so he’s also a liar.

At this time, I’m tempted to call the number on the side of his patrol car, but I decide to wait as the FD suggests we inform the manager so he can talk to him and threaten to put him on the DNR.

Last week I’m doing my patrol and notice he’s once again in the handicap space despite being literally next to an open regular space. I leave and return 3 hours later and he’s still there so I call the number and inform them of the situation. 20 minutes later, his car is moved to a regular space.

I came into work today and the security supervisor informs me he saw the patrol officer yesterday without his patrol vehicle and not in uniform pending his suspension. The supervisor stated he was surprised I’d called the company and thought we should wait it out. The main thing that got to me was his attitude and lack of regard for those needing accommodations. Had he come to me and said something along the lines of, “Hey man, I just finished my shift and I just want to knock out for a few hours. Can you offer me some professional courtesy,” I’d be more inclined to help him out, but as they say, karma is a MF.


Tldr: Security patrol driver not associated with the hotel continually parked in handicapped spaces despite numerous warnings and pleas from hotel security and staff. I complained to his company and they suspended him.

Edit: when I said “professional courtesy,” I meant that I’d let him park at the front drive if it was only going to be a few hours and not in the Accessible spot.

Update: I spoke to the security supervisor and I found a few things regarding this incident.

1)The patrol officer was already on suspension for a previous mess up.

2)His supervisors were confused why was he at a hotel when he was supposed to be actively patrolling a location on the other side of town. @TellThemISaidHi was correct",41,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CDEC5040>
793,Say a prayer,"We have had a guest staying at the hotel since January 2020. She is a cancer patient at the local hospital. She is in the middle of a very nasty divorce. She has tried her hardest to find an apartment but there is nothing in town that is within her price range. She is an overall sweet woman. Her son is with her and he also has a brain tumor. She has a nurse come and help her out with appointments and what not. I developed a close bond with her especially because she was one of our only guests for a while.

Today, she got taken out in an ambulance. She was screaming so loud in pain. She told me earlier this week that the cancer had spread and the doctor's don't know how much longer she has. I hope to see her at least one more time before she goes.

Please keep this woman in your thoughts and prayers.

\-Wedding party in the lobby after midnight being obnoxiously loud.

\-Wedding party almost threw a whole roll of toilet paper in the pool. Their aim was off when throwing it over the fence. This was after telling them they could not go swimming at 2am. They also called me a party pooper.

\-Shiny member yelling at me because his room was not cleaned. Per covid polivy we only clean it after the third day

\-After getting barely any sleep, the Front Desk Supervisor waking me up by calling me and telling me that the newest front desk person is screwing up royally.

Mind you, there are two Super Charging stations within 5 miles of the hotel. Guest demanded her stay comped because she can’t make it home to Santa Barbara. 

I reminded her of the Super Chargers and the procedures we follow when we’re full. She wanted nothing to do with the explanation and demanded a refund. Of course we denied and now she’s going crazy at the desk. I might have also told her this is a first world problem and the hotel is not responsible or charging your vehicle.

796,Guest calls 911 to report a dead women in his room twice and cops ask me to do my job better,"As soon as I got on shift the FD was dealing with a drunken lady who would not leave the property. I clocked in and went to help and asked her to leave our property. She wasn't a guest and was banging on random doors looking for her uncle. She was belligerently incoherent (I could make out her swear words but normal words and sentences was just a garbled mess) so I called PD for assistance and she wandered off the property by the time they arrived. I gave them a description and advised them she was heavily intoxicated and needed to be taken to the sobering center.

About an hour later she walks back on property banging on doors again so I called PD. There is an unrelated guest staying here checking out tomorrow that has been a pain in the ass as well. He's an older gentleman who also has been having one too many and was already DNRd due to his behavior. I watched on camera as he exited his room and headed towards the drunken lady and of course they end up going into his room which is a problem. Their combined drunken power may be too much for our other guests let alone the room to handle.

I advise the cops of what occurred earlier with the drunken lady and we would like her removed and taken to the sobering center. The cop went to the room and for whatever reason decided to leave her in the room and left.

A few hours later I hear someone pounding on our night window and its the drunken grandpa. He tells me his ""girlfriend"" he just met a few hours ago is dead. I'm thinking to myself if only the police took her away when I asked as I call 911. Dispatch told me to go to the room to see if she is breathing and not going to lie I got within a foot of her and she legitimately looked dead and wasn't breathing. They told me to put her on the floor and I wasn't going to touch her so I told the grandpa to do it. As he was hoisting her up she opened her eyes and the grandpa gasped in horror as she fell back onto the bed. So she wasn't dead after all and soon after PD and the first responders showed up.

I again updated the police about what happened earlier and asked them to take the lady to the sobering center and they **did not again**. I am really annoyed at this point because I know the drunken duo are going to continue to be trouble. Not 30 minutes later I get a frantic call from another guest that another guest asked to use her phone to report a dead person in his room. She tells me I need to call 911 because they want to speak with me. I call them and they instruct me to head to the room.

I get there and not only is she not dead she's sitting up taking shots from a vodka bottle and asks me if I'm security and to get the F out of her room. I ignore her and unloaded a bit on dispatch saying I've been calling throughout the day specifically to get the drunken lady taken to the drunk tank because she's not a guest and she will continue to cause issues. I ask her to have the officers remove them both.

So the cops arrive and they tell me this is the 2nd frivolous 911 call tonight and ask me to screen our guests more carefully if possible. I told him we turn away visibly intoxicated guests and the grandpa wasn't drunk when he checked in. I also told him I've been calling them multiple time throughout the day trying to get the drunken lady to the sobering center and that several other cops showed up and didn't take her in. He just said yada yada yada be more mindful of our policies and turn away problem guests. I felt like saying if you all did your jobs earlier this wouldn't have happened.

We're not clairvoyants if a guest looks fine at check in there's no way for us to predict the future and know they're going to end up being stupid later. I always turn away people who are sketch or visibly drunk or high. I once had a Methany attempt to insert her card into our card reader for a full on minute and failed. Obviously I didn't rent to her.

I'm sick of this property lol and am seriously considering leaving (again). My family is headed to other relatives for Christmas and I have a few days to decide whether or not to turn in my notice so I can join them.

797,I hate having Kevins as Security,"Just to set the stage, I'm the Audit Supervisor in a hotel in the downtown area in a major city. While we are a business hotel we're located near a lot of bars and clubs so we get a lot of chaos at night. Especially on weekends. So we have a hired security that comes on property 5 nights a week and stays the full night.

Because of how crazy our property can get, our exterior doors are set to AUTO so that people can go in and out freely, they all lead into a vestibule that has a second set of doors that are set to ONE-WAY meaning that they can only go from the inside of the building out. Someone on the outside of these doors must use their keycard or hit the buzzer to speak with a desk agent. We have it this way so that desk agents control who comes in and out and security can watch the doors and walk the perimeter so they can see in the blind spots of the cameras.

An hour or so after our bar closed for the night and the part-time bartender went home, our full-time bartender stopped in with some friends. She said they were out for the night and felt like ordering a pizza and popping in to say hi. I said sure and they parked themselves off to the side. When I buzzed the pizza guy in through the south entrance, a crowd of guests came in the north entrance and some guy followed in behind them and went straight for our market area.

He started digging through stuff and grabbed some chips and came to me saying to charge them to his room. I asked for the room number and he told me ""43 or uh...maybe 47"" ...what? ""Um, sir, what's your last name?"" He gives me his last name and it doesn't come up in my system. I try a few different spelling variations and nothing. I even went so far as to search the first initial ""P"" and there were only 3 names that popped up in-house and not a single one was close to his. ""Sir, if you can't give me room number and last name I need to take cash or a card."" He tried to argue to just put it to the room and I stood my ground, ""Cash or card"".

He started going through his pockets and pulls out a stack of cards but doesn't bother going through them. He keeps muttering that his sister has all his money and he doesn't have cash. I told him I could take credit or debit and he hands me two Visa Gift Cards. Both decline. He then digs through his pockets again until a couple comes to the doors. They buzz me, I ask for room number/last name and they confirmed they're guests. I let them in and they come to get new keys.

The man tries to step out of the way so that I can take care of the guests. I tell him that I have to ring him up first, he tells me to take care of the guests. We go back and forth with this for a moment before the guest just offers to pay for the chips. I begrudgingly take the card from the guest and start to close out the transaction.

Remember how I let the pizza guy in? Well, he actually dropped off two orders. 1 for my bartender and 1 for a guest who hadn't come down yet. This is common and the delivery guys know to just leave it at the desk with me. Most people won't touch it or will ask if it's theirs before they do. The chips guy didn't. He just started lifting the lid to look at the food. I snapped and told him to stop and to get out. He tried to argue that he was checking to see if the pizza was his. I told him I knew the order wasn't his, that he isn't a guest here and that he needs to leave now. He tried to argue more with me but I just kept telling him to get out until he finally did.

The guest apologized to me for getting involved and I told them to not worry, I wasn't going to charge them for the chips, and for them having to be caught up in that situation I let them take two waters for free from the market. They again apologized to me and asked if this was a regular thing. I took a deep breath and smiled, ""Unfortunately, it is downtown...and a Friday night."" The guests seemed to understand but still felt bad, I sighed and nodded over their shoulder while whispering, ""I'm honestly more upset that my security is still on TikTok.""

The guests look over and, you guessed it, my security officer is sitting there, not even 6ft from us, eyeballs deep in his phone. He not once looked up to see what was going on with the chips guy!

The guests walked off to the elevators and as soon as I saw them step on and I made sure no one else was around, I got his attention, ""Kevin! ...KEVIN!"" He slowly looked away from his phone with a half-smile/half laugh on his face, I threw my arms up and just stared him down. ""DUDE! What the fuck?!"" He was so confused and I just unloaded on him with everything he just missed out on. He was so shocked that he shot up, threw his phone in a drawer behind the desk, and profusely apologized to me for being distracted.

My bartender sat further away than Kevin did and she and her friends heard and saw everything! How the hell did he not?! He started rambling about how he'll do better and I just watch cameras to see if Chip guy actually left.

Nope.

I spotted something moving just on the edge of the camera view on the north vestibule, I glance up and I see him standing there. He never actually left. He walked on the other side of the one-way door and hid off camera. I pointed him out and told Kevin to make him leave, do not let him in! Kevin walked right up to the doors to where they would open, stood in the open doorway, and told this guy to leave. Chip guy got in his face and started berating him, saying he was a guest and an officer and didn't deserve to be treated this way. Kevin was startled, backed up, and let the guy in the building! Kevin looked at me confused and I shot him an angry look and shook my head, Kevin then puffed up and got back in the guy's face demanding ID. Chip guy said he didn't have to and that he wanted his pizza. That's when I started shouting for him to get out again. Kevin then cut me off and told me to call the police. I knew nothing else was going to be done so I did.

While I'm on the phone with 911 Kevin is still keeping the guy from going any further in the lobby, I'm shaking from anger, anxiety, and stress at this point and am skipping over my own words so 911 is having to ask me to repeat myself over and over. I eventually give a description of the guy and our address and as soon as I'm off the phone with 911 chip guy decides to finally leave on his own.

While we're waiting on the police to arrive, someone inside the club right across the street somehow snuck a gun into the building and started firing. Police were obviously more focused on that than our chip thief so they never came.

I told Kevin to get the pizza to the guest room and then start doing a perimeter check to be sure that Chip guy was actually gone this time. I watched cameras and made sure he actually left the building this time. I kept my eyes on the cameras until I got a phone call, it was the pizza delivery guy. Turns out the pizza that chip guy tried to steal was meant for another hotel with the same name! He was calling to tell us whoever wanted the pizza could just have it. While I'm trying not to scream out loud I catch on camera, you guessed it, Chip guy!

He somehow snuck around the property under and off camera and into the south vestibule and waited, again off-camera, until a crowd of people came in. He tried to hide behind them until he was at the market, I immediately put down the phone and shouted at him to get out again. He walked in grabbed chips rolled his eyes at me and said ""What are you gonna do about it? You already called the cops, tell them I took shit too while you're at it."" then strolled out.

Where was Kevin? He had just started his perimeter check and caught chip guy as he was walking out of the building. Kevin just stood there yelling at him to not come back. Chip guy just kept walking and flipped Kevin off.

Kevin tried to come in and write up an incident report, he didn't know how to fill one out and didn't know what to put. I had already been writing one as the events occurred, with time stamps and camera numbers, and just copy and pasted what I had typed and told Kevin I could email it to him and he could edit it to be from his perspective with his information. He said no and for me to just print it out. I did and he just crossed out his name in parts and wrote mine instead. So where mine said that ""I then watched cameras while Kevin did a perimeter check."" It said that Kevin sat at the desk with the cameras while I did the perimeter check. He then signed it!

For the next 3 hours, Kevin refused to leave the front desk. He went into our back office, grabbed a chair, and sat down right beside me and watched cameras, buzzed people in, and was directly in my way when I was trying to do the audit. Multiple times I had to tell him to get up and go take care of people hiding in the vestibules because instead of him actually watching the cameras he was back on his phone or was talking to me about whatever popped in his head.

I remained silent until I finished the audit and then took a long trip to the ladies' room, then took even longer making the coffee for the lobby. I just needed to be away from him for a while. My head was splitting open from the stress headache. I come back to the desk and realize he has 15 minutes left of his shift. He looks up at me with puppy eyes and before he even asks I just groan and tell him he can go. 15 minutes isn't 2hrs and at this point, he's proven he's utterly useless anyway.

He then tells me he's excited to work with me again tonight! I'm so considering calling out...

Update: I was too stressed and irritated to bother typing an complaint to my bosses about Kevin and decided to give him one more night. BIG MISTAKE! There was another incident, while not as bad as Chip Guy I did come close to losing my temper. I flat out told Kevin to leave property, do not come back, and that I was reporting him to his managers and mine. I did just that and my email was actually forwarded to the CEO of the security company! The CEO heavily apologized to us and my manager may have hinted that we may be searching for other companies to contract with. Thankfully the guy from last night was good, quiet, but did his job really well. ",11,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CDEC5220>
798,"Saying ""Happy Anniversary"" to guest got his whole stay comped.","Last week I was talking to a gent about his 25th Anniversary and how he could celebrate it when he came in that day. He wanted rose petals, champagne, chocolate strawberries etc. No problem, he was gonna pay for them so whatever. I asked him if he needed flowers too, but he declined as he stated he brought her 25 long stem red roses that morning.

I put a note on his reservation to say ""Happy Anniversary"" at check in. I leave for the day and get a work WhatsApp to make sure we follow all protocol in notes or take copious notes and put them in the profile. Apparently when the evening FD agent checked them in and wished a ""Happy Anniversary,"" he grew irate, asked to speak to a manager and blamed us for ruining his surprise. He lied and said this was supposed to be a surprise, but he NEVER told me this was a surprise.

The agent working was a supervisor and explained there were no managers available in the building at the time.

Except our GM. Who was working late.

I don't know how it escalated to a GM issue, but this guy was incessant about placing the blame on someone. The GM talked to him and when I walked in the next am, ""all charges comped"" on his folio.

Because we wished him a Happy Anniversary.

On his Anniversary.

At the hotel he was spending his Anniversary.",114,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CDEC5E20>

upon working the AM shift, had a guest come in the morning 8am or so, and buy a water and a sprite from our suiteshop. i added charges to the room and guest left,

guest: you dont remember him coming to extend the room?!!!

Me: yes i remmember him, he came to buy a water and a sprite and charge it to the room, but ma'am he never extended the night, however if that what you want, that's no problem i will just need for you insert cc for payment.

guest: i want the MANAGER!! \*Slapping hand on the counter multiple times\*

800,"Sir, this is a Milton","For context, on our nightly MOD report last night it was noted that there was a guest that wasn't getting any hot water in their sink (shower was OK) and that we should get it fixed in the morning, but also that he would probably stop by for compensation. Well, guess who just sauntered over to the desk.

Guest: I expect to be compensated for this issue.

Me, opening up the bargaining: We'd like to offer you 2,000 bonus points.

Guest: No, I prefer cash. This happened to me when I was on a \[redacted\] cruise and they moved me rooms and gave me $200 cash.

Me: Well, sir, we aren't a cruise line where you're paying thousands of dollars to stay with us this weekend. You're barely paying above $200 after taxes with your group rate. A free weekend is excessive in light of that. I can take $10 off your rate for last night along with the points.

Guest: \*still visibly frustrated\* I guess that makes sense.

&#x200B;

In what world is it ok to ask for me to just hand over $200 for a pretty minor issue that was easily fixed the next morning, especially when you're in a completely different environment from a cruise line?",12,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CEF7FD60>
801,"Real Life Princess demands lots of things, including illegally. Gets nothing.","Well, she must think she's royalty to fucking talk to me like she does. It's 4am and this guest calls. When I answer, she talks over my greeting and demands I send up robes and slippers. We do not, nor have we ever, had robes and slippers. I inform her that. ""But you promised robes and slippers when I made my reservation."" I double check her res. She booked third party. God damn it. I fucking hate OTA's. They're constantly getting shit wrong and one specific OTA loves lying to people about services we have and sends the heat onto us. (Fuck you, Pagonda.) ""I'm sorry, but it looks like you booked through an online travel agency. They must have misinformed you about our services. Unfortunately, we don't have any direct control over what third parties advertise but we will follow up with them for corrections on their website."" She demands robes and slippers another four times, ignoring me when I say we literally have none. What finally got through to her was ""I'm sorry, I don't know what to tell you. Your third party misinformed you about what we have. I literally do not have any robes or slippers to give you."" I figured when she sighed that was the end of it. Nah. Of course not.

She demanded free food, delivered to her room. ""We do not have room service, and our kitchen opens up for breakfast service at 7am"". She demands an apple and some sandwiches be brought up to her room. I reiterate. ""No, I'm sorry I can't do that. We do not offer any room service, and our kitchen is closed."" I tell her we have a snack market she can buy things from. ""Okay, well, can I have free snacks brought up to my room?"" I tell her I cannot give them to her for free but I'm happy to ring them up for her as a room charge and send them up. ""Yeah, no, you better either bring me an apple or tell your kitchen to get up off their ass."" (They're literally sleeping at home right now Princess, absolutely fucking not.) I reiterate when they open and repeat that we have a snack market. ""Well send me up apples and sandwiches from your stupid market then."" I tell her, no, we don't sell fresh open food in our market because that's what the kitchen is for. And our kitchen is closed currently.

""Well what good is the [Brand] then? Do you *at least* have weed papers?"" Uh. Lmao. We are a fully non-smoking hotel with a $250 fine. I let her know. ""We do not have nor sell any tobacco or smoking products of any kind, especially considering we are a non-smoking hotel where smoking is not allowed anywhere on the premesis."" This goes right over her head. ""Boring. Can I have free wine then? Take it up to my room."" Oh my fucking god, this woman. I tell her ""It's currently 4am, and per Oregon law I cannot sell or serve alcohol after 2:30am."" She responds ""you're not selling it, you're gonna give it to me for free. So *just deliver it.*"" I was literally speechless for a minute. I've dealt with karens, demanding people, and brats before, but I've never had someone command me around like that, especially over the phone, right after I told them what they're asking is illegal. I responded ""Under no circumstances is that happening. I will absolutely not sell or deliver wine to you. It is against the law until 7am to do so."" She's quiet for a moment (fuming I guess) and starts off raising her voice at me, ""well what good is the [Brand] then?? what's so good about this place?"" We are a very pricy hotel, and in fact, the most expensive hotel in the town. Her rate was somewhere at *~$300 a night.* I get she wanted fancy services you see in the movies, but this isn't Home Alone and she's not at the fucking Trump Tower. It's Oregon. Not New York. Not Las Vegas. We're not even in Portland, Bend, or another major city. It's a pretty small town. And it's a really nice fucking hotel, to be fair. 

I tried to tell her we have free convenient parking, we are the most secure hotel in town, we're spotlessly clean and modern, and she's currently sitting in a top floor corner room with a gorgeous view and a panoramic window, but before I could get a word in edgewise she demands we ""at least deliver 8 pillows so I can feel like I'm sleeping with someone tonight"". TMI lady, jesus christ. ""I'm sorry but we have a delivery limit. I can deliver a maximum of three pillows to you."" She responses to that by demanding 10 pillows instead. ""I can have three pillows delivered to you."" She hung up on me. I had my housekeeper deliver her 3 pillows... and a no-smoking notice, lmao. I'll throw an update on here in an edit if my GM or AGM decide to charge her a smoking fee.

#Update:

you'll all be happy to know I found her reservation was charged the smoking fee! I don't have any more updates right this minute, but I'll ask my AM shift coworker (the same one who made the charge) about it in the morning and edit in an update (if there is one) when I get home from work. The room is also listed as Out Of Order, unfortunately, because the smoking smell stuck to the room and we have to use a special machine to get the smell out (I believe we use an Ozone generator but I don't work with daytime housekeeping so I'm not actually sure what we use.) 

Point being, nobody was able to check-in to the beautiful high floor corner room she was in because it was out of order (we generally don't sell rooms that smell like a stale frat house.) We are also fully booked for that room type today. So a different guest had to check into a different room type (effectively a downgrade, although compensated) because of Princess's selfish behavior. So that sucks.",144,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CDEC5D60>
802,The Shiny Member who thinks me doing my job is wrong,"Im actually pretty pissed about this one, mainly because of said guests smart ass attitude.

anyway So the story goes like this: me= Docrato, Guest=shiney

So a guest comes up to the front desk to check in. She gave the name of some man and told me to check her in with the card on file. I know better than that, so I pulled up the reservation and see nothing on there mentioning its her or that shes able to check in. Just the mans name. So I inform her that Helliotts policy state we cant check in someone under someone elses name. Nor could we use the card on file to charge unless a CC authorization has been filled out OR management has left note of approval. None of that was there. So she gives me this ""oh great Im not getting my way"" kind of look and says she will wait for her husband instead. So I think ""alright cool she's being semi understanding about it""

Nope. In comes Shiney and the following conversation happens:

Docrato: well hello sir how can I help you?

Shiney: yeah so pretty stupid that my wife could not check in under a mobile check in. IM TITANIUM!

Docrato: Yes so I do apologize but policy states we have to verify who's who when checking in and unfortunately her name wasnt added so I cant hand out room keys and charge the card on file due to security reasons.

Shiney: But its not a problem! you made it a problem! IM TITANIUM!!!!

Docrato: I understand that sir. Im sorry Im just doing my job....

Shiney: AND THATS THE PROBLEM WITH YOU!!!!

Docrato: Me doing my job is a problem?

Shiney: Ha! vErY fUnNy!!!! whats your name?! docrato! Im going to let my concierge know about this!

Docrato: thats fine sir i'll be sure to inform management on my end.

Shiney: I DONT GIVE A FUCK ABOUT YOUR MANAGER

This kind of convo keeps going for a few more minutes of the same circling of the drain. Mainly comments from him about how I'm ""striving to be the worst hotel staff member"" ya know stuff like that. Send him to his room to be done with.

My thing is.... he KNEW what the policy was. He gave himself away with the whole ""and that's a problem with you"" when I said I was just doing my job. He wanted to be the exception and I wasn't gonna budge. Yeah it was a mobile check in, but his ""wife"" wasn't mentioned nor was there any kind of note/information stating she's allowed to check in under his name without the physical card present. Had the guest reached out to the hotel and informed us of such thing, then it would have gone smoother. But no, instead IM the one that's the problem because I'm following policy and trying to avoid fraud. What if she was an ex wife or something? She would've checked into his room under his card and I would've lost my job because instead of sticking to policy, I bent the rules so someone wouldn't be angry anymore.

Some word of advice for you shiny's that lurk and have this attitude, Don't do it. You only raise more red flags if you're that combative about showing ID, a valid CC, or any important information in general. Because in our minds, well mainly mine, we're thinking ""its not a problem why are you making it one? what are you trying to hide from me?"" EVERY HOTEL DOES SOMETHING DIFFERENT. You may stay at a property who DOESNT do any of those policy checks and will just hand you a key without even verifying and let you do whatever you want. STAY THERE! If that's what you want, then take that CC fraud risk to THOSE hotels because I don't want them here. Other hotels run things differently. for example, we HAVE to verify said guest is checking in NO MATTER THEIR TIER STATUS because in our town, we've had numerous cc fraud happening to rooms, that we've had to pay back because SOMEONE at the FD caved and let the guest bully them into doing what they want. So the district and GM have decided that EVERYONE gets verified at check in.

And don't yell at me when I'm just trying to help. It only makes me see you as an adult child.  You only hurt your own image, not mine.

803,Karmas a bitch aint it??,"The pos assistant manager they hired in is finally getting fired. Theres always something going on with him. Hes got a habit of no call no show never answers his phone and always giving discounts without authorization of the gm or owner. 

The owner of the company is fed up with his crap cause hes been costing the company so much money. 

We had a basketball team here a few weeks ago, they were already discounted for their rooms and tax exempt due to it being a school and this dumb ass discounts even more off their bill. Smh. 

Last week he had to work on one of his days off so he decides not to show up on his actual day he was supposed to work. Both the gm and i called and texted several times but no answer. I ended up having to stay over 3hrs and the fucker didnt even apologize when he saw me the next day. Its like im working for you when im wanting to go home you could a least explain yourself. 

He doesnt know how to talk to his staff and likes to throw us under the bus to make himself look better. 

Both the owner and the gm have been calling him for several days but no answer or call back. 

I get a call from the gm today telling me to take his time card and slide it under her door and if he shows up tomorrow to tell him he needs to call her. Hopefully she will get here early enough but idk. 

Ive gotten to the point of not having anything to say to him. If my shift was all good id leave it at that and he can deal with whatever on his shift. So not my problem anymore. 

Ive tried to be nice and friendly but when you have someone whos got that bad of a vibe coming off him then i leave it up to fait of what happens to you.

People involved are : Me, Girl and Boy. 

It is close to the holidays so it is slower during this period, and the staff (mostly overnight)  take to sitting the back of the office so we can stay as warm as humanly possible. So there I am sitting in the back doing some paper work for a department meeting coming up when I hear my doors open to the lobby. I watch the cameras to see if the person walk on and to my dismay they stop. I sign the form I was working on and get up from my desk. As I head the front I hear the BOY on the phone with who i assume is his friend. I couldn't hear his friend but Boy was loud and turned facing away from the desk.  This is the part of the conversation that I heard:

Boy: I don't know man. I'm  with this girl and she tryin' to stay the night and your grandma don't like that. 

(mumbles from other person on the phone)

Boy: No I don't know her name.

(mumbles) 

Boy: Well wtf am I supposed to do? Oh the lady is at the counter........ (walks to the desk) How much for one night tonight.

Me: 115+ taxes and deposits. 

Boy: Lemme go see if this girl has a card.

Me: Okay.

He comes in with a very young girl. I try not to judge age based on looks since I look like a young teen to older child due to my size. Sometimes, that upsets me. So I explain pricing, instant holds, and deposits. Everything was good and well until I asked for the I.D.'s. They were 16 and 17. I explained that they legally in this state cannot check in any hotel until they are the age 21. He left angry dialing someone on his phone. 

Girl: Sorry we haven't been together long.

Me: He doesn't know your name. You don't need someone like that. If you need I'll call and have someone pick you up. 

She stood there stunned and then soon left. I walked back to my office and noticed he was standing outside. So I watched him until he was picked up by and older woman and a young man.

805,Super shiny arrogance.,"Guest: hi checking in. 

Me: ok, the last name?

He gives me it. The reservation is prepaid and booked thru a third party. 

Me: ok, i’ll just need a photo id and a credit card for incidentals. 

Him: incidentals?

He looks confused. 

Me: yes…

Him: well, i’m a super shiny and i never pay for those or even get asked for it. 

Yeah, sure, ok. 

Me: every guest is required to have a card on file to cover incidentals. It’s a $25 hild per night. 

Him: well, can’t we just skip them?

Me: …no, it’s required for every guest…

Him: well, i’m super shiny, and i’ve never been asked this before. 

Me: sir, tou booked your room thru a third party that is prepaid. Those reservations only cover the room and tax, which is why i’m asking for a card now. If you book thru the brand with your account, you’re not asked to present those at check in, hence the reason why i’m asking for one now and likely why you haven’t been asked for it before. 

(He just stares at me blankly and hands me a card. I’m not letting you check in without incidentals just cause you think you’re above them)

Me: it’ll be a $50 hold that gets released when you check out. 

Him: well make sure my account is on there so i get my points. 

Me: i can certainly add it, but please be aware that because it is third party, you will not get points from this stay. 

Him: also weird, i’ve always gotten my points anyway, so idk why you wouldn’t give them to me. 

Me: it’s to my understanding that you only get the points when you book thru the brand. 

I hand him his keys and he leaves without giving me a chance to explain our free water bottles, coming down later demanding them. 

Another fun one:

Guest: first name last name, checking in. 

Before i’m able to say anything he says “i’m getting an upgrade, cause i’m super shiny”

People checking into rooms they shouldn't be, rooms being shuffled around, reservations being changed last minute. The guests are the sweetest people.

808,Religious permission,"I've been working the night shift for a while now, I've seen some weird stuff, usually caused by drunks, druggies, or crazies. 

For back ground, I'm Episcopalian, so I know nothing but what be you see in the movies about the Jewish religion. 

But this guy, he was nice, it was kinda hard to follow along his line of thinking as he stuttered, slurred (more like a lisp), and talked in circles, but after a while he got it out. I'll boil it down best I can.

 Essential, because he was Jewish he wanted permission to view the place like a convention and he would be checking in on a Sunday? Today is Friday? And insisted that the front desk personal had to give permission. BTW it's 3am. But screw it, I don't care that much as long as he doesn't bother the other guests or the overly excessive amounts of Christmas decorations we have everywhere ( by that I mean there are over 20 Christmas trees in the lobby alone)  So told him it's fine to view it however he wants. Which he was quite pleased with. Even left me a tip. 

Is that normal for my fellow front desk personnel?",70,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CD23CE80>
809,another win for an ESA guest,"Forgive me because I am ***triggered*** once again. I've posted about an ESA passing for service dog once before and since then have prepared myself for another ESA situation... but I got bested last night. 

I think I'm the only front desk agent that feels so strongly about ESA and how they shouldn't be allowed to stay on our SERVICE ANIMALS ONLY property. I think mainly because we get a lot of medical guests (we've got a hospital and cancer center nearby) and I want to make sure all of our guests are checked into urine free rooms.

ANYWAY SO I checked in a guy last night. A repeat guest, real nice guy. Doesn't say anything about a dog during check in. 

As I'm walking to our meeting space, I see him and a woman and their Goldendoodle walk into the elevator, they came in front our rear entrance.... and I'm like ""????"" - I give them a few minutes to settle and I call his room to very politely remind him of our pet policy. 

He said she is a service dog. I asked what work or task the dog has been trained to perform. He hands the phone to his accompanying guest who informs me she's trained in *emotional support*. I read verbatim from the Frequently Asked Questions about Service Animals and the ADA print out.... ""The ADA makes a distinction between psychiatric service animals and emotional support animals.""  So unfortunately that would not qualify... 

She's not having it. I let her know that I have the print out down at the front and I would be happy to review it. No, THEIR DOG IS A DOCUMENTED SERVICE DOG. From what I gather from here, paperwork is not necessary for a legitimate service dog. So \*eyeroll\* The guy who checked in, goes to his car, comes back with paperwork that I disregard... they already told me it's trained in emotional support, right?

I hand him the print out, he reads it over and reviews it, *then* tells me their dog *is* a service dog because it's trained to sense anxiety attacks. Which is conveniently the next line after what is highlighted on the print out (i.e. ""The ADA makes a distinction between psychiatric service animals and emotional support animals."") 

They've already told me it's trained in emotional support which is not the same as sensing anxiety attacks (IMHO)... so... 

I point out on the sheet ""Ok, just as a reminder the dog needs to be under it's handlers control at all times and cannot be left alone in the hotel room. Have a nice night."" 

Earlier today I'm 95% sure I saw the accompanying guest (who I saw for maybe a 1 second on the elevator) walk out without the dog... so like........ ???? 

***AND IDK WHY I'M SO BOTHERED ABOUT THIS.*** 

This is half to vent but also half to see if anyone would handle it differently regarding them changing their answer. Is it grounds to evict or charge a pet fee? Am I overreacting? Tell me to relax and it's not that serious lol",74,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CD23CCA0>

3. If you'd like your room close to another party, we will do our best to make that possible **but it is not guaranteed.**

4. If you'd like to check in early, we will do our best to make that possible **but it is not guaranteed.**

811,Guest supposedly loses charger in room and claims we’re responsible [UPDATE],"Apparently we can’t make text links anymore? I’ll link in the comments.

We suspected The Accuser would try something when she checked out and she did.

First she asked for a 1pm late checkout at 10:45am. Our normal checkout is at 11am so that request was denied.

Housekeeping had to bang in her door a few times and she finally came down at 11:30am. She repeated her story about her charger and the head housekeeper from yesterday was on shift so she personally went to check the room and no charger, no drugs, nothing. 

This time she didn’t imply anything she straight up accused housekeeping of stealing her charger. The clerk offered to contact the police so she could make a report but she didn’t respond to that.

She claimed the room next to her that she tried to break into was actually bothering her all night and she didn’t get any sleep and needed a refund.

Of course she didn’t report anything at all to the FD so that was denied as well.

She said she’s never stayed at a hotel that didn’t compensate her for her trials and tribulations. They just told her if you don’t report anything there’s not much we can do about it. 

She left and said she’s never going to return to our hotel again never again. Yay! They didn’t even have to inform her she’s DNRd. 

She got in her car and drove across the street to another hotel. I saw her there when I drove up for work she was talking on her phone in the parking lot staring at our hotel lol.

My GM knows their GM so she gave her the gist about her new guest.",66,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CD23C460>
812,Thank You for Lying to My Face,"I understand people being frustrated when thinks don't work out the way they expected. I really do.

Had a conference in town for the past few days and a group of rooms for one business in for it. This little group though, has been nothing but trouble. Their employer didn't properly send over their payment, and when all they employees heard about this, they were understandably frustrated when they had to hold the rooms on their cards until their Bosses got their crap together.

Except for one lady, who has been a hassle since check-in. She made me dig through record binders for information I knew wasn't there before she finally gave her card for her room. She's been bothering me every day about an issue she should be taking up with her bosses, and now that everything is finally settled payment-wise, decided to hassle me again about the hold on her card.

I had to tell her 3 times that it was a matter of how fast her back would release the funds. The kicker though is her telling me I didn't tell her about breakfast, which I am certain I told her about on checkin and I'm certain she's seen set up every day she's been here because everyone here for the conference has to walk right past it all to leave the hotel for their meetings every day.

I like business groups because it means I don't have to deal with negligent parents. I hate them because i have to deal with entitled people as well as businesses who refuse to follow standard procedure to set up their rooms causing their employees to blame us.",9,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CD23CD60>
813,Guest supposedly loses charger in room and claims we're responsible (accuses housekeeping of theft),"I got on shift and a few minutes later a woman walks in to rent a room. She requests a specific room which is occupied so I put her next door. Her room is adjoining to the one she requested. As I'm finishing up she mentions that she stayed in the room she first requested and was absolutely sure she left her phone charger in--no doubt it was in there and should have been turned in by housekeeping check your logs.

We keep a written log with tickets we staple to lost and found items and there was no entries for today. All the housekeepers have clocked out except for the head housekeeper who is finishing up laundry. I tell the lady that nothing was logged into lost and found today but if somehow we missed something I'd let her know. 

She corrects me and says she is absolutely sure she left it in the room--its behind the desk proof positive she left if plugged in and we missed it. Problem is none of our desks are placed in front of an outlet. So, I radio the head housekeeper and she comes to the desk. The Accuser and Head Housekeeper.

HH: Hello I'm the Head Housekeeper I understand you left something in your room last night?

TA: Yes and *points to me* told me ^(airquotes) that you all didn't find my charger in the room last night ^(end airquotes) I know I left it in there and I need it back. I paid $35 for that charger.

HH: We didn't find any lost and found items in that room and it is currently occupied and if they find anything we will let you know. If not we will double check the room to see if its there.

TA: It is there. I'm sure someone ""found"" it. 

HH: If we find a lost and found item in a room it is logged into our lost and found book. We have no entries for today so I'm sorry we didn't find your charger but once the room is vacated we will double check the room.

TA: OK so can I get credit for my charger, it cost me like $35 dollars.

Me: We do not give credit for lost and find items, we hold the items for a set amount of time for the guest to pick up at their convenience.

TA: But I left the charger in the room and no one ""found"" it so I guess BYEEEEE CHARGERRRRR I hope ya'll enjoy it.

She then tried to make some BS complaint about people next to her partying all night keeping her up. I asked her if she called the desk and she said she was too tired to but they were like super awful. I told her if that happens again to call us and we will address the issue. If we don't know about it we can't do anything about it.

About 15 minutes later the room next to her called and said someone was banging on their door and someone was trying to pick the adjoining room door. I reassured them that that is impossible and  I would check into it.

I went to The Accusers room and told her she can't knock on others guests doors and if she is trying to enter another guests room via the adjoining door I will call the police. She brushed that off and said she just wanted to ask them about her charger. I told her we will deal with it as was explained to her and if she continued to disturb other guests I will have her removed. 

I called my GM and she is now DNRd everything is notated on her file. I'm kinda hoping I will be given the chance to remove her shes weird in a not so good way.",102,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CD23C970>

(The locals) it's becoming absurd how many stupid reviews i have to respond to in a polite manner.

815,How do you not remember me?!,"So this will be kinda short, but I'm sure you can relate, right?

I just get to work and I walk by this guy standing in line to check in and he starts going on off saying HEY I remember you! Do you remember me? I just say no sorry, go behind the desk and clock in then sign in to synxis and he is the next guest to check in, so he keeps going on and on about how he remembers me, even though he keeps getting my name wrong, and can't understand for the life of him how I don't remember him.  I tell him I see thousands of people every year, I am glad I made an impression and it was special to you, but for me it was just another day at work.  I check him in and he goes about his way to his room.  A few hours later he comes back down and he's like ok so I know you gotta remember this, i was out front sweeping for you guys and i noticed something in your car, or maybe it was a sticker on your car or your license plate or something and we started talking about that and thats when we hit it off.  I just repeat myself saying it may have been special to you, but it was just work to me, I don't remember you, or anything you are talking about. Then he goes to the nearest gas station and asks if I want anything in a way that made me feel like he thought we were best of friends or something, to which i said no thanks.  I just don't get how people are so, idk, tunnel visioned that they only think of reality from their own perspective, like how can you not love this thing that i love there must be something wrong with you, how can you not remember something in the exact same way that i remember and feel about a thing we both happened to be involved with!?

817,Fire Alarm Drama,"So, there was a fire alarm activation around 6am that lasted for like 10sec if so. Some guests called down but they were informed that there was no need to evacuate. 

After aprox. 10 mins, a guest comes down to reception dressed in a three piece suit (important detail).

**G**uest: I heard the fire alarm. Do I need to do anything? 

**M**e: I'm really sorry sir but our security team checked and there is no need to evacuate.

**G:** Well, I was awaken by it and now I'm here and I'm not going back to bed so at least you should offer me breakfast.

**M:** I'm really sorry once again but the fire alarm is there to protect you and everybody else in the building. It was a real activation but fortunately there was no need to evacuate. On this occasion, what you are asking me is to compensate you for something that is actually mandatory for our building to be open to the public and we have actually acted on it as briefly as it is humanly possible.

**G:** So, you are not gonna give me breakfast when I woke up just because of it........ (and then he went on complaining about how it had disturbed him and that this had been so far his worst stay in a hotel ever bla bla bla).

It's impressive how people get so pissed of with fire alarms...

This guy in particular was probably already awake, was getting dressed with his THREE PIECE SUIT and came all showered with his impeccable hair and everything just to try to score some free breakfast.

**BTW:** We take note of the guests that call us and keep trackers when this situations occur. He had already called and knew perfectly he didn't need to evacuate.",45,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CD23C940>

Me: Hello, Front Desk. This is BlackHeart, how may I help you?

Guest: Yeah. I can't connect to your wi-fi. I'm putting in my room number and last name.

Me: Okay, I'm sorry about that. (walks him through how to connect with the promotional code, yadda yadda I do this about 10 times a day, so this is basic for me)

Guest: Great. ALSO, I cannot BELIEVE there isn't a single place to plug your phone into in this room!

\[Note: we do have plenty of outlets in the rooms, but we do not have USB adapters to plug in a phone without a power brick. We were going to do this renovation in 2020, but some obvious issues caused that to not happen. Our alarm clocks do not have USB connections, and we do not sell power bricks. It's an annoyance, but we never claim or advertise to have these options in any of our rooms. People just assume we do and don't ask before arriving.\]

Me: I do apologize, sir. We have, unfortunately, not gotten to that renovation yet. We are planning on that at the beginning of next year.

Guest: WELL, IT'S RIDICULOUS. Every cheap, crappy hotel I've stayed at has them! But this EXPENSIVE hotel doesn't? 

\[Another note: our rooms are pretty expensive, but that's more because we're under a worldwide brand and we have an incredibly desirable location that people are willing to spend more money on. Not exactly the Ritz, but our basic rooms start at $189/night on dead nights. Just to give ya'll an idea.\]

Me: My apologies, sir. I don't make these decisions.

Guest: I'm aware. Do you sell any adapters?

Me: I'm sorry, sir, we don't sell those.

Guest: THIS PLACE JUST GETS WORSE AND WORSE. I CANNOT BELIEVE THIS.

Me: (doing my best to smile while saying this so I don't come across as done with this conversation as I am) Is there anything else I can help you with, sir?

Guest: YES. You can tell me where to fill out the form-- I-- WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT? I work for BOOGLE(TM)! And I'm going to make sure no one with Boogle(TM) ever stays with you again! I can fix this myself!

821,I got yelled at in dutch,"I work at a small hotel in Oklahoma and most people who pass through are from the midwest or California either on their way to Texas or Florida. Yesterday, a couple approached the desk speaking mostly in dutch. I was super excited - I wanted to ask about the Netherlands and why they were visiting. As I was checking them in, I see they booked our hotel through a company called American Tours LLC. The reservation was for a week-long stay, but the card the company had provided was invalid. Uh oh. 

""I'm sorry, I can't check you in. It appears that the company you booked through gave us an invalid card. The stay is prepaid, correct?""

\*the woman shows me her receipt for the entirety of the trip\*

""Okay, yes, I will need to contact the company. May I see your papers?"" 

\*I take the booking papers and dial the international customer service number provided. No answer. I dial again, nothing. The couple tries, nothing.\* 

""Unfortunately, if I cannot contact a representative I cannot check you in under this reservation. We can charge you on your own card for just the night (eighty dollars), and you can contact them and have them reimburse you in the morning.""

The woman has become flustered and laughs at me in that condescending way that only hotel guests can - ""Well of course no one is answering! They are ASLEEP!"" She even had the nerve to roll her eyes at me. Uh?

""Typically companies that provide booking services have 24/7 customer service available for situations like this."" 

\*scoffs and smiles\* ""Sure. Well, you will let me into a room. I will not pay anything more."" 

""I cannot do that. You may have paid this company, but they have not paid us. Do you want me to make you a separate reservation?"" 

""NO!"" 

Okay. I apologize for the frustration, sit down, and pick up the book I was reading. I gave you your options and you refused. I don't know how to help you. 

The wife confers with her husband, who has been largely silent, and he gets the most enraged look on his face I've seen in a while. (To be fair, I would be enraged too if I booked an American tour of Oklahoma). 

Then, he begins yelling at me in dutch. A language I do not speak. It took everything in me to not stand up and yell at him in Russian and even the playing field. I mean, what are you trying to accomplish? None of this is my fault. It made me all shaky and anxious like it always does, but something about not even knowing what he was screaming at me especially pissed me off. The whole interaction was so pointless. The couple proceeded to sit on our lobby couch for thirty minutes until they finally realized I wasn't going to budge and conceded, rather snottily. 

""Here are your keys. We have a middle door you can pull around to if you have a car. It's the closest entrance to your room. Just make sure you have the company call us and we can get this sorted tomorrow.""

Around midnight, I get a request for more towels for a room on the second floor. I put the sign up that says I'm assisting a guest and will be back as soon as I'm able. I run down, grab the towels, go up the stairs, delivery the towels, where they request a blanket as well. So I go back downstairs to the laundry room, grab a blanket, go back upstairs and deliver that. 

When I get back to the desk pod, a man is pacing, the phone is ringing and when I greet him, he hangs up, the phone stops ringing and he starts screaming. Cursing at me, being completely unreasonable that I am the only person on staff at night and that I was assisting another guest. He storms off without getting his keys, and soon enough comes back to scream some more because ""the mobile key isn't fucking working!"" 

Of course it isn't working, you're being an ass, so I'm disinclined to make your night any easier. I make him some physical keys and activate the mobile key, but not before I politely ask him to stop yelling and swearing at me. He demands my manager's card. Fine, but the GM's just going to ask why he was swearing at his employee, but fine, not my monkey, not my circus anymore. 

About half an hour later, I see him return to the front desk. I sigh in anticipation of more needless yelling when the strangest thing comes out of his mouth.

She was originally scheduled to depart this morning (11/29) but needed to extend until tomorrow morning. Not a problem as we were nowhere near being sold out for Monday night. 

I pull up her profile and see that she checked in Thursday evening as a 'walk in' guest and was given the rack rate for each night of her stay. I quoted what the rate would be for Monday night ($156.99+tax) and she flips out, stating that since she's adding a fifth night, she's ""claiming her discount."" I ask her what discount that would be since I don't see anything in her profile about any discount. She says that it's ""common knowledge"" that if you stay in a hotel for five nights or more, you get a discount.

I told her that I've never heard of such a thing, and her rate for the additional night would remain the $156.99 I quoted her. She said ""fine,"" (rather snottily) and that she would speak with my manager in the morning. Well, lucky for me, my manager was the one who relieved me this morning, so I asked him about this supposed ""five night"" discount and he said he had never heard of it either (and he's been in the business longer than I have) and that basically the woman was full of crap (he's a no-nonsense, tell it like it is GM) and that if/when she came down, he'd set her straight.

Probably just another entitled Karen trying to see how much she could ""get"" out of me by trying to intimidate me with the threat of speaking to my manager. Crap like that doesn't fly at our hotel; our GM slaps crap like that down faster than a hiccup. LOL!!",75,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CD133CA0>
825,"Bigger hotel, bigger sense of entitlement!","Working at my first hotel was very up and down for the 4 years I was there but I finally made it out and made the jump from a 90 room BigBrand hotel to a 400 room BigBrandCompetitorHotel in the city. The company is a great company to work for, the hotel is nice and clean and not crumbling at the seems, and I was glad to be back working somewhere with higher occupancies to remind me of before covid.

Because the room number count is so much higher it didnt take long for some of my busiest check-in days ever to pop up but I handled it a lot better than I thought I would. Unfortunately even when all of your hotel related issues are solved at somewhere new you still have to deal with humanity. I think in one day I experienced the highest level of entitlement I have ever seen during my still short career in hospitality. 

About a month ago a concert was in town and all 300+ arrivals showed up around the same time which resulted in a huge line filling our lobby with all hands on deck at the desk. It was a steady flow with problems here or there from people having no ID or payment methods but otherwise smooth. About an hour or so in to the nonstop check ins I start hearing a noise and look 2 lines over to see a guy causing a scene by yelling at another desk agent. Everyone freezes and starts seeing what the hell this guy is going on about and a lady from my line starts yelling for him to chill out. Basically he was pissed he had to get a room key to use our 2nd floor bathroom which is not for public use and somehow that justified him screaming at my co worker because he was a shiny member.  About an hour after that I look over and someone else causing another scene as he starts speaking louder and louder literally because he thinks he is better than all the other people trying to check in and doesn't think he should have to wait in line like everyone else because he is shiny status. Then he starts comparing our hotel to a run down motel because we dont all shower him with infinite bonus points but make him get back in line with everyone else.",18,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CD133F70>
826,Annoying guest,"Anyone have tips on dealing with needy guests that expect you to chat with them EVERY shift? I do the 11-7am and every goddamn shift there’s an old lady that comes down around 3am and asks if I made fresh coffee and is up my ass until 7 basically. I finish my by the time she comes down but I get annoyed as hell feeling obligated to keep my headphones out incase she needs to ask some stupid question like “is it cold out” or ask me to print out her 10 page receipt even though the states covering it and the GM told her not to worry about it countless times. 

I feel bad she’s lonely but I kind of dread every time I see her. I know it’s customer service and all but am I really obligated to just sit here dealing with this..? Sorry it sounds immature and bitchy, she just came down so this is a little venty.

My supervisor purposely doesn’t make coffee overnight to avoid her visiting him, so she knows when I work and only comes down those nights.. I’d feel bad not making the coffee for people but I wish she’d just have her coffee and go back to her damn room once in a while instead of blast shit on the lobby computer/chitchat about the most mundane things.",53,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CD1334F0>
827,Apparently asking a guest to leave is racist now,"So I work at a small motel currently, but have been working in hotels across all sizes for about 4 years now, today had a guest video tape me and call me a racist. So it all started with my previous shift renting a room to this couple, her and her girlfriend had stayed here a couple days ago and fought in our room and caused a whole scene that night, but we dealt with it and gave them a chance and told them to please stop making noise and running up and down the hotel crying and screaming as guests are getting disturbed otherwise we would be forced to ask them to leave. We put her girlfriend on the DNR list but today she took the room under her ID so my frontdesk had no clue who they were. We have a strict 2 person policy, like no visitors and stuff, that has been the rule and practice for many years in the motel industry in this city. After renting the room, not 10 minutes later we see 4 people enter the room and by that time my frontdesk figured out that it was the same ladies from the previous night. 

So, we call the room and let them know they cant have 4 people in the room and we asked them to come get their money and leave as we did not want to further create any issues and want them off our property due to the last experience. She comes down and now insists that we cannot refund her money on her card which she paid with and wants cash. Told her that is not the policy and what is stopping her from taking our cash refund and going 2 or 3 days down the line and doing a charge back causing us to be double in the red. Whilst I am trying to explain this to her she is already claiming discrimination, racism, sexism. All just for cash, told her again you used a card, we have to refund you that money on that card, I do not know any business that does a cash refund if you've paid by card. 

By this point she has her phone out recording me, calling me all sorts of things and stating that I am racist, she is going to sue me for racism and discrimination, She has raised her voice throughout this whole conversation, I've maintained my composure still trying to make her understand why it is she is getting kicked out. Now she starts saying that we never told her the policy, you signed the fucking folio that clearly states it, there is a board in the lobby the size of window stating all of our rules and you stayed her 3 days ago and we told you the policy then too! Like what, she says shes calling the cops leaves the office and goes to her car. 

5 minutes later, she comes back throws her card at me, says shes called the cops, shes calling her lawyers, shes calling civil services, shes calling the state offices, I dont know who else she called, might have called biden too, I take her card refund her money and she still refuses to sign the refund copy, she created such a spectacle of herself. Finally she leaves after saying fuck you to me and my colleagues. 

Like so everyone is automatically racist now, you know the policy, you know the rules, you have been given chances but still want to sit on top of your throne like we owe you something. You want to claim discrimination and racism while slinging racist slurs yourself, what makes you the exception to the rule! I love working in the hotel industry but people like this really make me want to quit.    

Sorry long post.",109,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CD133F40>
828,I CANT GIVE YOU WHAT I DONT HAVE,"Gonna be a long one i need to vent 

idk if its the holiday week or some sort of vibe coming off the late full moon or if im about to start my period  but between staff and guest everyone has been nothing but flat out rude fucks. 

At this point when people say they are going to give a bad review i really dont give 2 shits. Already short staffed they aint gonna even displine me. 

First it was my am person always coming in late like 10 to 15 min and havent said anything to the gm letting her get away with it. I work another job she knows that i need to be gone on time to make it to the other job. I nicely as i could asked her to start getting here on time and all she said was "" if you need to go then go. Lock the desk and put the sign up."" Ummm no it dont work that way people need receipts or need hsk or towels or some random thing and someone need to be at the desk at all times. So to me thats like a slap in the face since i havent said shit to anyone. Not to mention kind of being disrespectful to your cowoker who been nothing but nice to you. 

Then we have the good for nothing assistant manager. He always seems to have some sort of an emergency. Well apparently Saturday night there was one but instead of informing me in the middle of the night he doesnt wven show up for work. He had about 50 to 60 missed calls and texts from both me and the gm. He looked at her text at 930 left it on read and then didnt text back till 430 9 hrs after he was supposed to be there. Saying ""he had a altercation and just woke up"". No call no texts nothing cause he turns his phone off and never answers back. And the fucked up thing about that was he never apologized or gave me an explanation. If im covering for you on a no show no call i deserve that much. 

Then we come to the guest...  

One room on friday wanted her room like a hot day in hell but the unit is regulated to only go so high. Gave me a bad review. I only go off what im told by the owner. Kept say she stayed at a different hotel and it went higher. Ok and??? Go stay over there then. 

Then another room sat night wanted not 1 but 5 extra pillows on top of what is already in her room. We are a small hotel and was almost booked and dont have an infinite supply of pillows to give out. And max is usually 2. I told her i didnt have anymore ( i really didnt) but she insisted that i give her pillows now. After telling her i didnt have any to give she tells me that we arent full and that we have spares. Ummm ok karen. 1 we are almost full 2 i have about 8 more arrivals for the night and 3 i dont have any to give you. She informs me shes gonna give a bad review. Ok booboo i dont give a shit. 

Then we have guest #3. First he wants a discount. Members really only get like 3 bucks taken off. He ask if i have  anymore i say let me go look they may be upstairs. I go look and apparently guest have taken them in their rooms i cant determine where they are. They were all gone when i clocked in. I come back down and say sorry i dont have any rn they are all in rooms. He says he has a lot of stuff. (I mean how much stuff could you really have for a 1 night stay??) Grant it he did have 2 kids but when he did finally unload it was all on wheels and he had his wife with him. When i told him i didnt have any carts he wanted to then cancel the room after ive already processed everything. Nothing i could to at that point i dont have the authorization to do refunds for credit cards. Hed have to talk to the gm in the morning. He makes the wise choice to keep the room. He prob wouldnt have been able to find another room within 20 miles this town was pretty full over the weekend. But seriously dude i cant give you what i dont have. 

And to top all of this off guest #4 had wanted some money back because they wernt staying they checked in around 5pm and came to the desk around 1am to ""check out"". She had 3 rooms and i guess they just used it to shower and get ready for their event idk we dont really ask questions. But when its 1 in the morning theres no way youd be getting any money or discount back. You was in that room for god knows how long i dont have hsk here to clean it for a walk in so youd either have to use it or lose it. No hotel is going to let you use the room and then refund part of your money. Ive never heard of them doing that. I told them its prob best they just sleep in them for a few hrs. Better to utilize what you have now. 

Also had 2 kids prob late teens try to get into a room thats already been check out. Their names wasnt even on so no way would i have been able to let them in it without the primary guest on the room. Ugh kids. 

And lastly we come to mr boozy. He was part of the wedding party we had in house. When he got back he asked where a good bar was i told him the big one is a few miles down the road. Him and his friends come back around 245 in the morning. He wanted to buy some wine. Due to our lovely laws we arent allowed to sell after midnight on sat. Hes like oh ok and walks outside. But first asks if i knew where another bar was and if i knew where a swinger club was. Lol not really missing a beat i just smile and tell him you are jn the middle of nowhere youll need to head about 60 miles west to find one. Not like the advertised on facebook. And I kid you not he walks back in not even 5 min later and picks up 6 bottles of wine. I inform him yet again I CANNOT SELL YOU THAT AT THIS TIME. its 3am due to the state law we cannot sell after midnight. He put them on the counter and leaves. Finally goes to his room around 330. I guess they had sex the their car idk. I was doing my paperwork. 

So yea what a fun filled week ive been having. So ready to just walk out the door. Job lined up or not im to my breaking point. Theyd be fucked if i quit now. My pt na cant work full time and the gm or the am wont cover na. So if i leave they literally have no one. So go ahead pillow karen and sauna karen leave bad reviews i dont give a fuck. Right now i have job security. 🙄

829,Help!!,"OK so my managers are currently not available and I have no idea what to do and the situation is currently going on right this moment, a guy came here to participate in some illegal activities with a guest. apparently he got robbed so now he wants to come and have us contact police. am I supposed to? Can the guest sue my company for accusing them of something ,we have no proof of ? This guy refuses to call the police himself, he would be incriminating himself and HAS participated in an illegal activity so he wants the hotel to do it. 
Because he was participating in something illegal isn’t this just out of the hotel’s hands since one of the parties Is a guest ? So either he contacts police his self or he just has to except his loss right?

*edit* thank you guys so I choose to just inform him he would have to call the police, he informed me he was only 17 (Legal age of consent in Texas) but also he was the one still trying to Pay for relations and he even showed me proof that he contacted this guest of ours to purchase relations so he ended up being upset and leaving and I’m almost positive he is not going to call the police because then he would be pretty much telling on himself to. I also decided to go on ahead and leave a note for management. Something that doesn’t sit right with me is I’m almost positive he was recording me and I’m not even comfortable with putting myself on the Internet yet like that considering I am currently working on the back end of starting a YouTube channel and twitch channel and now there’s a Rando who has a random video of me telling him that he would need to be the one to call the cops 😑",54,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CD133C40>
830,Sure I could make this up... but would I?,"This happened a couple of weeks back. Buckle up!

I had this ShInY tOp TiEr member walk in at like 8 AM and unload like 4 boxes of joint rolling papers + 2 random boxes on our luggage cart.

Me: No sir. It's been less than a minute...

STTM: I'LL HELP YOU OUT! > : ( \*grabs our business card and writes his name and confirmation number and just walks out of the hotel and drives away\*

uuuuuUUUHhhHHH several hours pass, he returns.

STTM: I'M HERE TO CHECK IN.

Me: Yessir. The reservation never came through... maybe it was booked at the hotel down the street? That happens a lot. 

STTM: [NO](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/6c/b3/bf/6cb3bfc057f4af2c0ae30609f75ea485.gif), IM ALWAYS HERE I KNOW HOW TO BOOK A ROOM HERE.

Turns out, he doesn't. We have another hotel with the same name a few minutes away. [And](https://media1.giphy.com/media/du92BDhPYIZXeV21Jo/giphy.gif?cid=ecf05e47v4e23zx7amtgc2baoepgzsq6o1n17apxn6trep1x&rid=giphy.gif&ct=g)... that's where he booked.

I get a call from the Front Desk Agent a few hours later that the [hotel fire alarm is going off](https://media1.giphy.com/media/MZocLC5dJprPTcrm65/giphy.gif?cid=ecf05e47uatfvi1pr6zn4plv0xa5olis2ty5ohgnx00k3opm&rid=giphy.gif&ct=g) ( I hear it ). The Front Desk Agent goes to where the panel shows the issue was, discover there's no fire or issue, it gets disabled. Several guests exited the hotel and waited for the okay to return to their rooms, because generally that makes the most sense. She gives the [okay](https://media2.giphy.com/media/k2bbmbmvUo7gA/giphy.gif?cid=ecf05e47ska4af9ucmgvvkuhqfnyh0kqdc53bra1anh179di&rid=giphy.gif&ct=g) and everything returns to normal.

The next morning, I'm doing the regular AM tasks (also training a new girl who was working at a different brand hotel down the road). We [notice](https://media4.giphy.com/media/vtBMnEl4XT3Ow/giphy.gif?cid=ecf05e474wf5farzciwx10kmyxcp23st5o1luzxzrynz7v4a&rid=giphy.gif&ct=g) these sketchy acting guests coming in and out of the hotel (2 guy twins). She claims she was familiar with them from her previous hotel, said they're druggies. So we do our best to [monitor them](https://media2.giphy.com/media/l396Irluy9lYrueME/giphy.gif?cid=ecf05e47wvdj7hgl3imr8z3qke5qfs7pvx0z1ss0dva8simk&rid=giphy.gif&ct=g).

Time passes, guests start checking out. There was this real cute petite blonde girl walking up to the desk. Her hands were shaking and her face was red. She looked visibly upset. So, we're asking her if she's okay and she's like ""not really"". She was explaining how one of the sketchy men that we noticed at the front was waiting at the elevator landing and made her severely uncomfortable. Like he was there waiting. No phone. No luggage cart. Just leaned against the wall, waiting. As she was checking out, he came down from the elevators and walked to his car... and waited... with his door open... 

For her safety we asked her to wait in the lobby with us until the man left. She wasn't in a rush to go anywhere, luckily. The same man exits his car and walks up to the building (we're all windows) and sees she's sitting down and walks back to his car and waits. So we [move her](https://media3.giphy.com/media/l2SpUN7USRf6tIKXe/giphy.gif?cid=ecf05e470erpfqcuiyghnnig6myvmmfhnrwhhgg7xyaocpi6&rid=giphy.gif&ct=g) to one of our vacant ready rooms on the first floor (she was on the 4th floor with one of her girl friends). 

The man waits a bit longer then comes back into the hotel. Notices the lobby is now empty then heads to the elevators. Our GM follows him and [gets on the elevator with him](https://media0.giphy.com/media/dUMyRVhUMmD1m/giphy.gif?cid=ecf05e47anxlbzexhl5y3ujng4o422m623pgge7k3c23i4b2&rid=giphy.gif&ct=g), we want to find out what room they're in. So the man exits the 3rd floor, as does the GM, the man questions what floor the GM meant to get off at, as soon as the GM starts walking around on the 3rd floor, the man immediately gets back on the elevator and goes to the 4th floor! As the man enters the 4th floor, me and the new girl inform the GM ([we are watching the cameras](https://media1.giphy.com/media/L3ERvA6jWCd0qO4NdX/giphy.gif?cid=ecf05e4728dzt58i4qbeangvuhy4fro5t7fc18p3gisioyqq&rid=giphy.gif&ct=g)). Our GM takes the stairs and as he's making his way to the 4th floor, we notice the man starts from the end of the hall and starts trying to open room doors!!! Just going [door to door](https://media0.giphy.com/media/Gx9JkhbjcL8E8/giphy.gif?cid=ecf05e47ic51rcrlukk3wsdhvjucj20pl08xc990virc3ub6&rid=giphy.gif&ct=g) pulling on handles.

We are in one of the top 5 largest cities so we're familiar it may [take a while](https://media2.giphy.com/media/l46Cgctdy5C23iB0c/giphy.gif?cid=ecf05e47c6y8y9j5k74r6uaedbkyq7keoykg57m2x9eue8en&rid=giphy.gif&ct=g) for the police to arrive. The GM informs me he noticed a big knife on the man's person when they were in the elevator and I let dispatch know this to hopefully get this hurried along. 

The guy sees our GM on the 4th floor and decides to take the stairs to [exit](https://media0.giphy.com/media/j0gQA2VD38NKc9rc8y/giphy.gif?cid=ecf05e474ef2tgydav0uln65f48n10p69it45ut9po2d3cbr&rid=giphy.gif&ct=g) the building. Our GM follows. He gets in his car with the other sketchy guy and they start to leave. As they're leaving, our GM takes his [phone](https://media1.giphy.com/media/QAD2c9bfVENP2Rig82/giphy.gif?cid=ecf05e471gen1uuat9xke1pi3fl1jdshfzrmt9eux4tlayyv&rid=giphy.gif&ct=g) out to capture their license plate for when the police arrive. They see him taking a picture and they put their car in reverse!!! So our GM comes back inside and locks the entrance. We all [hide in his office](https://media1.giphy.com/media/l0MYFPAHLoJ9I6IM0/giphy.gif?cid=ecf05e474u5lny3jvqw1pdfqw6bcwg6im11qt8r5sbi7ia6l&rid=giphy.gif&ct=g) with the cameras. We see the guy walk up to a locked door and empty lobby, he starts knocking trying to get our attention. We don't entertain it, so they finally drive away. 

Minutes later, the police arrive. We explain the situation. They questions us and the girl that was upset during check out. A few minutes later, the phone rings so I answer. ""Thank  you for calling the hotel, how can I help you?"" ""Uuuuhhhh, there was some guy outside recording my car and I want to know why!"" ""[Oh](https://media3.giphy.com/media/LyJ6KPlrFdKnK/giphy.gif?cid=ecf05e47en8eup73m48pc1445ct2rxii3y0cfc8bw1jc0tfx&rid=giphy.gif&ct=g), wow, that's definitely uncomfortable, let me place you on hold to see what's happening..."" and I transfer the call to the GM's office where he is sitting with the police officers. One of the officer's pretends to be the GM and plays dumb to keep him on the phone while they run license plate information and look up the phone number. 

Turns out! The license plate was registered to a man with [MULTIPLE FELONIES](https://media3.giphy.com/media/xUPGce1Q9vVEtaAcms/giphy.gif?cid=ecf05e479j7k3y2ho4txllyfjl7r1kr0zr1ch0rdb951zcw0&rid=giphy.gif&ct=g). So they decide to wait a bit longer in case the men return. 

A few minutes after the phone call ends they notice the car attempting to enter the parking lot until they notice the police officer! So! THEY TAKE OFF. The officers run to their car and [THE CHASE IS ON](https://media0.giphy.com/media/tmedG7fmPSBLa/giphy.gif?cid=ecf05e47587p1slqtiijwu1guj4el4k0u71u81s8xe14hiok&rid=giphy.gif&ct=g)!!! 

We get a call back a little later that they lost them. We have a major highway literally 200-300 feet away from us... so... [cool cool cool](https://media1.giphy.com/media/ZUkausLsSMJpu/giphy.gif?cid=ecf05e47nboba54r17slul4rqqvjjeeb0i3y7vilv9syuj6z&rid=giphy.gif&ct=g). Doesn't make us nervous at all. But we decide they've probably been too spooked to return. 

We tell the girl the sketchy men are gone. She sneaks out eventually. She said earlier she didn't notice them prior to seeing the guy in the elevator landing but suggests what if *they* saw her earlier in the day and *they* pulled the fire alarm to [lure](https://media3.giphy.com/media/xTiN0gQHPvjDN58Zk4/giphy.gif?cid=ecf05e479j7k3y2ho4txllyfjl7r1kr0zr1ch0rdb951zcw0&rid=giphy.gif&ct=g) her out of the room. It honestly didn't seem unrealistic at the time. 

Me and our area sales director go to lock the guests out of the room and ensure the room is empty so we can have a shenanigan free night. 

I get a call from the GM - ""you'll never guess who set the alarm off!!!!"" 

...It was our sHiNy tOp TiEr MeMbeR[!!!!!!](https://media2.giphy.com/media/3o7budfxOQGPssmQN2/giphy.gif?cid=ecf05e47422hcudbn4a59195w6ynv2t151kg1ungn8mb6jfl&rid=giphy.gif&ct=g)

We charged his card the smoking fee of $300. He's now banned permanently from our property.

831,"Honestly, yeah, fire me","Our hotel authorizes the first night room and tax prior to the guest checking in (especially on Friday and Saturday night). Then we have the guest enter their card upon check in for *everything* (room, tax, and $100 incidentals). From what I gather, that's pretty much the norm. Yes?

So they get double authorized. 

I checked in a guest the Friday before last. She wanted to use a different card because she didn't have enough for our incidentals. Her card for room and tax was double authorized as it normally is. While checking her in, she got the notification her account was overdrawn. I apologized, explained why our policy is enforced (we were sold out that night and she reserved 1 of our 2 two queen suites), told her to give her bank a call and we will talk to her bank and let them know we've already released the funds etc etc so she can get her money asap, she said it was fine and went to her room. 

I found out several days later that she complained on me! That \*\*I\*\* specifically meant to overdraw her account and that I should be fired for this. Like I'm a menace to society for this specific occurrence. 

About 15 minutes ago, I got a call from another guest that was irate regarding her account being double charged because of the this. Like, I totally get it. I couldn't afford to stay at my own hotel based on this policy alone.

The verbal abuse is getting to me. I'm 5 days into my 9 day in a row schedule and I'm 2 more confrontations from quitting!

It had a whole tank with a filter and everything and she left food with instructions on how to take care of it. If we didn't want it we could just throw it away. The entire time she's telling me this, her husband is a few feet behind her shaking his head.

I stammered out the only thing I could think to respond with which was ""uh, okay."" Now, I didn't really want this fish, but I'm also not going to just throw it away because it's inconvenient. I figure okay, guess we're going to have a watery front desk pet now. Rosie the Attack Muppet is going to have a new friend. I know fuck all about caring for fish and really didn't want to have to pay to make sure it was in a good set up. But I was *also* starting to try to think of a funny name for it.

Fortunately none of that was needed, the husband came back to the desk again a few minutes later and assured us that he'd be back for the fish. His wife was just having some anxiety. Sure enough, about twenty minutes after they left he came back for the fish, and I breathed a sigh of relief.",31,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CD133E20>
833,Who Really Wants to Work Audit?,"I’ve worked NA for 10 years now at a full service hotel. My shift is Sunday - Thursday and I take off a week in July, October, November, and December. I don’t call off and I always show up for work. Since I live in an area that gets a lot of snow, I will get a room at the hotel if we are expecting a lot of show in the afternoon so I can come to work. For years, I would always get 40 hours and never worked other shifts. That’s the way it goes. 

There is a mutual understanding at my hotel. Audit is covered on my days and the hotel doesn’t have issues. I don’t call managers for stupid questions and they don’t get guest complaints about me. I can handle almost all issues on my own and if I do call, it’s bad! I don’t ask for a lot and in turn I’m not get given busy work. I’m not folding towels, making keys, or stocking the gift shop, but audit gets done, the day will roll, and issues handled.  I then get paid to baby sit the hotel. You are paying me not get called or have to work my shift and your shift. 

New manager and HR inform me I am going to start working at 2am and work until 11am to drive the shuttle bus in the AM starting the next week.

On my way home from work, I stop by another hotel ask if they need a night auditor. FOM tells me his just quit. I tell him how long I was at my last hotel. Explained why I was looking for something else and what I was looking for. FOM asked when I could start. I said tonight. We agree to fill out new hire paperwork after we run EOD.

I asked if I could use the business center computer to type my resignation letter and returned to the hotel and let my newly hired FOM know I worked my last shift.",167,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CD133BB0>
834,Bonus time at work. They just gave me the push to move on.,"It's a seasonal job, the property closes at the end of October. Bonuses handed out in November.  

The pandemic did not slow things down for us - we were busier than ever this summer. Busier and more profitable than pre pandemic. I stepped into a larger role for the same wage. Management changed, things seemed to go smoothly all season. When we wrapped up for the season everyone was happy, I was asked repeatedly to come back for opening in the Spring.  

Bonus time. I'm not one to count my chickens before they hatch. Always stressing to my husband (whose job is 50% bonus based) that a bonus is just that, something you shouldn't and can't count on but enjoy it when you get it. Well, I am eating my words now since this bonus is not going to pay for groceries.  

According to the bonus I am 92% LESS valuable than last year. That's right. I was given a bonus check in the high TWO digits this year. Last year, it was FOUR digits. Next year, I will be somewhere else. No bonus would be less insulting than this.",106,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CD133730>
835,What day is today....?,"I just love it when guests come in and they say they want them check in and I look all over for their reservation and they say they made it and I can't find it then I remember up it's past midnight. 

So I go to look up the next day and sure enough there it is for the next day I tell the guests so your reservations for tomorrow not today. And of course their responses well we'd like to check in now.  Yeah..... That's not how this works unfortunately I mean if I have the room available sure I could check you in but there is a $75 extra fee. And their response usually goes well we don't want to pay the fee we want to check in now for the room that we booked for tonight. 

How do you argue with idiots and tell them your room's not booked for tonight it's booked for tomorrow night.  Now it becomes one big carousel going round and round. 

There are times when people know how to play the system they know that if they make the reservation for Sunday and there are plenty of rooms on Saturday but Saturday rooms are gonna be more expensive than the Sunday room so if they're able to move the room they hope that the rate won't change.  The thing is I also know that system so usually I go oh just so you know there is a rate change because if you're going to have it on a Saturday the rate does go up. And if they booked it through a 3rd party I tell them unfortunately you'll have to cancel that reservation and book a new reservation for tonight. 

 Unfortunately it usually ends up with them leaving in a huff because they couldn't get their way and because they didn't plan properly.",53,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CD133F10>
836,Gotta love the “Right to refuse service”,"This is gonna be a short one. Just happened moments ago, right before the end of my shift *insert HUGE FUCKING EYEROLL

It’s the last 5 minutes of my shift I don’t wanna do shit. I just want to browse Reddit or text my girlfriend about what we are going to have for dinner tonight.

In rolls a truck (fucking great) two guys get out. First guy seems normal, second is not. 2nd guy gets out and starts stumbling, pours out what is clearly a beer all over the drive way, and throws the can in the bushes 

The front desk is like 5 yards away from the front door so I’m seeing all this shit.

They get up to the counter and ask for a room for tonight.

Me: “Yeahhh… did you just dump your beer out in our driveway (right in front of the door) and toss the can in the buses..?”

Drunk Douche: “Nah we don’t do that here. This is such a nice place! This is the *Beep* Hotel right? So nice.”

Non drunk friend: “Can we get a room for tonight?”

It’s 5 mins before I leave so I already logged out of the front desk program and had the time clock ready to punch out right at 8. Def not logging back in to do anything let alone help these douche bags 

Me: *presses random buttons on keyboard* “oh sorry it looks like we are sold out” 


They leave thankfully with no issue and I clocked out. It’s fucking 8 o’clock dude was already so wasted. Great, now I want a drink…",24,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CD133D90>
837,No good deed goes unpiunished.,"*Why is this text optional Reddit?*

Anyways, I was working the AM recently, and doing some paperwork in the back. Busy day, breakfast was over, checkout time was near but not yet here.

Que fire alarm going off. We recently had our fire panel replaced, and it hasn't actually go through a full test (the alarm company is busy, and under staffed, and we have up to 30 days I believe they said). So no huge worry yet.. I go check the panel reading:

Smoke detector public bathroom.

Okay, that's a 20 second walk, I'll go see what's on fire. Walk over there, as a bunch of people start heading for the door.. Because of the fire alarm.

See a disheveled lady heading to the door, nothing too strange other than she was coming from the bathroom area. I knock, men's room clear, no smoke or people.

Ladies room, clear of people, but has a chemically smell. Oh. Well, I bet I know what happened there. Confirm with our maintenance that there is no fire in the other public reset rooms (pool) and we silence the alarms. Wait for fire dept. before resetting, making sure all is actually clear.

Que quiet time at the hotel, post check out time, pre check-in time.

Decide to look back at cameras and see where Mrs. Likely-Homeless Lady came from...

Looks like she came in the front door, and went straight to the bathroom area. Okay, lets go back from there, likely a random person from the street.

Wait, she's coming out of the side entrance to the hotel? Up the stairs? Into a room? Oh... That room.

Turns out she was from a room that we'd have some weird staff interactions with. Late night shop purchases, strange behavior, not remembering the name on their room...

And the room is under a rewards account (not a points stay, just has an account attached). I charge the card on file the smoking fee (because we're no smoking, even in our public bathrooms), and then call them to let them know.

&#x200B;

Who do I get? An actual answering machine (from like the 30s! Okay, probably the 80s or 90s, but wow that takes me back) with an older lady asking me to leave a message for her or her husband.

\~Message here to call hotel about their rewards account.\~

Time passes.

I get a call about an hour later from answering machine lady:

Answering Machine Lady: I am returning a call, I'm not sure who I'm supposed to talk to, it was about my account?

Me: Oh, that'd be me. It looks like you had a reservation with us for a few nights.

AML: No, I don't have any reservations.

Me: I mean, you stayed with us for the last couple nights and checked out today?

AML: No, I got a room for one night, earlier this week for a man who I was trying to help out..

Me: Do you happen to know his name?

AML: No, I don't, I was just trying to be nice, he needed a place for the night.

Me: Well, he stayed until this morning, and charged somethings to the shop under your account.

AML: \*hollers at ?husband? in background\* Oh, I think he fucked me...

I chuckle here, cause normally I don't hear people of that age group swearing quite so blatantly.

She didn't response, so likely didn't hear me. It's not funny what happened, but still was shocked by her response to it.

AML: How much did he end up charging?

Me: About $800 dollars, including a smoking fee.

AML: I was clear when I checked them in that it was for only one night.

Me: I don't see any notes to that, but I'll talk to the person who checked you in, when they come in an in hour and figure it out. I'll get back to you next Monday morning and let you know how we'll handle this then.

Time passes.

She calls back.

AML: Sorry, I just had to take a deep breathe. You said he had a reservation for 3 nights? So he's still there?

Me: No ma'am. He stayed 3 nights, starting when you checked him in, and departing today.

AML: So he left?

Me: Yes.

\- This is all paraphrased, at one point I told her I did add them to our DNR list, as hers was the only name on file.

AML: I need you to take me off your Do Not Rent list, me and my husband travel all the time, and we're  members.

Me: I already did, it wasn't your fault what happened, but I won't be able to make any changes to the charges until I speak with my Front Desk Agent.

AML: Oh alright. Please call us as soon as possible.

Little back and forth about that, and that I'll be next in on Monday, and call her as soon as I can.

End Recap.

So... Do I refund them for the smoking charge, as it wasn't actually in the room, so it didn't need to be put OOO and didn't cost us revenue? I'm going to.

Do I refund the nights the guy stayed? I will likely, unless my FDA tells me something otherwise about the check in.

Do I remove the shop charges? This one I might not... As we actually lost product here. I know it wasn't her fault, but that also doesn't restock my shelves.

838,"""We'll stay for 4 nights, so we only pay a fourth of the price per night, right?""","So I just got a call. They needed a room for four. We don't have those, so we setteled on two twin bed rooms. They ask for the price. 131€ per room and night.

Entiteled Caller: But that's for both rooms, right?

OP: No, like I just said, it's per room and night.

EC: But we're staying for 4 nights, could we get it cheaper?

OP \*calculating in his head, about to offer 100€ per room/night\*

EC: We were thinking 30€ per night for all of us.

""Well no."" 
She then demands that she wrote the maintenance request form instead of me. I tell her, ""you know our maintenance guy just throws these away when he's done with them...""
""Yeah whatever. Let me take a picture of this! Also I demand to speak to your manager so I can get this room for free!""
Okay she'll be here Monday morning.
""I want to talk to her now!""
Anyway, I give her the Manager's card and she goes away. I hear the phone in her office ring not even two minutes later, it goes to voicemail.

840,Thank you for dumping your awful extended families at our hotel for the holidays,"Five months. I have worked at this property for five months. And in those five months, I'd say 9/10 guests have been overly pleasant. Every now and then, someone will complain. Someone will be really weird. Someone will have horns blown on their behalf and a red carpet thrown across the floor as to not soil their pristine Super Shiny Status shoes.

But for the most part, the guests here haven't been so bad.

*And then this past week*, the sun fell behind the darkest of clouds, the temperature dropped below freezing, an eerie silence befell the rolling hills and frigid mountains, and the leaves eagerly fled from the trees to burrow deep in the ground, hiding among the company of bugs and other critters terrified of what they sensed was coming: *Dawn of the Karens.*

""We want a quiet room, no road noise,"" a big bag-toting, dyed blonde hair creature bellowed at me and my co-worker upon entering the lobby.

*Our hotel is nowhere near a major road. But okay, maybe you don't know that.*

Not even ten minutes passes, and the situation repeats with what was undoubtedly a clone:

""We want a quiet room, no road noise,"" a big bag-toting, dyed blonde hair creature bellowed at me and my co-worker upon entering the lobby.

Later, the lobby doors open once more.

""Do you have to work Thanksgiving?"" a lady asked me on check-in, one day before the holiday.

""I do. I'll be here.""

She puckers her lips and feigns sorrow.

""Awww,"" she coos. ""I hate making *my* employees work on the holidays.""

*I bet you feel reeeeeeal bad about it as you drop $200 staying with us tonight, ma'am.*

Another lady walks in.

""I'd like to check in.""

Me: ""Okay, what's the name?""

""It's under my husband's name.""

Me: ""Is he here with you?""

""*Um, excuse me sweaty* but no. He's not.""

Me: ""He'll need to be here with you to check in. I don't have your name on the reservation.""

""Um, *excuse me sweaty* but no. Other properties have let me do this before.""

Me: ""We can get in touch with him to verify you're allowed to check in under his stay.""

""*Um, excuse me sweaty* but *this is ridiculous*. Fine, call him.""

And I call him. And he's okay with it. But that's not the point.

The situation repeats, albeit a little differently, some time later:

""I'd like to check in.""

I find her reservation and proceed to start the check-in process.

""This is my husband's credit card.""

I stop and look at her.

""Is he here with you tonight?""

She looks offended.

""*Excuse me sweaty*, he's in another state but said I could use his card.""

*In my head, I am now pleading for Thor to strike me dead with a merciful bolt of lightning.*

""I can't use his card if he's not here,"" I reply.

""This is ridiculous. Other properties have let me do this before.""

*I bet they have.*

""I'll just step out and call him,"" she threatens, disappearing into the night.

I don't see her again for the remainder of my shift.

An older couple approaches the desk shortly after check-in. The man is balding, pale, and speaks like the worst impression of Tom Brokaw you've ever heard. His wife is smiling, pleasant, quiet.

Brokaw: ""Mrr, yeah. So we'd like to book another night.""

Me: ""Sure, I-""

Wife: ""I thought we were going to the other hotel tonight.""

Brokaw: ""Mrrr, no, we're staying here.""

Wife: ""But aren't we-""

Brokaw: ""Mrrrr, would you shut the hell up?*""*

Wife: ""You said-""

Brokaw turns to her and hoists a bony finger to his crusty lips: ""Shh.""

I stand there, stunned, watching the freak show of a late-stage marriage that will almost certainly end in either divorce or an episode of Unsolved Mysteries.

As they walk away, I hear the wife saying ""Don't ever talk to me like that again in front of people!""

Brokaw returned later that night to throw his dirty towels at me and demand a fresh set.

My co-workers have reported similar encounters -- again, none of these normal, at least not in such a short span of time for our property.

One guest verbally assaulted my co-worker -- ""I don't know if this is the maid staff's way of getting a laugh by pissing off the customer"" -- because the settings on his television were off.

Another guest moved rooms *six times. SIX TIMES. SIX. TIMES.* My coworker was visibly shook detailing the story to me: ""She was super rude and no matter how many times I moved her, I could not make her happy. *Nothing worked.*""

You know the type. They come in looking for problems, and this week, we've had them all. We got your awful mother-in-law. We got your rude grandfather. The influx has been *extraordinarily noticeable* and this ridiculous holiday is my #1 culprit.

It wasn't all bad though, and I'll end with a positive note. One older guest was determined to make me laugh and kept coming up to the desk with jokes that he thought were super clever, even though many of them are played out dad jokes that I've heard a million times. But I could tell he genuinely enjoyed making others smile, which I appreciated, especially the last few days, so I played along.

But this one actually got me. We had a few moments of downtime and this guest approaches the desk, smelling a little boozy from a night out at a nearby steakhouse.

""Okay, so... when Beethoven passed away, he was buried in a churchyard. A couple days later, the town drunk was walking through the cemetery and heard some strange noise coming from the area where Beethoven was buried. Terrified, the drunk ran and got the magistrate to come and listen to it.

When the magistrate arrived, he bent his ear to the grave, listened for a moment, and said, 'Ah, yes, that's Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, being played backwards.'

He listened a while longer: 'There's the Eighth Symphony, and it's backwards, too. There's the Seventh... the Sixth... the Fifth...""

'Backwards?' asked the drunk. 'Why?'

Suddenly the realization of what was happening dawned on the magistrate. He stood up and announced: 'There's nothing to worry about. It's just Beethoven decomposing.'""

This guest always has a place here.

But the other ones? I hope when the new year hits, they stay far away for another 11 months. I'll take my regulars, my Super Shiny Status members, my ""Just Passing Through"" folks, my weird sketchy locals, *and the occasional Karen.* But this week has been too many in too short of a time period and I need a break.

Have any other properties noticed a change in guest type since Thanksgiving week started?

841,Probably leaving the hotel industry,"So I'm on my last shift right now. The country is in lockdown and our property closes on Dec 1st until Dec 31st.  
I was gonna start at another property in January but due to said lockdown they laid off a couple people and told me they were sorry but wouldn't be hiring me anymore.  
So my choices rn are to either crawl back to my boss and ask them to cancle my notice (which they would probably do) or find something else. And quite frankly, I'm leaning towards the latter.  


Lately guests have been nothing but a pain with 'normal' people far in between, let alone actually pleasent ones. People getting aggressive over them being unable to check travel-restrictions, let alone covid regulations for the country they're entering. People being outright pissed at us for not being allowed to serve breakfast according to government rules (we don't have the staff to supervise the breakfast room or enough place to ensure a certain distance is kept between tables).  
While people were usually somewhat understanding of circumstances before covid, it seems the virus has taken away everyone's common sense aswell. I get everyone is on edge about the pandemic but for f\*\*\*s sake, tone it down, people.

Anyway, back to job hunting for me, I hope everyone is holding up so far. <3",14,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CD1336A0>
842,Its regulated,"So just barley getting to work not even fully awake yet. And the phone rings. 

Front desk... 

Rm 204- yes im trying to make it warmer in here but the thermometer only goes up to 78. 

Fd- yes unfortunately its regulated like that by the fire dept. 

204- you cant tell me that its the fire dept. I was at so and so yesterday and it went up higher. Its your brand that does that. 

Fd- yes ok. Well regardless if its the brand or the fd theres nothing i can do thats as high as it will go. 

204- no dont blame it on the fd its your brand. I was at so and so and it didnt do this. I just wont stay here again. 

Fd- ok well have a good night. 👍 

Already not in the mood due to some of the staff acting the way they did this week. There is literally nothing i can do about it not going higher. Its not my building. Not going to beg someone to come back. As a customer you have every right to refuse the service of a company. It was a third party so she wont be getting any kind of discount. She can stay where she did last time for all i care. Its a hotel for every one person refusing a room theres like 2 more behind you willing to rent the room out. 

Most likely she didnt have it turned on correctly (we get that a lot with these new units) and i would have offered to come look at it. But when youre being that rudely talked to and being cut off i think ill stay down stairs and let the good for nothing asst manager deal with it in the morning. Also would have offered up a blanket but being so irritated id make her come to the desk to get it. We arent a full service hotel and really dont have to take things to a guests room. We can if we have time or choose to.",62,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CCF11130>
843,Feel good story/Pat on the back,"Sorry for the formatting, on mobile.

I have been working in hospitality for 4+ years now. Been following this sub for maybe 2 years. I see a lot of stories that are upsetting and rightfully so. Here’s one that is not as upsetting.

Around Christmas time 2019, an elderly lady walks into my hotel. This is around 10 pm. She seems upset already walking through the doors. So I greet here and start the check in process and ask her what brings her to town, she says she’s surprising her grandson who she hasn’t seen in about 3 or 4 years (some of the minor details are fuzzy). She then started to vent about how terrible traveling is, especially when you’re alone. She goes on and says that she was trying to get some last minute gifts together for her grandson (cake, card, etc.) but because her flight was so delayed she didn’t have any time to get the items together. So I sympathized with the elderly woman and finished the check in and sent her up to her room. This was before covid so that means I had a coworker working the desk with with. That means I am able to leave the desk. So without saying anything to the grandma, I went to a 24 hour grocery store near the hotel, and picked up a chocolate cake for her. I know I could have told her about it but I have a soft spot for grandmas what can I say. I came back to the hotel and ran up to her room knocked on her door and handed her the cake. I got the warmest hug i’ve ever received. She checked out the next morning before I got there and she left me a nice note and said I was the nicest hotel employee she’s ever met. I still carry the note around with me in my wallet to this day. So it goes to show, that even though there are really shitty guests, one can leave such an imprint on you that it will last a lifetime.",5,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CCF11D90>
844,A nice guest and a not so nice guest,"Thanksgiving was dead as I worked the 3-11pm shift. I had 3 check-ins all within the same half hour. All the laundry was done so basically I just sat around watching HBO Max. It was too dead I didn't like it as much as I thought I would. The air was too still I strangely missed the crazy (not really).

Today however has been much busier. Earlier I had a mother and son check in and they made me laugh. I process their check-in and get to the vehicle information and the mother starts giving me the info then the son chimes in.

M: Yes its a white Carolla with ...

S: It's really old.

M: It's not that old.

S: It came out of 2016.

M: It's younger than you.

S: So, My mom's really old too. 

Me and the mom laugh and she finishes giving me the info. The son continues on about the tire strength and how the car can carry everything anywhere. He told me they visited his grandma for thanksgiving and they were headed back to California. It made me chuckle and made me think how different today is than yesterday.

Conversely, a bit later a guest I checked in came back to the desk with the complaint face I recognize on anyone as soon as she enters the lobby. She informed me she found a hair in her sheets and proceeded to show me one strand of hair from multiple angles. I apologize and tell her I'll pass the info onto housekeeping. She asks for fresh sheets which I bring over a few minutes later.

I get there and knock and she answers so quickly I'm a bit startled. All the sheets, pillows, pillow protectors, pillow cases, and blankets are all separately pilled on the floor and her husband in lying on a bare mattress watching TV as if he didn't have a care in the world. She looks at me for a moment as I hold out the sheets for her and she says 

G: Aren't you going to make our beds for us?

Me: Due to our COVID restrictions I can't enter occupied rooms in order to protect the health of our guests and staff. 

G: Well that's convenient ... for you. OK just give me the sheets.

Me: I apologize again Ma'am is there anything else I can do for you.

G: Yeah clean your rooms properly since you're so picky about disease. 

I expected her to ask for a bag for the other linens or help removing them but OK. So now I expect she'll just make a pile outside her door which is what she does. I pick those up and take them to the laundry and a few minutes later she shows up at the desk.

G: So I guess if you're hiring I can get a job here making beds.

Me: *blank smile* would you like an application?

G: I suppose I can ask for a discount for the inconvenience.

I offer 25% which is often low ball for people who complain excessively but she didn't quite seem that way to me just tired maybe. Surprisingly she accepted 25% immediately. Usually they'll want at least 50% but usually a full refund--anything less is a slap to their face. 

As I was processing the refund she wound down a bit and said I suppose we're having staffing issues which is somewhat true we had a housekeeper leave last week without notice but we have enough people so its not an utter tragedy for us. We chatted for a bit and hopefully we avoided a corporate complaint. I notated everything in her folio in case there is a complaint.",24,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CCF11190>
845,Housekeeping requests rant,"My hotel is one of the few left where you still have to request housekeeping to have it done because of covid. And I am tired of guests getting mad at me for their housekeeping request not getting done.

Especially when it’s someone who called yesterday requesting it, I put in our system, then they call me back the next day complaining that it didn’t get done. When I know for a fact I put it in. 

All I can do is apologize, assure them that it will be done tomorrow, and bring them whatever they may need in the meantime. 
And then when it doesn’t get done the second time they ask, they are very upset by this point. It’s frustrating.

I’ve been a housekeeper, so I know how it is especially when you have like 20 checkouts to clean and you end up working 10+ hours. But stayovers don’t take that long. Especially when it’s just a refresh where they just want their towels and trash taken out, that only takes like 2 minutes. There’s no more than 5 stay over requests a day. It’s not my fault, I’m doing my part and I get it taken out on me anyway. 

I know better communication will help this, I’ve brought it up before to management and they seemed kinda offended because housekeeping works so hard and stuff. But we have new management now so it’s worth bringing up again. Rant over, that is all. :)",35,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CCF11A30>
846,I don’t think I should work Hospitality anymore.,"Sorry for formatting, on mobile.

I’ve worked in hotels for just under 10 years now. It was a job I really didn’t think I would like when I started but ended up loving it and making guests happy and all that lovely stuff. The crap guests were few and far between and management was pretty good. NOW, every day is a constant struggle to keep a smile and be nice to guests. Constantly, being berated for stuff out of my control, management so stuck in their ways (been doing it for 30 years) they don’t understand that procedures and policies need changed or updated. I am a Front Desk Manager that is treated like an Agent (The GM insists on doing scheduling and ordering and replying to guests surveys).

I just came back from a 5 day vacation hoping to stave off burn out but all it did was solidify that I no longer have it in me to be like the wonderful agents or managers I encountered as a guest. 

Sorry, just needed to vent.",77,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CCF11850>
847,No shows,"Has your entire team ever quit in one month? That is not something I wish on anyone.  Because everyone knows, that is where you get so much overtime you have 2 days off in a month.

Well, the topping on this shit show cake is a medical note until December, from the only surviving crew that's not management. The note says to stay off work until December. 

Should he feel guilty in using the doctors note to heal or should he work the holiday week while injured? 

The FDM and GM are the only ones working at the moment. They've asked surviving co-worker written notice of when he plans to return to work. He told the FDM that he might work the weekend part time. But now he's worried about working against a doctors order. 

He wants to stay off work because of the injury and the doctor order, but he doesn't want to put it on the management to work all week. 

What should he do?",32,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CCF117F0>

849,ELEVATOR,"
Our elevator was down on THANKSGIVING. 

So just starting a list of ways someone (LOOKIN AT YOU ROOM 123!) can put an elevator out of service for 24 hours and essentially ruin a bunch of families thanksgiving plans. People HATE when the elevator is down. “What? You mean I have to use the stairs? With my own LEGGGS?”

*disclaimer: the bottle cap incident is usual but our elevator being out of service is…. routine. Consistent. Very consistent. I RARELY use the elevator like only with cart or crib. 



[BOTTLE CAP!!!](https://imgur.com/a/PvEqdFU)

TL;DR: guest put bottle cap to hold elevator door open and (hopefully) forgot to remove it which put our elevator out of service for 24 hours over thanksgiving.",16,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CCF113A0>
850,Don’t forget your drugs,"I love the night audit shift. Never know what you are going to see.

A guest came to the lobby around 1am to add her boyfriend to her room. This particular guest has been warned about unregistered guests after quiet hours and excessive traffic. Had to remind her to put on a mask (our state still has mandates in place). She sets her purse on the small table in the lobby and started pulling stuff out, searching for her mask while complaining the entire time. Finally finds it and adds her boyfriend’s ID to the room. Packs up her purse and leaves while still grumbling about the mask. 20 minutes or so later I walk past the table to go outside and smoke and notice what looks like a bit of clear plastic sitting on the table. Pick it up and it turns out to be a plastic baggie of meth! Manager lives on site so I called her. She came over and confirmed it was in fact meth. Called the non emergency number and they sent someone to pick it up. Manager immediately placed her on the DNR. 

The next morning she came up to try to extend. When she was told they couldn’t do so because she was marked DNR she started yelling that she put her boyfriend on the room so why was she in trouble. My manager, hearing her yelling and cussing at the morning girl, stepped out of the back office and told her “Yes you added him. But next time make sure you don’t forget to take your freaking meth with you when you leave!”",22,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CCF11610>
851,Work place safety,I'm always reminded by new employees that get hired how they're surprised the hotel doesn't have security. New night audit hires are made unaware of how unsafe it is during audit and they end up quitting and the high turnover is blamed on poor leadership which is trying to point the finger at the rather than employees just gtfo to some place that cares about their safety. Does anyone's location deal with these issues? I've talked to corporate about these issues and the guy basically laughed at me when I explained to him my traumatic experiences and told me if I don't feel safe I should just probably quit and denying me and my coworkers the right to a safe work area. Quitting doesn't make sense since im the forced to do full time night audit due to being understaffed. Could use advice.,19,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CCF11FA0>
852,PSA: Please make sure your pets aren’t too smart…!,"Warning: mobile and also 5am for me, figured I would say this story on my shift. I work at a Somfort Cuites that allows pets, mostly keeping them to the 1st floor. Lots of folks were visiting for Thanksgiving, several having pets as I assume just like myself they consider them family to bring along for the holiday. Queue in a family that gets two rooms, coming in as a walk-in from a RV.

These folks get two rooms with two dogs in each room. Sounds lovely, lots of furry friends to get to know! I get them checked in fine, they come through the lobby holding a few and walking others on leashes. 

A hour later, as I go to check in someone on a reservation, one of the smaller dogs comes just walking through the lobby, looking around like it was lost. Confused myself as I had only just seen the owners leave for dinner presumably, I managed to follow the dog down to the other entrance and catch it. I go back to the lobby and finish checking in these others folks and as they start to leave I go to and find the room they were in. As I approach the door opens and suddenly two more dogs peek out, no human in sight, and then rush out the room and down the hall!

For the next half hour myself and two other guests work to corral these dogs back to their room, finally getting them back in and closing the door. The owners show up right as I’m done (having called them twice during this situation) and profusely apologizing. Apparently one of the dogs was so sick of not being around their owners he learnt how to open the door.

Thankfully these dogs were smart. They were able to get outside (thanks to automatic doors) and knew the RV meant their owners, so would go back and forth between the RV and their room entrance until they all were in the hall and I was able to close off the hall with a door we had there.

I’m so thankful someone didn’t lose their fur babies today, but a reminder: this is why we ask you don’t leave your pets alone!",56,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CCF11340>
853,A Pile-up of Recent Annoyances,"Alright, quick backstory. I work for a motel in the middle of the Land of Enchantment but we don't take regular customers--we serve as a dormitory for railroad employees. This is a 157 room property and we average about 140 check-ins a day. (The way the dorm is set up is the rails check in and stay on average for 11-13 hours to sleep and rest, and then they check-out to go back to work.) We run 24/7. I'm the night auditor from Wednesday to Saturday nights.

Anyway, the railroaders have nothing to do with the recent annoyances that prompted this rant. Most of the time the guys are fine to deal with, sometimes they get snippy about where they get sent since a lot of them have preferences on where to go and we normally can accommodate them unless we're super busy and/or short-staffed, which leads me to the point of this rant.

I swear, there's something in the water of the building. Either that, or it's cursed (it is definitely haunted). We have an extremely high turnover rate for the housekeepers and we just lost two of them this week. A couple of weeks ago one of these housekeepers was slacking off and taking her sweet, sweet, sweet time with cleaning the rooms and calling them in when she's done. I had 4 housekeepers and the housekeeping ""supervisor"" whose job is to help with the laundry, inspect rooms, and keep track of the housekeepers. One of these housekeepers is a guy that's also cross-trained on the desk and the night audit process. He didn't have much to do, so at 3am he offered to give me a lunch break. I gladly accepted the offer, got food, and sat down in the corner behind the counter, so I was still up front and able to see everything going on.

The next night, both he and I get letters from the assistant manager (not the full on GM, just the assistant!) where she berated us for this action, and also not keeping track of the housekeepers and how we need to put our feet down and be assertive and boss them around to make sure they do their work. She told us, ""You don't need any help when you're up at the desk, unless you have to use the restroom."" Let that sink in. She basically told us we don't need our lunch breaks. Naturally, I was upset about getting this letter. She also scolded us for the fact that when he and I left that morning there were 50 dirty rooms. Mind you, most of these 50 rooms had checked out within the last 2 hours and even if my guy hadn't given me a break he wouldn't have made much of a difference. 

He and I went around asking the other desk clerks whether we were in the wrong for the lunch break ""infraction"" and also clarified whether we truly needed to watch the housekeepers like a hawk. They all said that yes, it was fine to take a lunch break and have someone cover us; as for the housekeepers, the housekeepers never listen to us and we only should be worried about them if they haven't called a room in like 2 hours. I went home and asked my mom -- she used to be the GM of the property from 2003 to 2017ish -- and she said, ""Uhhhhh if the AGM is telling you that a lunch break isn't allowed, she's breaking the law. Talk to the GM about it to make sure you're all on the same page.""

This assistant manager has only been so since July. We had both applied for the position and even though I had major seniority over her (been here 12 years versus her 4 years) and am cross-trained in all departments except maintenance, she was the one that got the job. Apparently the one flaw that cost me the promotion was that I'm way too nice (""her kind heart might get in the way of properly disciplining the employees"" or something like that, my GM let me look at corporate's interview notes because I wanted to know what I did wrong). I'm honestly still a little bitter about it, lol. I took this woman's place when she got promoted and since then it's been a wave of passive-aggressive notes of her being nitpicky about the work.

Honestly, what with that letter and last night only having 2 housekeepers and tons of dirty rooms, and lots of check-ins.... I'm way too overwhelmed, and I don't know how to bring up to my GM the letter and my feelings about how if I'm doing something wrong, I would like to be told directly either in-person or in a text. I don't feel like I need to leave this place and look elsewhere, I'm okay with this job most of the time and besides, even if I left, I don't trust anyone to do the night audit half as well (not to toot my own horn or anything but 99% of the time I don't get any complaints about my paperwork and book closing).

I just needed to post this in hopes that someone will understand.",17,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CCF11760>
854,First time for everything,"So a gentleman walks in wanting to book a room, cool. He only has a Costco membership as ID and isn't liking that its Helliott policy to see government ID, not cool, but his girlfriend is with him and has ID, cool. Mind you, this is after arguing about why I can't lower the price from our ""BEST"" available rate, had to explain how room rates and averages work, and he settled on saving money by staying for three nights ($159, $179, $159) instead of just one ($159). Not my business how he spends his money.

So I start making this reservation, everything is going smoothly until I go to check them in and finally save this reservation. It will not go through. The system is literally absolutely refusing to let me book them and it does not tell me why or anything, there is nothing I can click, nothing I can change, I simply can not MAKE the reservation, much less check them in. Me: Me Douche Nozzle: DN Unfortunate Girlfriend: UG

Me: ""So I really don't know what to say, in my over three years in hospitality I have ***NEVER*** had this happen before but the system is having an error and refusing to let me book this room, I've clicked all my buttons, tried a second reservation, but no matter what I do it will not save it, and I can not check you in. I'm so incredibly sorry""

DN: ""So just make another one""

Me: ""yes absolutely, I've actually tried twice now, once with all three nights and once with just one night, and both times it was saying the same thing ""Reservation create error, Cannot create Reservation #XXXXXX-Doe, Jane"" and that is all it is telling me. I've honestly tried everything I can to get this sorted for your guys to get you in bed, but the best I can do to help you at this point is to help you find another hotel. I'm going to have to call tech support and have them fix this which could take as few as a couple hours, but most likely won't be fixed for a couple of days based on my experience. Again, I'm so incredibly sorry, if I could help you I would but there is not much more I can do.""

DN: ""So why don't you just make the reservation...?""

UG rolling her eyes and looking at me like ""I'm sorry he's stupid""

Me: ""Again, I've tried a couple of times now and the system literally will not let me. I've ***NEVER*** seen this before and I'm really sorry, but I would highly recommend finding another hotel for the night.""

DN pulls out his phone and makes a call, my desk starts ringing and I seriously give him the ""WTAF"" face, he tells me its him and I'm just standing here like ....? Cool but I can actually see you so why? Basically we go in this circle of ""I want a reservation"" and ""my system literally won't LET me make a reservation"" for a couple of minutes before UG pulls her phone out

UG: ""The place we stayed at last time has rooms available for cheaper anyway hun, lets just go back there, its okay, these things happen""

DN: ""Or I mean she could just give me a reservation""

UG: ""Honey, she's telling you she can't, not even that she doesn't want to, but her computer won't let her.""

On their way out the door I got a ""we'll be talking to Helliott"" from him while she turned around and shook her head at me",25,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CD106D00>
855,Happy thanksgiving,"I only had 8 more arrivals when I came in for my p.m shift tonight, so I figured it would be a pretty laid back night.

I had a lady come to check in. She seems nice, We exchanged the usual “how are you?”’s. She says she’s good, she just got off work and seems to be in a hurry. 

L: just checking in

Me: okay I just need to see your I.d please

L:I don’t have it but I have my work badge. 

It had her name and picture on it so I go ahead and make an exception. I confirm the details on her reservation with her. 

Me: okay I’ll need to swipe your card for incidentals

L: *scoffs* I don’t have that on me either

Me: It looks like there isn’t a card on file so unfortunately I can’t check you in. Also it is hotel policy to have an I.D and credit card to check in. 

L: I don’t understand this has never happened to me before!! I am a shiny and my card number is on my app.

Me: Yes I’m not sure why your card isn’t on the reservation

L: *shows me her member app on her phone* I have my card on my shiny profile can’t I just do a mobile check in then?

Me: I suppose you can try that

L: There I did it can I get my key now

Me: I’m sorry but it still won’t let me process your check in, since there isn’t a card on your reservation

L: This didn’t happen last time I don’t understand!!!!

At this point I’m shaking because I’m sensitive and can feel the angry energy she’s directing towards me. I almost wanted to tell her that she can stay somewhere else if she wants, since this is so inconvenient to her, but I kept my composure.

L: Should I just go to my card and grab my I.D. and card?!

Me: Yes then I can get you checked in right away. 

L: Ugh fine *she finally goes to her car and comes back less than a minute later with her I.D and credit card* 

Me: Thank you

I finally check her in and it takes less than a minute. I could tell she was still irritated with me. This whole interaction was about 10 minutes. 

I don’t understand why she had to make such a big deal about not having her wallet when it was just in her car right outside the whole time?! And what she didn’t understand about her card clearly not being on the reservation and what she expected me to do about it.

However, I suppose this could’ve been avoided if I would’ve just made her get her I.D in the beginning. I figured she might’ve had a rough day and was just trying to help. I know it’s not fun working the holiday, and wanted to make things easier for the both of us, but it ended up just complicated things. Lesson learned. 

We exchanged happy thanksgiving to eachother at the end of the interaction. She still gave me attitude, but I hope she knows I tried my best to help her, and maybe it wasn’t entirely my fault she was in a bad mood. I know the holidays can be tough for some people, so I hope her night improved.

Also, it turns out her card wasn’t on the reservation because she made the reservation over the phone and got a special rate. And whoever made it didn’t bother to get her card information. So that’s that.",19,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CD106EE0>
856,Why the EFF were we so busy today?!,"More of a hypothetical because I know why we were busy: our city had a football game today so everybody HAS to come watch it in person and we are next to a mall (share a parking lot with it) and I guess people want to get their Black Friday shopping done tomorrow.

But still. Every time somebody came to check in, I just wanted to say “You do realize we’re still in a pandemic AND it’s a holiday? GO. HOME.”

We had three front desk agents working tonight at 90% occupancy and we were still nonstop for most of the night. Room service orders (yes, our hotel has brought back room service) were backed up so we were quoting about 1 hour delivery times but we haven’t hired room service attendants so our bellmen (which we only had one tonight) have to do those, assist with check-ins, and housekeeping calls (extra towels, bathroom amenities, etc).

Speaking of which, why do you need new towels if you’ve only been here two days?! I wash my bath towel once a week and I feel sufficiently clean. Unless I’m outing myself as a slob right now? How often should you switch out your towels?!

I have to be back tomorrow at 3 and I am NOT looking forward to trying to find parking tomorrow. It will be a madhouse.",29,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CD106970>
857,Happy Thanksgiving...NOT,"One would think that with it being a major holiday that it would be pretty slow. From my personal experience it has been. However, this is the first time working on Thanksgiving Day in downtown Chicago. I was so thrilled to see that we had less than 20 arrivals and that today would be a delicious piece of pumpkin pie.

I was wrong. Dead wrong. So wrong in fact, that I may just never be right again!

I walked in the door at 2;45pm and told my FOM that if he needed to go a few minutes early to spend time with is wife and kids that he could. He didn't luckily as just as he was getting ready to leave at 3:15 he came running up the stairs from the restroom, laughing like the joker but also with a very surprised and confused look on his face. 

He told me that there was a man in the men's room bent over the sink in nothing but a jockstrop. When my FOM told him to leave the man said he owned the hotel and could do whatever he wants.

""Great"" I thought to myself. Its the same guy I threw out the other day who was claiming he also owned the hotel.

Turns out, it was a totally different guy but..associated with the same guest that I have now gotten permission to kick to the curb if he brings in any more crazies. 

My FOM and engineering got the guy out of the restroom and were screaming at him to leave the property and telling me to call 911. 

Now, I am not a 911 caller unless, I absolutely feel it is 100% needed. I felt it wasn't until this guy took a bar stool, turned it back to front. Sat down and dropped his pants. He sat on the chair in the lobby  to the point of where I, and anyone else in the lobby could see his Deepest, Darkest secrets in his fudge tunnel! And while showing his Thanksgiving full moon, he would turn to me and wink a few times. 

I screamed at him to either pull up his pants or GTFO! Then I said ""YOU NEED TO GET YOUR CRAZY ASS OUT OF HERE BEFORE I CALL 911""

He left but less than 10 minutes later he came back and sat on one of the sofas. I again told him to leave and he got up and ran to my elevator just as I was picking up the phone. Instead of calling 911 I called the registered guest to get him out and told the guest that this is 3rd crazy person he was associated with that we had to throw out of here. He claimed they were not associated. and the crazy guy didn't even know the guests first name.  I then looked him dead in the eye and said 

""Um all of these people have been in your room, with your permission, therefore they are associated. You can't play that anymore as this is the 3rd person we have thrown out and the 3rd time you claim they are not associated with you.""

He stopped talking and went back to his room after getting the crazy guy out. About an hour later, another crazy one showed up and went upstairs. If I get any more pyscho, I get to throw them out.

Shortly after this, another guy comes into my lobby asking to charge his phone. He then began to say that Darth Vader was his father and that Darth threw him into the matrix.

""Great! another 504 crazy."" Not this time.  Just as I was about to ask him leave the resident homeless guy walked into the lobby and they started their Schizogiving rants to one another. Or maybe it was Thankschizing I yelled at them to get out and they are still going at it until, I finally did call 911 and got them the hell out. (the homeless guy I am yelling at every single day.)

A bit later, I had a toilet overflow so bad that it looked like it was spewing chunks of Stuffing. Funny thing is, no one had done anything but pee. 

It was the moment I come back from the toilet situation that I see the naked guy heading back toward the hotel. He walks as far as the front door. Sees me glaring at him. I get up from my desk and run toward the front doors. He turned and ran away. 

That's all the major stuff but a few minor things.

\*The hookers who keep extending and I keep fighting with in regards to food deliveries, extended again. 

\*The crazy smoking complaint lady who has now been here for over 5 months complained about someone on her floor smoking again when she is the only one there. She wants to Exchange Keifer drinks for free nights.  

\*An asian trans woman went nuts on me because we do not provide slippers.

\*one of the guests of 504 another one accidentally grabbed the wrong food order from the table where they are delivered just as the true owner was coming down and an arugument ensued.

And this isn't even all of it!

858,Why outside callers find me so annoying : a story about being cautious.,"I have a golden rule. You call, ask to be transferred, I will NOT transfer you without both room number AND name. I get pissed out a LOT for this by callers, but frankly...I don't care. Here's why.

I work at a motel/hotel, and we have people CONSTANTLY trying to track down people that don't want to be found that essentially hide here.

I've had people come looking for guests that literally haven't even checked in yet.  
I've had callers pretend to be police officers.  
I've had people show up demanding spare room keys.  
I've had people demand spare room keys, somehow get one, and go into a room that wasn't theirs in order to...god knows what with another guest staying in that room.

Unless you have the room number AND the name (and your name is on the itinerary), I simply say I'm unable to assist them without that information and wish them a nice rest of their day. I'd rather a guest be angry that they missed a call than a guest be injured or worse because I've given someone the means to track them down when they don't want to be found.

If they've been able to let you know they're here, they can also let you know their room number.If you're the ""police"" and you know someone is here, then you can surely send the local PD to perform a welfare check.

Bottom line: Safety of my guests is my absolute priority. Your pissy attitude can and will not offend me in that regard.",38,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CD106F10>
859,Better safe than sorry,"It's about 10 minutes into my shift. My manager is still hanging out in his office all of 20 feet from me and I'm just shooting the shit with my coworker. A lady walks in with two kids (maybe 6-9 years old?) to check in. I start getting her taken care of at my PC and she's super nice! ""Could I see your ID, please?"" ""Absolutely!"" That kind of thing. It's all going great until I give her her keys.

RG = Rude Guest; PG = Polite Guest; GM = Manager; Me = Me

RG: Is this for both rooms?

Me: Oh, I'm sorry! I thought I only saw one room under your name, but that very well could have been a mistake on my part. (A mistake I've never made, but there's a first time for everything)

I checked the list of reservations, searched her name for that day and all future dates, checked the control panel (if you're wondering, yes, we still use OPERA) and got nothing. 

Me: I'm really sorry, but I'm not seeing another reservation. Is it possible that it's under someone else's name?

RG: NO! *I* booked and paid for it for my sister, PG. And I'd like adjoining rooms with her, too. 

I check for traces, comments, accompanying parties, etc. and don't see anything, let alone this lady's name. There's also not a phone number on the reservation because it's booked through an OTA and they only share so much information with us so I can't call PG to see if it's okay to give RG her keys. 

Me: Well, I'm sorry but I'm not seeing your name anywhere on PG's reservation. It's just a safety precaution. I *can* go ahead and check to see if we have any adjoining rooms available. 

I check. We do. I tell her this.

RG: \*Scoffs\* Well, we won't be coming back here again. 

My manager has undoubtedly heard the entirety of our exchange. There have been plenty of times I've been checking a guest in or they've had a question and he's jumped in to help or provide a suggestion or whatnot. Hearing this lady threaten to not come back, he hops out of his chair and comes up to the desk.

GM: Hi, ma'am! I heard you said you won't come back to our hotel! Can I ask why that is?

RG: Well, she's saying I only have one room and I had to insist on getting adjoining rooms with my sister. 

GM: -Proceeds to rehash what I said about safety, being unable to give her the other room's keys, etc.- 

Whether it was my manager's more confident demeanor, seeing someone in an apparent position of power, or someone ""more adult"" (I'm 21 but look 16-18), something about my manager talking to this lady satiated her bloodlust. She stormed off to her room with her kids and my coworker, manager, and I had a good laugh about the ridiculous lady as I put an alert on her reservation for the daytime supervisor, being sure to state that GM is aware of the situation and that no compensation is required.

Fast forward a couple of hours later when PG comes to check in. Everything goes well with her, too; she's super kind and I get her checked in really efficiently. 

Me: Alright! And before I let you go, we had a request from a Ms. RG earlier. She asked about having adjoining rooms with you. Nothing seemed odd or suspicious about her request or behavior, but I'm just supposed to confirm that that's okay for your safety. 

PG: Oh, absolutely! She's my sister! I appreciate you checking though. I'd much rather be safe than sorry!",3,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CD106670>

You know when you really gotta shit at work but since you are working the front desk you gotta wait until the time is right. You know that feeling with your turd is crowning,  “turtle-heading” if you will? Well that was happening to me. So I put the sign up that I will be stepping away and ran up them stairs like I was rocky or some shit.

I hate being the only one at the desk when I gotta take a shit, I just know some shits gonna happen when I’m away (pun intended lol) 

I come down the steps now refreshed, feeling like a new man. Some grumpy lady is at the desk, and the phone has been ringing like crazy. I check the lady in first cause she was so pissed;

Me: “sorry I just had to go to the bathroom? I left the sign at the desk and I’m the only one here…” 

BD: “whatever…” *glares at me for the entire check in process*

*phone is still fucking ringing* 

*I answer the phone”

Caller: *something* *something* I was about to call the cops?”

Me: “I’m sorry WHAT is going on??”

Caller: “There is a disabled person trying to check in, and she’s been there for 5 mins now! No one was at the front desk and I am about to call the cops!”

Me: “ummmm… there was a sign at the desk saying I was stepping away. I had to go to the bathroom… I am the only one at the desk and step away to go potty sometimes”(wanted to say shit but didn’t want to get a complaint)

I didn’t let him say anything and hung up on that annoying ho. Today is a holiday I would rather be with my family and friends then be at this shit hole helping shitty customers dealing with their shitty attitudes just cause I wanted to take a SHIT!

861,Thanksgiving day,"Guess who’s working today me. 

I get a call from a guest saying that his hold turned into a posted charge when it wasn’t supposed to. I open the reservation. 

Me: ok, so there was only one card given, ending in xxx for x.xx amount. 

Him: it was only supposed to be a hold. 

Me: ok, if there is another card you want to ise to pay for the room, at this point we would need a credit card authorization form filled out. 

Man: are you serious?

Me: yes. 

Man: why can’t you just use the card on the reservation?

Me: the card that is given at the time of booking is just to hold the room. Payment is required at check in, or a credit authorization needs to be filled out. 

Man: well i’m not paying this. 

Me: ok, then we qould just need whoever is paying to contact us to fill out and send the form. 

Man: i’m not doing that. I was told it was just a hold. Why would you charge it?

I look thru the res and i see i checked him in. 

Me: at check in valid id and a form of payment is always asked for, but the card can always be changed as long as it is physically present or the form is filled out. 

Man: well you need to use the card that was file. 

Me: for security reasons payment is required to be present at check in so we can verify it. 

Man: well i’m not paying. 

Me: whoever is paying would need to contact us. 

Man: why can’t you do it?

Me: sir, i’m not sure who is supposed to be paying. 

Man: it was already paid for!

Me: it was not. The card that was taken at the time of booking is just to hold the room. 

At this point he hung up. 

Happy Thanksgiving.",46,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CD106880>

863,OW MY HEAD!!!!,"( I apologize doing my format on my phone yada yada....)

 This literally happened just now.
 I get a call from somebody saying they have a guess at my hotel but they need to be at the hotel in Miami. I think wow that's kind of interesting you're a whole freaking country on the other side I'm not in Miami I'm on the opposite side I'm on the West Coast. The lady on the phone then proceeds to give me a confirmation number that has nothing to do with any of our confirmation numbers because we do not use letters in our confirmation.

I tell her ma'am we don't use letters she again gives me the confirmation I'm like ma'am that's fine we don't use letters you probably booked through a 3rd party. She then tells me' ""well I clicked on Hennesy Sweets.""  And I asked her ""ma'am was that the 1st thing that showed up on your search?"" She says yes. 

 Now begins the throbbing in my head....

I tell her ma'am that most likely was a 3rd party reservation that you created you did not create with smalltin.com do you know the website did what you created. She of course doesn't know the website she says she has an email and I tell her what is that email's address. She ran off the email's address which is a bunch of numbers and then hotel values.com. I've never heard of it so I say ma'am what you need to do is scroll down to the bottom and there should be an 800 number to call. She tells me yeah she called the number that was on here I go ma'am that's our hotel most likely you'll need to call an 800 number that's all the way down at the bottom of the reservation email. 

She asked me to look up to make sure to see if that guess this year who is Joe Smith. I look there is no Joseph Smith she says maybe it's under Joseph Smith. Granted this isn't his real name the names have been changed to protect the innocent. 

I can tell her ma'am we do not have any Smiths here at all. She then tries to give me the confirmation number again my poor wall now has a whole big dent in there.  I again tell her ma'am we do not use letters in our confirmation number you need to contact the 1 800 number at the bottom of your email and talk to them. Granted she's been nice it's just that I don't think she's getting my point that I can't help her because we have no one by that name we do not have that confirmation number and most likely the gentleman is at a different property. And with that she says thank you and hangs up.  But at the whole time I'm just thinking ma'am I don't understand how missing no letters in our confirmation and that last name doesn't exist in my reservations it still was a 10 minute conversation of having to tell her how to do everything. I hope she finds Mr. Joe Smith.",16,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CD106940>
864,Most Disturbing Phone Call Ever,"Obligatory on mobile so apologies for any formatting errors. For this story it’s important to note I am a younger woman (20) and you can tell that by my voice. So, about a couple months ago I’m working my audit shift and it’s about 6 AM and I get a phone call from an external number. This is how it goes:

Me: Thanks for calling my hotel. How can I help you?

Creepy Guy (CG): Hi! I am gonna be staying with you guys soon and was wondering if there is a Walmart near the hotel.

Me: No, but there is an Albertsons nearby.

CG: Oh okay, so if you aren’t busy I was wondering if you could just help me out with some fashion advice? I have a 12 year old daughter and I just need some help.

Naively I thought this was an innocent phone call from a dad asking for fashion advice for his daughter. I don’t know why I didn’t just end the call there, I was tired and just assumed he didn’t have ill intentions. That was dumb of me, I know.

Me: Um, I can answer a quick question what’s up?

CG: So we are gonna be visiting family for a nice dinner and I bought my daughter a black dress and just wanted to know what kind of stockings would look best with black.

Me: Probably tan or white.

CG: Okay, so do you think it would be weird if I asked my 12-year-old daughter to wear her moms shoes and I called her sexy?

Me: You are a disgusting person. *hangs up*

I was a bit shaken up. I usually can handle calls that are creepy but the fact it was about his 12-year-old daughter really disturbed me. I just hoped it was some sort of sick troll.

Well tonight around 1 AM I get a phone call and this is how it went:

Me: Thanks for calling my hotel. How can I help you?

CG: Hi! I am gonna be staying with you guys soon and was wondering if there is a Walmart near the hotel.

I immediately recognized his voice and that line he used.

Me: *immediate shift in voice tone* Nope. Let me guess, you need stockings for your daughter.

CG: Okay, let me explain. So, I-

Me: No, I’ve got this exact phone call from you. I hope you don’t actually have any children.

CG: I do, I-

Me: Well then I fear for their safety. You are a disgusting creep and you should be ashamed. *transfers him to non-emergency dispatch*

Please note we do not have caller ID and I have told my AGM this before so I don’t know if much can be done about this. I am kinda shaken up again since I worry that this creep may actually have a daughter.

TL;DR: Got a creepy phone call from a guy calling his daughter sexy. He calls again and after calling him disgusting I transfer him to the police department.",93,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CD1065E0>
865,Sad and unjust reality,"My mom has worked in the hotel industry for some years now.  She has been a housekeeper for different hotels, but she’s never been a manager.  She was a food server before.  She is the reason why I always love to tip generously to our servers knowing even with a little generosity would make a huge difference in their daily experiences.
Recently, I learned from her stories that most of the time, when the guests leave the tips for their housekeepers, the money wouldn’t get to the housekeepers.  It’s either the managers or the houseman would steal the tips money before the housekeepers arrival.  In the beginning, she just thought guests never leave tips.  But later on, she found it’s not it.  It’s the manager and houseman (rarely, other housekeepers) stealing her tips.  It was hard for her in the beginning.  However, as time gone by, and knowing this happens not just to her but to everyone, she just accepts this reality.  But she never let this ugly reality stop her from delivering an excellent experience to the guests.
Now, whenever I leave tips when I check out any rooms, I make sure I hide tips where only the housekeepers would find.  It sounds crazy but I just want people who deserve the tips get them.",44,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CD106820>
866,Parking lot safety discourse,"*(As usual, any property or guest names mentioned were changed to protect the innocent.)*

So a few months ago, I came in for my night shift and not too long after, I had a guest walk in, we'll just call them Wendy McChickenjoy.

So I go through the usual motions for a walk-in: Quote rate, explain the security deposit that must be under a cred or deb card under their name, and they agree to all of that and present their card and matching ID to me.

However, while I'm processing their booking, they ask me if their car will be safe here.
- - - - 
Now, a little background. The property I work at is basically a motel along a major street in a suburban California neighborhood. In the three years I have worked here I have never heard of any incidents of vehicle break-ins. Not even when we've had guests park Porsches, Lamborghinis, or Nissan GT-Rs. But even then, there's some red tape preventing me from just saying ""yeah, your vehicle will be safe here.""

*(Note: I Am Not A Lawyer, this is just what I've been taught in work training. Also this seems to be US-specific; things may be different in other countries.)*

You see, as explained in a training video my GM made us watch a week or two prior to this, hotels have no liability when it comes to what happens to a guest's self-parked vehicle in our parking lot. If something happens to a guest's vehicle, the hotel will not cover the damages, the guest has to turn to their own insurance to take care of that. Guests who are concerned that stuff could be taken from their car are typically advised to take any valuables out of their car and carry those things into their rooms. 

And yes, while front desk staff are required to walk the property from time to time during their shifts to make sure things throughout the hallways are okay and that all staff doors are locked, they can't be prowling the property all 8 hours because they have other things to do, like check in guests, check out guests, deal with guest complaint number 394 quadrillion, use the bathroom, eat, etc. And sadly no, we don't have a security team on duty. We do have lights in the parking lot as well as security cameras, but that's still not a guarantee of vehicle safety and cameras only really help catch criminals that have already done the act, not stop them in the first place.

If I were to tell Wendy that yes, their car would be safe here, then something happened to their vehicle -- for example, their car gets broken into, their wallet full of credit cards gets stolen, and their car stereo was hacked to perpetually play Milli Vanilli -- then the hotel could be held liable for the damages, as we promised that Bad Thing wouldn't happen to their car, and then Bad Thing happened anyway, making us look like a bunch of filthy liars.

Now if we did valet parking, then yes the hotel would have some degree of responsibility for what happens with a guest's vehicle, since the employees are being entrusted with guests' cars and keys.
- - - -
Anyways, back to my conversation with Wendy. So I explain to them that unfortunately, we cannot make any promises that their vehicle would be safe, and - as mentioned above - I told them that they should take all valuables in their car and bring it into their hypothetical room.

They didn't accept this for an answer, and kept trying to get me to reassure them that their vehicle would be safe here. They asked me if we've had any recent break-ins. If this neighborhood is safe. Yada yada. I just stand by my stance that I cannot assure them about the safety of their vehicle. I went a bit further, telling them that if they do not feel safe parking their car here, they are welcome to rent somewhere else where they feel safer about their vehicle. 

Now I can empathize with them; a few years ago I was at a shopping center with some friends and when I came back to my car along with the friend I was carpooling, I discovered that my car had been broken into and my friend's backpack was stolen; said backpack had over $1,000 of valuables in it. A harsh lesson learned in not leaving valuables out in the open and especially taking them out of the car and with me if I am able to. I just had to take that L and learn to be better with my valuables; I didn't yell at the people who own the shopping center, let alone sue them, because that would've fixed nothing.

Wendy is not being rude or anything, they were very nice and polite throughout the conversation. But their persistence was certainly getting on my nerves because it was obvious they were trying to fish for a specific answer and get me to check them in. 

After going back and forth between wanting to stay here anyway and wanting to leave, Wendy finally decided to abort their mission of renting here and go away. Thank gods, I don't want revenue from a guest who's going to be asking us questions about the safety of the property every 10 minutes that they're in the room ~~with a lawyer armed with a sniper rifle nearby that shoots lawsuits as bullets~~.

So, let that be an inconvenient, but necessary lesson, folks. Your car that you park at a hotel isn't an extension of your room, so even if a hotel you're staying at seems safe, be sure to take everything you wouldn't want to lose with you into your room for the night.

Anyways, thank you for calling the Cave Inn, no we can't guarantee that if you park your ship here it won't be assaulted by flaming bees. How else may I help you today?",12,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CD106C70>
867,Why I only make a key for people whose names are on the room (or: i can't believe i have to explain this) (WARNING: Blood),"SETTING: 2014, a place in Texas I won't specify.

I come in to work my audit shift, and the AGM - who is generally pretty laid-back - has this ***look*** on his face. The kind of look that does not belong on the face of someone who is generally cheerful. It is a Bad Thing. Concerned, I ask him what's going on, and he quietly and politely informs me that one of our first-floor rooms is out of order.  He also informs me that one of my co-workers - let's call him Bob for the purposes of this story - is no longer my co-worker. (All names falsified, for reasons that will become obvious.)

Because of who I am, my curiosity gets the better of me and I ask him what happened. Weeeeeeell...

Bob was working the PM shift, and a man came into the hotel and approached the front desk, asking for a key to the room where Mrs. Winkledorfer is staying. Bob checks, and she is indeed a guest with us, but his name isn't on the room. The man reassures him that he's the woman's husband, and presents ID confirming this. So Bob makes him a key. Of course, Mr. Winkledorfer can't remember what his room number is, so Bob just goes ahead and reminds him of his room number. What could go wrong, right?

&#x200B;

She was hiding from him.

I got to find out why.

&#x200B;

Did I let on that I'm entirely too curious for my own good? So once the AGM took off to get good and drunk, I decided to make a key to the room and just took a peek inside, just to see why the room was out of order. Broken lamp or something, I figured. No intention of actually entering, just curious to see how long it would take to fix things. We had a tendency to sell out, after all.

Oh me oh my.

People.

The room looked like Dracula and Rorschach decided to get freaky in there. There was...I mean, there was definitely breakage, and it was definitely worse than I expected, but that wasn't what struck me. There was blood. There was ***a lot of blood***. Floor. Walls. Curtains. Bathroom. Bed. It was really, *really* bad. Naturally, I did not go inside. I closed the door again and went to try to focus very very hard on my work to distract me from what I had just seen. It took *months* for us to be able to sell that room again, and I still took great pains not to put anyone in there unless there was absolutely no alternative.

I never found out what happened to that woman, but I'm very, very glad we were right next to a hospital. God help me, I'm not sure if it'd be more kind for her to survive or not. I can never un-see that, Reddit. I've watched corpses being wheeled out of rooms, I've seen people fistfighting in hallways, I've seen rooms smeared with shit, but this...this happened seven years ago and I can still see it in my mind, and I really wish I didn't.

***DO NOT.***

***MAKE KEYS.***

***FOR ANYONE WHO IS NOT LISTED.***

Because 99 times out of 100, you're going to be fine. 99 times out of 100, everything is going to work out and it's perfectly innocent and you'll never hear about it again.

But that one time, you could be destroying a human being.

868,Guests giving a hard time at check in,"I cannot stand it when guests try to challenge me at how i’m to do my job. 

Two days in a row i had reservations where it had one spouse’s name, but not the other, and the other was checking in. I was taught that the person whose name is on the reservation needs to check in. If it’s one name, and they are not at the desk, they can either come out of the car, or they can call me to confirm if i can check someone else in and i add their name. 

Last night an older man came to check in. He gives me the last name, i notice the first is a woman’s. I ask if she’s with him and he asks why. I explain since it’s her name, she has to be here to check in. He scoffs. I explain it’s for security reasons and he mocks me. He leaves and comes back with his wife’s id. “Is that safe enough??”

Same today. A woman comes to check in, gives me the name, res is under a man’s. 

Me: ok, i just need id and a form of a payment. 

Woman: uh oh we never get asked this. 

(Second highest tier mind you, only super shinys and vip can check in without showing id or cc)

Woman: can i use mine?

Me: is this man with you?

Woman: yes

Me: i would need his id. 

A man walks in. 

Woman: she needs your id!

Man: why? We never get asked this! Ever! We’re married!

Me: for security reasons we ask for photo id of the person whose name is on the reservation so we can verify the identity of the person checking in. 

Man: i have never been asked this at this beand before!

He storms out. 

Woman: sorry… he got hit on a motorcycle and has ptsd. 

(Idk what that has to do with this, but it’s not ane excuse? If he can’t handle checking in he needs to add your name)

She brings me the id and i ask again for the form of payment. 

Woman: why can’t you just use the card on file? We never get asked for this. We don’t have the card with us n

Me: at our property we require form of payment to be presented at check in. If you wish to use that card, you can certainly check in on the app instead of with me. 

Woman: well, normally we get an email about echeck in but you didn’t send it to us. 

(Saying that like it’s out fault?)

Me: if you have the app, you can view your stay and do echeck in that way. You don’t necessarily need the email, i don’t believe. 

She loses her patience and shoves a card in my face. 

After about 20 minutes the man comes down. 

Man: i just wanted to apologize for losing my temper. I had a short temper with you. I’m sure you get abuse all the time. 

Me: oh, thank you. 

Man: yeah i apologize for my short temper, but your policy is so silly. I know you’re doing your job, but we never have this problem at any other hotel. 

Me: sir, for security reasons at this property we require id and form of payment at check in. 

He just shakes his head and walks away. 

If every other hotel lets you do that, stay there, instead of standing here and bullying me. 

Maybe it’s harsh to not allow a person’s spouse to check in, but you never know. I’ve had guests who were victims of domestic abuse.

869,When balancing inventory does your hotel prioritize how much the guest is paying or when they booked?,"Basically what the title says: If you need to downgrade a room does the person who paid less get downgraded or does the person who booked later get downgraded? 

I’m asking cause I’m a supervisor at a hotel, which is not a chain so no rewards program. The policy I put in place (which my manager agrees with) is that the person who booked first gets priority, regardless of how much they’re paying. I communicated this to the front desk staff by email and through a posting at the desk, but one of the staff members totally disagrees. Today she overbooked a room and when the other supervisor told her that she couldn’t do that she told the supervisor we could just downgrade whoever paid the least amount.

870,General Manager vs. Housekeepers,"**UPDATE/ADDITIONAL INFO: I am the owner...and I agree with most of you that a ""sting"" won't prove anything either way.**

Ugh! I love everyone I work with at a small hotel and I'm at my wits' end how to deal with this. Any advice would be appreciated!

Upon checkout, general manager goes to the rooms and strips beds or gets towels out of bathrooms so we can get laundry started. I imagine this was started because we were always short on linens and we had ""iffy"" guests so it allowed the room to be inspected very soon after the guest left. After a renovation and price hike, we have plenty of linens and really nice guests so it's no longer necessary but I guess old habits die hard.

The housekeepers swear tips are being taken by the manager. I seriously, seriously doubt this, but I mentioned to the manager that the housekeepers are well-paid and just let them get the laundry. For awhile, this happened but we slipped back into the ""inspect-the-rooms-and-get-laundry-started-early"" routine. Finally I said to manager, ""Look, the HK's don't really want us in the rooms. They're worried about their tips. Just let them go in.""

Manager (always extremely easy-going) was PISSED and insulted and said (rightly so) the manager is the boss and should not be dictated to by housekeepers when and what rooms can be entered. (Manager is NOT SNOBBY but has a point....We also need to do repairs in the mornings.) So the issue just faded into the background for a month or so.

Now housekeepers SWEAR they saw a tip being stolen on Sunday...if anything, at the very worst scenario, I can imagine manager looking because it is nice to know the customers are happy and the housekeepers are making some tips finally, and maybe that's what the housekeeper saw?

Unless there's a repair, I want the manager to basically stay out of the rooms and let the housekeepers do their stuff. But now I don't know how to approach...the manager's radar is already up about this, and I see why the manager is insulted and I certainly cannot picture this manager stealing ANYTHING, but we also ABSOLUTELY CANNOT AFFORD to have the housekeepers quit.

How should this be handled?????",122,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CD106790>

872,Anyone know if this is a scam?,"I’m the new’ish night auditor. I’ve been on about 2 weeks doing solo shifts. Today when starting off there was a note in the MOD report saying a guy called and needs to talk to the GM over a compliance issue with the Audit. I called him and tried to scope the guy out a bit, he had the info ready off the top of his head which was a red flag. But seemed a little legitimate considering he wouldn’t disclose anything with me and had to talk to the GM. I assume if it was truly a scam he’d try squeezing money from someone lower on the totem pole vs the GM but he told me I can verify his number through the hotel website which coincidently couldn’t be reached when I tried. Is this a common scam? If not does that mean I screwed something up? Assuming it’s the my fault if there was a compliance issue.

Update: It ended up being legitimate, it was apparently from a month ago. I thought it was a financial thing but it was just to do with making sure the hotel policies were being upkept. Slightly odd, it was a ""compliance audit"", not ""compliance issue with the audit"" as the memo said. Nearly gave me a damn heart attack.",36,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147C92D0A30>
873,Why do people think we need have a sign that says every policy on it?,"I just had a woman try to check in with a Green Dot card. I apologized, and told her that we do not take Green Dot cards. We only take credit or bank debit cards. She assured me her card was fine because it has her name on it, and I assured her it was not, because it's a Green Dot card. She showed me her name on it, and I politely as I could pointed out that that was not the issue in question, the issue is that it's a Green Dot card.

She then offered her CashApp card, and I had to explain that no, they're not a bank either. When that didn't work, she said, ""I'm not trying to go above you or whatever but can I talk to a manager?"" Now, I would argue that that is exactly what going above you is, but I didn't say that to her. And even though, ""Can I talk to a manager."" May be a ""get what you want"" button at other businesses, it is not here. Especially when I am the manager on duty.

So I informed her that I am the manager on duty, and that our policy stood and we wouldn't be making any exceptions to it. Finally she pulled out what she seemed to think was her trump card.

>Lady- Well, can you show me where it says that?

>Bran- Sure

So I pulled a bus driver, and tapped [the sign.](https://imgur.com/a/cu1V7v5) She read it out loud, so I know she read it. When she got to the third paragraph she got very excited.

>Lady- My name does match!

>Bran- Yes, that's not the issue. The issue is that it's a Green Dot card.

I tapped the sign again where it says Green Dot specifically so she can't even complain that it doesn't mention the kind of card she has. She asked again for me to make an exception, I declined and gave her the name of the next closest hotel.",243,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147C92D0730>
874,Late Night Sharon,"So last night we had one of those guests that was impossible to please. Let's just back up a min to explain. She came down to the Front Desk about 1 pm. I was not clocked in at this time but I was there. She came in to explain that her toilet was giving her issues. We thanked her for reporting it and put a WO in the system. She went back to her room and all was quite until about 6pm (Which of course by now I was on the clock) She came back down and said ""IF our toilet isn't fixed we need to move our room. I called Maintenance and got the tech. Warned him of a possible water event as the guest was very concerned. So the toilet got fixed but then the guest came back down saying their toilet was to low to the ground and complaining that the balcony door was hard to open. I did put in a WO for the door. However i'm not sure what Facilities could do about it. However this guest had been moved about 3 times right now. So she has expressed her unhappiness several times. I just advvisder her to speak to the Manager in the morning.",17,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CD111D30>
875,The mental defectives came out tonight. Send help. And liquor.,"What follows are two phone conversations, back to back, on the same night. My faith in humanity dwindles daily.

First, at 4:30AM, the phone rings. ""Thank you for calling the Adultery Sin and Sheets, my name is Archonet, how may I help you?""

*""What are your rates for this evening?""*

""Give me just one moment ma'am [...] Rate for the evening is $99.99 + tax, total estimated cost, $114.95.""

*""Will you take $45?""*

[my customer service voice falters as my brain short-circuits while trying to process the audacity] [""... Not... a chance.""](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/307/189/6fe.jpg)

*""Excuse me?""*

""I'm sorry, no, I can't give you that much of a discount.""

*""Do you take AAA?""*

""Yes, ma'am, we do, but that's only going to knock off about $10 or so.""

*""Do you aim to sell out tonight?""*

""We aim to sell out every night, ma'am.""

*""So let me get this straight. You have rooms available, you're not going to sell out, and you won't give me one for $45?""*

[**""Yes.""**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Mjf2pg4MFQ)

*""Do you have a manager I can speak to?""*

""Not at 4:30AM, no, ma'am.""

*""Fine then. Bye.""*

""Have a wonderful evening, ma'am."" *click*

... lady, I give you credit for chutzpah, but no -- I am not giving you over half off just because you think you deserve it. That's not how this works.

Then, not *thirty minutes later,* the phone rings again. ""Thank you for calling Subpar 9, my name is Archonet, how may I help you?""

**""How many rooms you got available?""**

""... How many do you *need*, sir?""

**""I asked first.""**

[oh you're gonna be a *peach* I can just tell] ""Alright, sir, allow me to check.""

While I'm checking and tallying up all the rooms (because fine, you want to know how many we have, I'm going to tell you exactly how many of each type and how many beds that totals to), he decides to be a bit more forthcoming.

**""I'm taking a bus of 35 people from [city about 2 hours away]""**

""Ah, I see.""

**""You guys do early check-in?""**

[the gears turn in my head as I realize what this chucklefuck is about to try]""... How early are you planning on arriving?""

***""Bout an hour from now.""***

""Well, sir, if you check in at 6AM, our normal check-in time is at 3PM; we'll have to charge you for the previous night into this morning, and then for today if you plan to stay past 11AM checkout. So, for two nights.""

**""Hell no you're not doing that. Does it change if we're coming from another time zone?""**

\>does it change if y-... [YOU WHAT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5sGUV-nEkQ)

""[... No, sir, the hotel goes by our local time zone, as it's the one we're physically located in.](https://i.imgur.com/eCT8vEx.jpg) You'd still need to pay for two nights if checking in at 6AM.""

**""Okay thanks.""** *click*

And it was only at this moment, after he had hung up, that I realized something. The city he said his bus was coming from, dear reader? The city two hours away?

#*It's in the same fucking time zone we are.*

876,The Perfect Ending to a Hellish Weekend /s,"What a nightmare of a weekend!  I'm on Night Audit this weekend (lately I have been working days over the weekend at the request of the Housekeeping Manager and Supervisor) and it has been pure hell.  I know none of this seems too horrible, but it was a constant ""chipping away at my last good nerve"" kind of weekend.  I'm sure a lot of you can relate!

Friday night - from midnight until 3:30 am, Breezy Bacon called us looking for rooms 30 times (yes, I counted).  Of those 30 calls, exactly 3 of the ""desperate for a room"" callers showed up.  Audit is usually run at 3 am, but because I was waiting for some of these yahoos (at BB's request) I didn't start it until 4:30 am.  I hate being behind schedule, especially when it is for absolutely no reason.

Saturday night - Not quite as many phone calls from BB, but one of the calls made me so mad, I wanted to cuss the little fucker out that called.  He wanted to know if we would accept cash for a caller he had on the line.  Sure, we take cash HOWEVER there is a $200 cash deposit required when we take cash.  This fuckwad says to me ""That's a bit excessive.""  He then goes on to explain that the caller only has $150 with him,  so we need to work with him.  Um, no - no, we do not need to work with him.  After tax our rate was $145.  He asked if I could just waive the incidental fee.  I told him that I could not and would not, because my GM would hold me personally responsible for any damages to the room and I am not about to stick my neck out for some random person.  The agent again told me that our incidental fee was ""excessive"" and we should really work with the guests.   I was sick of him and told him to bring the issue up with my GM on Monday, because there is nothing I can do.  Dude, you work in the call center - don't try to dictate policy to a property.

3:30 am     A lady comes in to check in - but she only has 2 prepaid cards, which we do not accept.  Doesn't have enough cash for the room plus deposit.  Says she will add her friend who does have a proper debit card.  Asks for 15 minutes to go get her friends card.  I told her she had to be back in 15 minutes or I would cancel her reservation because I had to get audit completed.  While waiting, another guest who is ""literally 5 minutes away"" wants me to hold off so she can check in.  

A flurry of phone calls hits, so I can't keep an eye on the time - 45 minutes later, I'm done with all of them.  I cancel the one reservation, charge the other one and start audit.   You all know where this is going, don't you?  Yeah, 5  minutes into running audit, they ALL show up.  I dropped the last shred of customer service I had left and told them they would have to wait until I was done with audit. 

When I was done, I got the lady checked in that had been charged and she was okay with it.  She swore she never told BB she was 5 minutes away and I believe her.   I told Miss 15 minutes that I cancelled her reservation and she got pissy and said ""I TOLD you I would be back and not to cancel.""  I told her, ""Yes, you said 15 minutes.  It was almost an hour.  I have things that HAVE to get done by a certain time.""   ""Oh, uh, we decided to stop off an get a bite to eat.   Didn't realize it was that long.""  I recreated her reservation and wouldn't you know it?  Card Declined.   ""Oh, I have to call my bank to get a lock taken off.""  So, in the HOUR AND A HALF you've had, you didn't think to do that already?   Ya'll, I wanted to throw both of them out on their asses and tell them to NEVER set foot on this property again.

Sunday night - Hmmm, what's with the gaping hole, caution tape, and orange caution cones just over the curb in the parking lot?  Too dark to tell at a glance.  Go inside and am informed that we have no water in the office, lobby, or in any of the rooms (2 separate buildings),  What happened, you ask?  Apparently, a couple were driving through the parking lot and the lady threw her cigarette out the car window.  Instead of it going out the window, it landed on the guys foot, which freaked him out and instead of hitting the brake, he hit the gas and plowed into the above ground water pipes ripping a hole in the water main and causing a minor geyser in the parking lot.  The water had to be shut off and the city *should* be out to fix it on Monday.

Guests were given the option of being walked to another property or staying - they were all informed that the water will be shut off until tomorrow.  Some left, but 98% stayed.   Of course, those 98% are wanting compensation for being here without water.  

The bright point for tonight is that I did get to start my audit on time!!!",22,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CD1116A0>
877,A question from one front desk agent to another,"**I in no way mean this in a racist way, just as a general question**

This JUST happened to me, and it brought up a few memories from awhile ago.

&#x200B;

*I had a couple walk up to me and say ""we want to take a picture with you, you are cute"" to me in broken English.*  


So, within my two years of working at the front desk, I've been asked by quite a few people if they could have a photo with me. Thing is, each and every one of them have been from some sort of Asian descent.

I have heard once or twice of people from Japan really liking blonde hair and blue eyes, but I'm unsure if this is a myth, or do I just get curious/ weird guests who want to take pictures with me?

I'm looking to see if this has happened to any other front desk agents, or if any of you have some answers lol.",82,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CD111580>
878,"""We just drove five hours to get here.""","If there is any one thing that has consistently baffled me in my 11 years in hospitality, it has to be people showing up 4, 5, 6, or even 15 hours before check in and becoming indignant when I tell them I don't have a room ready for them yet. Case in point: I get a phone call at a quarter to noon from a gentleman who has a reservation for tonight, he wants to see if an early check in is possible, ideally, in the next hour. I ask for his name, pull up his reservation and see that he has booked a suite with two double beds, a room type that we will only have one of tonight. 

Here, I should mention a few things. Our check in time is 4:00pm. Our check out time is noon. We were completely sold out last night. We had two large groups in house who were all due out today; one for a wedding and one for a family reunion. At the time I received the call about the early check in none of these rooms (including the sole double queen suite) had checked out yet. They were in it for the long haul. 

I inform the gentleman on the phone of all these circumstances and tell him that while I can still get him in earlier than 4:00, the earliest will probably be around 2. He says that's fine and he'll see me in a couple hours. All good, right?

I don't know what the fuck happened in this guy's brain between the time he hung up the phone and the time he showed up at the desk 45 minutes later, but here's how it went:

I'll be Me. The guy who apparently disregards any information relevant to his travel itinerary immediately after hearing it will be Guy.

Me: Hello. Welcome. How can I help you today?

Guy: Hi. I called about an early check in awhile ago, not sure who I talked to but the reservation is under _______. 

Me: (a bit confused) Uh, yeah, that was me you spoke with earlier but as I said on the phone we don't have any rooms yet and probably won't-

Guy: Yeah, but that was 45 minutes ago. I figured you'd have one ready by now. 

Me: (still a bit confused) Yes, sir, but as I said on the phone we only have one of the room type you reserved available for the night and that room was still occupied at the time you called-

Guy: Well, we left [City Name] at 7:00am and just got off the road. My kids have been stuck in the car for five and a half hours.

Me: I understand. But as I said on the phone my best estimate for when that room will be ready is 2:00pm. 

Guy: You don't have *any* rooms ready?

Me: The only rooms I have ready are King Standards and I don't-

Guy: That won't work, I've got my wife and three kids with me. Can you just call me when the room is ready?

Me: Of course, sir. 

Jesus Christ. 

I have to point out that the guy wasn't being too rude and I can understand that he's probably worn out from a five hour road trip with three kids but why the hell would you just show up an hour and a half earlier than *when you were told the room would be ready?* I don't understand why people think they can play it so fast and loose with check in times. If you had a reservation at a restaurant would you show up three hours early and expect to get seated? If you have a doctor appointment at 3:45 are you going to show up at 1:00 and act incredulous when the receptionist tells you to have a seat? If you get to the airport 5 hours early do you expect the fucking plane to take off? 

I just don't understand why this dude had to get on the road at 7:00 am when he knew how long the drive would take and obviously knew what time check in was.",159,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CD1113A0>
879,That time I read a review,"So I don’t work in the field, but I was recently looking for rooms at a certain destination near me for a quick getaway over my break. I saw a hotel/casino listed and since I’m not really into gambling, I just wanted to see pictures of rooms. I was scrolling through and most of the pictures are food, drinks, and the casino floor. I keep scrolling and suddenly a picture catches my eye: a hot tub… with someone in it. I’m like what the hell? Who would post that?? So obviously I click on it to read the review.

Apparently, this woman has stayed in this specific hotel/casino several times and makes it clear that she has always been one to let them know exactly how they can improve the guest experience. It goes on for PAGES. She then relates her most recent experience she’s had at the property and blames the non-functioning jets in the hot tub for the loss of: her wedding rings, her inheritance, her bed, and quite possibly her marriage. Oh and her son lost a bunch of money gambling there that same night so obviously the jets not working affected him as well as he didn’t even have a hot tub.

Idk how y’all deal with these people. I was so drawn in to this wild ride I ended up reading ALL of her other reviews of properties because why not. They’re all pretty unhinged, and she has reviewed a lot of casino/hotels. I feel bad that this woman can’t see the reality of her own addiction and the effect it has had on her life, and instead chooses to blame the hotel. That’s unfortunate, but it made for some entertaining reading, even if it didn’t help me make a determination on booking the hotel.",35,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CD111280>

If they are ready early we will of course let them into the condo, but before NOON? Are you kidding me? No notes in the reservation, nothing. Not that we would have approved it anyway since there were guests in there last night and housekeeping has to flip the room.

881,Global Warming,"Just had to share...

I live and work in Northern California at common chain Inn. We have been having some odd weather this past month. It was cold/rainy one day and 70's the next day.

882,"The Lion, The Witch, and This Prideful B*tch.","Work as night audit at a small family owned, and this woman was having a birthday party for herself with her husband and 3 kids ranging from about 10 to about 14.

I first noticed them because the wife and the husband were out in their car drinking.  Better, I thought, than drinking in the hotel, so I left them to it.  Locked the doors.  Put up a sign stating very clearly the doors must remain locked.  Tied the handles together with a ribbon for those too stupid or lazy to read the sign, so they’ll think twice before just opening the deadbolt without telling me.  The couple carried on drinking and smoking in their car for about an hour while I watched the camera out the corner of my eye and chipped away at my audit.

Risking a security walk at around 12:10, I go past her room and hear the three kids up in the room, stomping, laughing very loudly, and screaming along to Dora the Explorer.  How do I know it was Dora, you ask?

KIDS BEHIND DOOR: “Swiper no swiping!  *giggles* … SWIPER!  Nooooo swiping!!  *laughs* … … SWIPER!! NO SWIPING!!! *stomp, stomp, jump, fall, laugh*”

…now, they’ve got paying guests trying to sleep on either side of them, and they themselves are an already somewhat trashily behaving Suxpedia couple.  In fact, as I went outside earlier on to complete a security walk, I noticed that not only were they drinking on their car, they were downing wine out of our hotel glasses that they’d brought out there with them.

So.  I’m beginning to form a plan, when I notice the parents are coming back in.  I unlock the front doors, but the phone rings before I can head off the two suxpedidiots.  It is, naturally, the room next to them saying that there’s a commotion in the room next door.  I promise to look into it.

I try calling up to the room.  Of course, nobody answers.  I start getting a written warning prepped and printed.

5 minutes later I hear stomping from above me, go out to investigate, and the entire family comes out the elevator.  I inform her I’ve heard banging and ask if everything is okay.

LADY:  Well, I mean, look at how many people are coming out of this elevator, dear.  Of COURSE there’s going to be some noise.  *looks down at me, somehow, despite me shorter than me*

ME:  I understand that.  I heard enough banging to cause concern, I just wanted to make sure everything is okay.

LADY:  We’re fine.  It’s my BIRTHDAY.  Or it was.  It is.  *for a moment she glances around*

MAN (who looks completely exhausted):  We haven’t been to bed yet.  It’s the same day…as it was.

LADY:  MY birthday.  *she brushes past me, through the front door*. We’re just going for a smoke.

ME:  …uh-huh.

…so they go outside.  I watch on camera for a few minutes as her children tear around the parking lot, kicking rocks and chunks of ice.  Then I decide to make my move.  I go out to her, with the written warning.

ME:  Soo, I just got off the phone with one of the rooms next to yours…

LADY:  Uh oh!

MAN:  …we’re being too loud…

ME:  You’re being a little loud.  The guest complained about stomping and loud laughing and something about somebody screaming ‘Swiper no Swiping’?

CHILDREN: *burst into giggles*

LADY:  Oh, that would be this one.  It’s just Dora.

ME:  Yes, I know.

LADY:  Look, it’s my birthday, this is what I wanted, this is what I love: seeing my kids have fun.

ME:  Right.  And I love Swiper too, I get it.

LADY:  It’s just Dora!

ME:  …and it’s also nearly 1 in the morning.  So if we could just…bring this to an end.

LADY:  But this noise complaint—

ME:  — Is just a warning.  *looking at all of them* Please, it’s nearly one, can we just…just shut it down and go to bed.

…so I go back inside, optimistically thinking it’s over.  When she comes back in, though, she waits at the desk.  Her husband cowers behind her awkwardly.

ME:  Hel-lo.

LADY (with the creepiest smile):  Hello.  Listen.  I have very honest children.  And they weren’t even being that loud.

ME:  …I understand, and I will try to be in your corner, but—

LADY:  —I mean, I literally asked them how loud they were being, and they showed me.  They said ‘Swiper no swiping!  Swiper no swiping!’  See, I’m not even being that loud.

ME:  I understand, it was probably some old, persnickety couple that—

LADY:  They weren’t being loud.  The other people are lying.

ME:  …look, I’m just ticking a box here.

MAN:  Yeah, he’s just doing his job.

LADY:  OKAY.  *she looks back to me, hard* And in order to ‘tick your box’ properly, you also need to hear MY complaint.  So.  *she puts the written warning on the desk and slides it across to me*. This is my response. 

ME:  Fine.  I’ve been responded to.

LADY:  Great.

…she walks away.  They go back up to their room.  I continue my audit, fuming a bit.  She and her husband come back downstairs a half hour later, to go back outside.  

I think to myself, fuck it, I’m not opening the door for her after the way she spoke to me.  
And I’m not expected to either.  At my shitty little property, the way it works is that people leave through any other door but the front door (all of which lock behind them), and the front door (locked from the inside), is itself used as a control point.  Then, to re-enter, they have to go through the automatic main doors into a vestibule with a phone where I can screen them before admitting them through the locked front doors.  It’s a poor solution to the immediate issue of many many homeless on my side of town.

Anyway.  I choose not to get up and go above and beyond.  She encounters my note, reads it, attempts to open the deadbolt, it gets stuck.  She sighs dramatically at the door then, with her husband, goes out a side door and they go back to their van, presumably to drink and smoke more.

I go to the side door they just left to ensure they didn’t prop it (they didn’t), then decide to go do pool stuff, as they were out there an hour last time.

As I get back from doing the pool, I see her car door open, so being the nice guy I am, I open that locked front door, open it wide, and prop it with the foot.  She can’t see me from her car, but would easily be able to get in once she goes through the automatic doors.  I didn’t particularly want to interact with her again, so I go back into the office.

The show starts on the camera almost as soon as I get sat down.  She and husband exit their car, which is right next to the main entrance, and then begin walking AWAY from the main entrance. 
After a second or so I figure out what’s going on:  she can’t, in her mind, go through the main entrance because she would have to *speak to me* and *ask me for help* (oh the horror)!  …and so, she was looking for a different way in.  A way that does not exist because, remember, the front door is the only control point.

I watch the other doors to see if she can somehow get them open…but no, it gets better.  A minute or so later, the eldest child comes down in the elevator, taking rapidly and anxiously on her cell phone.
The lady is trying to get the kid to let them in.
I grab some Miss Vickie’s Salt and Vinegar chips and watch.  The kid goes all the way down to one entrance, at the end of the first floor hallway, looks out.  Wrong door.  Flaps hands anxiously.  Paces in front of the vending machine.  Goes back to the same door.  Talks into phone quickly.  Starts breathing faster and waking faster.  Walks all the way to the other end of the first floor hallway.  Looks out. Wrong door.  Paces up and down that hallway another 3 times, speaking very very stressfully and anxiously into the phone.  Tries a third door.  No luck.
Finally, after about 2-3 minutes solid of this, kid is smart enough to try going to the front entrance.  Sees the door is wide open.  Walks through the wide open door and starts yelling on her phone, making very righteous slashing movements with her hands.  Turns on her heel and goes back into the elevator.

I am, at this point, killing myself laughing.

A minute or two later Lady and the Man come through the front door, quickly.  She’s a good car length ahead of him, speed-walking with intent to murder.  She casted a hateful glare at both the front door and the front desk as she passed them, then stomped into the elevator.  Husband didn’t make it and got the next elevator.

Curiously, her room was dead silent after that point.

EDIT:  Don't worry, I was up there every 10-15 minutes throughout making sure the room wasn't being unreasonably noisy. And after the parents went back in, it wasn't. And as soon as the parents went back out again, I popped back up, hoping to record some audio of the kids screaming like idiots. They weren't.

The next step would have been to boot them all out, which is exactly what the written warning I handed her says in nice plain, scary font.  In the end, I didn't have to go there, though, both because the kids did actually quiet down, and because the Karen gave me an opportunity to fuck with her. And then she took it.",41,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CD111130>
883,Corrupt/dumb receptionist?,"Ok so Have wanted to relate this old happening but had to wait til my Karma and time on reddit was enough to let me.  Im 45 now medically disabled but at the time was working when this happend.  I was 36 at the time.  Hell the things I have seen in my time I could fill reddit with but most would be too mad to be believed lol  


So as a union rep for my workplace union I have several roles, Bracnhffical, health and safety and training coordination (helping ppl get training in our oitside of work).  The Union once per year held a conferance for the reps in each speiclisation so I would get to go to all 3 most of the time.  This time the conferacne was a celebration of what we had achived as a union for our members in helping them get new/better grades and qualifications as well as working out how to continue as the UK govt was cutting the funding for the Union edcuation funds.  


Had the usal dramas (trip was from the North East of the country to Cardiff in winter) got there ok but the venue instead of the usual travelodge/welcome break hotels was infact a 3\* hotel in cardiff - means nothing to me im working class and proud of it.  


I go into the underground secure parking lot with a pre issued swipe card (the Union ahd already paid the hotel for everything barring drinks/roomservice.  Go to check in only for the desk clerk to tell me she was not letting me sign in for my room until I provided either  my credit card/debit card or £350 in case deposit to cover parking charges, wifi in my room etc.  


I told her to check my reservation and she would see that I was in a room prepaid for including the deposit by the Union - she refused to even check and said I either paid for it or Security would kick me out and take the keycard for the car park - not letting me retrieve my car.  


At this point stressed out, tired after a 4 and a half hour drive I pulled my phone and called one of the organisers for the conferance and told her what the problem was..  She came charging out of the confeance hall where they were setting up and they ended up having a full on screaming match in the reception.  


In the end I got my room keycard without having to leave my debitcard or cash with them as it was aleady paid for. Later on at dinner the organiser told me she had been called to the front desk 6 times over the same issue with the same person.  When she called and spoke to the hotel manager - that recpetionist was kicked offsite and fired - she apprently was onher last day of notice after being fired and was trying to screw some money away maybe?  Far as I know big hotels like that dont ask for a cash security deposit and this was a mass booking for 200 delegates at £300 a night plus the security and parking all done as a job lot.  


I was glad when we went back to using Travel lodge never a problem there  


TLDR I think a receptionist on last day was being wilfully bad at her job or trying to rip me off",8,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CD1111C0>
884,Middle-aged man is apparently not old enough to drive in California,"*(names made up, blah blah)*

This just happened and this is such a night-shift thing that I simply couldn't not share it.

So it's 2:30 AM and I'm just enjoying the tail end of my dinner in the back office of the Kusoplan Inn when I hear the doorbell ring, indicating that someone's at the front door. Insert RPG random encounter woosh and fight music here.

I look out the window, see a middle-aged man (the fact that he's middle-aged will be important), unlock the door, and let him in.

He says he has a reservation for tonight. Hoping that this is one of our two remaining arrivals, I ask to see his ID and a valid cred or deb card for the $50 security deposit. Instead of pulling out a driver's license or passport or whatever, he removes his lanyard and presents what seems to be some sort of non-government organization's laborer card, which we do not accept. I tell him we can't accept that as identification, it has to be a government-issued photo ID and he says he's not old enough for that.

I clarify that I mean something like a driver's license, a passport, or an ID card, but he reiterates that he's not old enough to drive. Except, this guy looks and sounds like he's middle aged, got facial hair (whatever I can see that isn't covered by his neck gaiter for a face covering) and everything, so unless he was hit with some sort of rapid-aging illness, he should be more than old enough to legally drive here? Hell, I even got my first ID card from the DMV when I was 10 years old.

Getting back on topic, he gives his name, Joe Flyshark, and I don't see a Flyshark anywhere in our arrivals list of two reservations. I explain this and he insists the res was already paid for in cash. Now, while there isn't any explicit policy against advance-payment bookings (other than prepaid bookings with virtual cards provided by Eggpedia, Pricewine, HotdogTonight, and other third-party booking sites), it is exceedingly rare that guests or people booking on behalf of them pay us directly in advance for the room, much less in cash. And I know for sure that we don't have any advance-paid bookings because the reg cards for our remaining two arrivals both show balances, and even in the (more likely than I'd like it to be, which is never) event that he booked for the next evening (21st) rather than the current evening (20th), I just printed the next evening's arrivals about an hour ago and I did not see any advance-paid bookings or bookings under Flyshark in there.

I ask Joe if he got a confirmation email so I can see what happened with his booking, and he says he doesn't have an email account because he can't afford them. Uh? Free email accounts have existed for literal decades, whether through Yahoo, Gmail, Hotmail, etc.

I'm beginning to suspect he's just trying to troll me at shit o'clock but he seems too straight-faced to possibly be joking. I don't think he's drunk, high, or on any other mind-altering substances either, he seems composed enough (unless he's built up a tolerance). I don't have enough variations of the *thonk* emoji for this.

Finally, he concludes this encounter by telling me that there's a noise complaint from some room; he just makes a hand gesture that seems to be ""5-1"", but I know that none of the rooms here have ""51"" anywhere in their numbers. I just shrug and he leaves and goes back on the street.

Anyways, thank you for calling the Kusoplan Inn, no we don't rent to fire sharks. How may I help you today?",16,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CD111D00>
885,Liar thinks I'm lying so naturally begins to lie some more,"We are very busy this weekend and when I get on at 3pm there are no singles available just doubles. After assigning rooms I have around 20 left to sell and they're selling steadily throughout my shift so I close inventory around 7pm. By 9pm I had a handful left all on the upper level. A little after 9pm in walks Flaming Liar Pants.

FLP: I need a room what are your specials tonight?

Me: We do not have any specials tonight I'm sorry ~~we're not a restaurant~~ but I do have double bed rooms on the 2nd floor for $65.

FLP: What about your singles?

Me: I am all out of singles for tonight what I have left are the doubles. 

FLP: Uh huh ... so you don't have singles at all.

Me: That is correct Ma'am.

FLP: Uh huh ... *starts tapping her finger on the counter staring at me for several awkward moments*

Me: If there anything else I can help you with Ma'am?

FLP: Ok I called earlier to make a reservation for a single and was cut off.

Me: What time did you call Ma'am?

FLP: About an hour ago they said they'd hold the room but I was cut off before I could get a confirmation. I gave them all my info.

Me: And you called this property?

FLP: Yes.

Me: I was here during that time and I don't remember getting such a call.

FLP: *tap tap tap tap tap tap*

Me: I'm sorry for the confusion may I have the number you called so I can clear this up.

FLP: I deleted it, I delete all my recents.

I betrayed my customer service training and made a puzzled face after which FLP said ""I'll be back"" and left the lobby. She stood outside for several minutes talking on the phone.

FLP: Ok I talked to someone they said you have a single bed room available and its $45.

Me: I'm sorry who did you talk to?

FLP: Overpriced Line.

Me: Did you speak with them about today's date?

FLP: Yes.

Me: That would not be possible as I closed down out online booking system hours ago due to limited availability. What I have left tonight to sell are the double bed rooms at $65 would you like one of those rooms.

FLP: Can I get that for $45?

Me: No.

FLP: *tap tap tap tap tap* OK Bye.",41,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CD111220>
886,Elevators are hard,"Yesterday I get a guest checking in, and I go through the entire spiel and give him a room. His room was 8XX, and I send him on his way. Twenty minutes later he returns and says the elevator will only go to the 7th floor and he was unhappy.  I decided to make new keys for him, but I need him to at least state his name. He says his last name, and then when I ask for his first name he just says unhappy. I proceeded to tell him I do not have any guest registered by the name unhappy. He then relents and gives his full name, I remake the keys, and then I go to the elevator. He never pushed the button for the 8th floor. The reason the elevator went to the 7th floor was because somebody on the 7th floor called for the elevator.

He asks me about the rooms, what types, what’s in them, etc and i go over it. I ask him for the check in date to give him a starting point for the rate. He says he wants to hold the room for now. Ok, fine. 

Me: so checking in on x date, and what would the check out date be?

Him: oh i don’t know. I just want to hold a room. 

Me: ok, we will just need a check out date, it can always be modified later. 

Him: just hold it for now

Me: we just need a date for check out in order to create a reservation. Would a week be a good start?

Him: yeah that’s fine. 

I make the reservation, take his info. Because he said it was for someone else, i ask for the name of that person. 

Him: just put it under mine. 

Me: are you checking in, or is someone else?

Me: not right now, it can be added later. 

Him: do you need to know who’s staying in the room?

888,The Descent of a guest I once cared about,"I would like to preface this with an apology for posting basically only negative stories. I feel like a guest review... if it's bad, the complaints come, if it's good, why talk? I guess it just makes me feel better about things. Anyway, on with it.

So this guest first started staying with us pre-Covid. An older man, probably 70s or 80s, and charming in that grandfatherly sort of way. Always willing to story-swap. 

He stayed probably 8-10 nights, spread over a few visits, then Covid hit he understandably stopped coming by for a while, and when he did come back, he was... different. He was a rewards member and suddenly was demanding of special treatment (later than usual check-outs, earlier than usual check-ins, which usually aren't a problem, but also are never guaranteed, no matter who you are).

And then real problems started showing up, like payment issues. And he'd be demanding about special treatment there as well. For instance, he was about $40 short of being able to pay a night once so we just adjusted the rate down. Membership benefits plus still being in relatively good standing at that point. But then it became a regular thing... he'd always come up with it eventually but still a red flag.

Finally, it hit the fan yesterday. We were sold out and he expected us to extend him. We told him we could not and he blew up on everyone who tried to talk to him, saying it was unacceptable, how he spends 'so much money here', swearing up and down. We ended up having to call the cops to have him removed and DNR him.

Breaks my heart, knowing how he once was and how he is now. After losing mom to Alzheimers I swore I'd never wish dementia on anyone, but I honestly hope that's the explanation and not that he was secretly always horrible.

Wherever you are now LM, I hope you get whatever help it is you need to go back to being everybody's grandpa, but you can't come back here anymore.",16,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147C93528B0>
889,“Good help”,"A guest came up to the desk last night to check in.

Me: “Hello, may I have the last name under the reservation?”

Guest: “-common last name-“

Me: “Perfect, welcome to Large Chain Hotel Mr. Common. Are you a member of our loyalty program?”

G: “Yes it’s all there on your system.”

M: “It doesn’t look like it was added when the booking was made. I can always add it for you. Let me verify the details of your stay. You’re here for just one night, checking out tomorrow?”

G: “One night?”

M: “Yes, it says here that you’re staying until tomorrow, Saturday?”

G: “Saturday? I’m here until Sunday. What are you talking about?”

M: “No worries, would you like me to change your reservation to check out for Sunday?” (SOP is to always ask guest for confirmation before changing reservations)

Guest proceeds to laugh and shake their head mockingly.

G: “Man, I know it’s hard to find good help nowadays but this is… the fact that we’re even having this conversation right now is unbelievable.”

I keep my cool.

M: “Would you like me to update your reservation to check out on Sunday?”

The guest then completely ignores all my following questions and mockingly sings along to the lobby music.

I ended up extending his reservation anyway and continued the check in just like any other, complete with bubbly personality. He didn’t say another word to me and wouldn’t even look me in the eye.

Wow, I know it’s hard to find grown adults with emotional maturity and basic manners but this is unbelievable /s",26,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147C9352FD0>
890,Someone has just checked out for the last time.,"A long-term guest has just passed while in the care of the 2nd home hotel, he had underlying health issues and it was known his time was short. During his last week he had friends and family visit that he had estranged himself from, we held him a dinner banquet with them (Which we don't do) and made sure all their needs were met. It is unfortunate that he has passed, and I grieve with his family who flew from all around the country who came to spend his last nights with him.

On another note, It's my last night at this hotel, where the GM and I share a mutual hatred for each other, but can't get rid of one or the other. And I just had to call them to inform them of the death of our beloved long-stay at 4am on their weekend.

EMS rolled in like a firetruck, demanding to know where the stairs on, informing them that they're locked and the elevator is faster anyway, one guy's already on it and motions for the other. Well that was three, Three more - same questions, and one smart dude already at the elevator. (The Stairwell is locked by key access and is on the exterior of the building, it takes longer for me to make them a key than for them to call the elevator because our computers are 10 years old) I made them a key, all the same.

Another bout of people, this time they just confirm the room number, turns out the first batch got the numbers mixed up, and had to take the elevator down. Hilarious, but serious in an emergency.

\*Inhale\* \*Exhale\*

Rest in Piece, honored guest. You let me take one last jab at my awful GM.But for real, may that dude find peace, and his family some comfort.

Obligatory ""BUT WHY ON MY SHIFT"" insert.

Edit:Thank you all for your kind words and appreciation, it means a lot. I'm doing O.K. I just need a breather, death and I don't mix, and it triggers a lot of PTSD for me, which is why the NSFW tag.Again, thank you all for your kind words, and I hope you all have a lovely day.

891,Tale of the crazy man who thinks he works for the company and doesn't.,"So we have a guest in house who it turns out is trying to assist other people who happen to be a bit on the down and out. There have been a few issues with some of the people he has brought in. I'm going to share these emails to tell the tale for me. 

The first one is from one of his people who made a reservation. The second is a detailed experience that I sent to my GM.

&#x200B;

 ""This is the owner Covid 19 given a Exclusive order if a demand CRAZY MAN here iam located in the hotel already at my brothers room but I'll be checking in mines about 8 a deluxe plaza suite I want the room next to my brothers room 504. Make sure that's available for me Now this is how this will play out I'll come to the front desk saying iam Locked out of my brother room Devon in 504 and whomever working at the front desk issue me a key with the room number written on the back of the key ... No questions need to be asked if so that's your Job remember iam digital so if you want to keep your job follow this simple instructions you can text me as well \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*  letting me know to come down and obtain my room key which ever employee complete this task without me having problems will be issued a Raise and Christmas bonus Check of $700 Now let's make sure this is taken care correctly thanks your owner Mr CRAZY ASS DUDE.""

For starters, this person isn't the owner. Nor does he work for the company as he claims. 

Now for the email to my GM. 

 

on 11.18.21.

A few minutes before my shift, A guy comes out the back door and begins to smoke. He begins claiming that first he works here, that he is the son of the hotel owner and then that he works for the ""parent"" company. He then said he has a reservation for the night. I told him not to use the back door as it is only an employee's. He again said ""I work here"" I ended up cancelling his reservation. 

He came to check in and used 6 different declined cards then wanted me to call Todd to get him checked in for free because he ""works"" for the company and isn't supposed to pay and that someone else is paying for the room. I said no. and ended up cancelling his reservation. 

A bit later on Co-worker's  lunch break. He went out the back again after being told not to and after we brought the cardboard inside that we use to prop the door open. She again told him he couldn't be back there. 

Around 9. pm I heard the back door near the back office open and I went to investigate. I walked to the outer staff only door and noticed it was propped open again with a large flat green scrubber sponge. 

Went outside and warned the guy again not to use the back door. He then asked for a cab to go somewhere to get money to rebook for another room. I obliged by calling him a cab. 

It has not escalated to a point where we need to kick out the guest. However, to my knowledge there are currently a minimum of 4 people inside the room though I do believe I saw 5. None of which are the guest himself. 

A few minutes after the last incident with the door. Houseman came to the desk and informed us that this same guy that I had called a cab was laying on the green couch on the 2nd floor. Javier and Devorn went up to the floor. He yelled at Devorn and Javier to go ahead and call 911. I went up and got him to come sit in the lobby while he waited instead of calling 911.. 

Ultimately, he was waiting for me to come find him to tell him that his taxi had arrived. 

9:45 his cab finally arrived and he left. 

He never came back at all thankfully. And if he ever does. 911 is getting called. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

What was left out was the fact that right after I sent the email, I discovered that this guy had been hanging around our closed 2nd floor for over 8 hours.",15,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CC9EF730>

893,Sometimes Suxpedia Doesn't Suck...,"This just happened to me, and in hindsight I realize my mistakes, so please don't come at me for them.

I was checking in a guest who had booked (and prepaid) through Suxpedia. The check-in process went fine and normal... until I went to process the card. I accidentally posted the payment to the second folio. In my internal panic, I messed up and clicked ""correct""... refunding the virtual card. I finished the check-in, and got the expected ""card declined"" message. I knew it would. I did the full check-in spiel and sent the guest on his way. 

Knowing I made the mistake and not wanting to leave it for my auditor, I called Suxpedia to get them to issue a new virtual card. Finally got through to someone, and the Suxpedia agent was an angel!!! He went through the details of my explanation as to what happened, and initially sounded like he wasn't going to issue a new virtual card because he couldn't see the refund/correction (something about 7-11 business days). I begged and pleaded, and after a brief hold, he got me a new virtual card number! This sweet man made my night, not to mention saved my ass!

Now, here's the thing, I'm not a technician. I can't fix the TV. Even if I could, I was busy. I told him I'd put a note in for the handy man. He called me a r****d and stormed off.

Now, even if it weren't just a very vile name, I have a lot of self image issues, revolving around my mental acuity. I mean I'm a college dropout working in hospitality despite scoring fairly high on my SATs. My life choices aren't exactly intelligent.

So, yeah, that day ended with me bawling in the front seat of my car. My supervisor told me not to worry about it, mentioning how pathetic that guy was, bringing his mommy with him to a construction job.

Just a short story about how vile guests can be in so few words.

I just want you all to know that you have worth. You are a better person than every scum sucker who harasses you.

And if you're a guest, or worse QA, just remember that we have to put up with this on a daily basis. We don't owe you a smile.",16,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CC9EF820>
899,The Lying Witch and the Warm Room,"Oh, the joys of of working Night Audit.

12:30 on a Sunday night. Lady checks in and an hour or so later calls and says the room is too hot.

After rattling off how to change the heater, she says she did it and it didn't work. So, I say ""Ok. You want a room transfer?"" Because she's on the top floor, heat rises, makes sense. She says ""no, the kids are already asleep.""

Now, this is the first sus thing. If the kids are somehow all asleep, then why is she having so much trouble? I was a kid once, and could never sleep at my grandma's house because it was too hot.

Lady says she'll open a window, but doesn't want to keep it open because ""it stinks and people are yelling outside"". I reply ""How is it smelly? And people are yelling outside? I can go tell them to be quiet.""

She says nevermind, she'll open a window and hangs up again. Nobody outside, and no weird smells, especially 35 feet in the air.

She calls back again and again intermittently through the night. I keep offering the room transfer, and even offer her the front desk fan. She keeps saying no to every solution I offer (especially the fan, which, on a personal note, I sleep in an unairconditioned basement and fans work wonders). She keeps fishing for me to comp her night. I pretend not to notice her obvious hints.

Then, 7am, just as I'm packing up to leave, she and her husband come down and yell at me for not even coming up to the room, going on and on about how this was the worst night they ever had and that they NEVER wrote a bad review before. Mind you, every phone call involved a ""look, I know it's not your fault"".

I tell them to their face ""and do what, exactly? We're not a full service hotel, and I'm not a handy man.""

They stormed off after that. Their kids looked confused as Hell.

They did this in front of the breakfast girl and our permanent resident.

I relayed the story to the AGM, and she's like ""whatever, probably fishing for a comp they aren't getting.""

They call back later that day and spin this sob story about how I was so mean to them and didn't even offer a room transfer. I didn't just offer them a room transfer, I offered them two rooms (out of DQs, so offered two Qs) every single time they called. All this was plainly documented on our security cameras which have sound and backed up by a coworker and another guest.

The part about this that makes me so angry is they lied about me. You can take issue with the hotel, but when you target someone who has tried to help you, it's about the most vile thing you can do.

If they wanted to get a cheap room, there were motels just one exit down. No, they purposefully booked a $102 a night room (which is dirt cheap for a double queen) and tried to make up complaints that I couldn't fix. 

If you want a free room, stay home. And if you genuinely have issues with your room, you're not getting jack squat if you yell at people.",34,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CC9EF370>
900,My coworker takes random walks during rush hour,"I usually work opening shifts at the desk so mostly checkouts is what I deal with. But I always ensure to have everything ready for the PM shift so they have a smooth check in routine no matter if it’s a slow day or a busy day.  I also have a another co worker who works mid shifts with me on weekends and he  is usually  the one who deals with partial checkouts as well as check ins. He always tells me about the PM guy who would leave him by himself when it’s our check in time and usually super busy. 

I never encountered this until one day I was scheduled for a mid shift and had to stay until an hour after our check in time. The PM guy comes in at 3, goes in the back and spends around 10-15 minutes reading the notes from the previous day and then proceeds to spend 15 minutes in the bathroom. My usually co worker and I are manning the desk and dealing with guests while this guy comes back and informs us “so I’m gonna take a walk”.

Mind you this was 30 minutes into his shift and he still hasn’t started working, I had to run and catch my bus because we were constantly dealing with guests and this guy decided to waste more time doing pointless tasks. Management is aware but their constant warnings don’t work because he’s  worked here for a few years and thinks he’s going to get away with everything. Some days he doesn’t even show up in uniform and randomly stares at the desk from a corner in the room (wtf?). I’m not sure how to do bring this up to management again so they can take some serious action because I feel it’s unfair for us to do our best and this guy gets away with slacking! Also I’ve started leaving some finishing up some duties like taking the trash out so he can deal with it lol but he never does",46,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CDEC55E0>
901,Refund over a lamp," I was working the afternoon shift when a guest called down because one of the standing lamps in the room wasn't turning on. I asked if he checked to see it was plugged in, his response was that he wasn't going to check and that I needed to get him a new lamp because he paid for a working lamp and that he wanted a refund if the 'problem' wasn't fixed, it was a company paid reservation. I went up to the room, without a new lamp, he asked me where the new lamp was, I said if I may and went into the room, plugged in the lamp, and turned it on. I said have a good day, anything else dial 0 and the front desk can help you, and left. He tried to later complain saying I didn't fix the problem, my manger said"" the lamp is working right?"" he said yes, my manger said ""then the problem was fixed."" he got upset cursed out my manager, then hung up.",35,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CDB8C7F0>
902,Retreat Booking Drama... Among Quilters,"So I've been working at this high-end Bed and Breakfast for about nine years. I've seen a lot go down in that time, but nothing like this. For context, the area I'm in only has tourism based around one thing: Amish people. Naturally, that also includes their hand-made goods, like quilts. The original owner of the place I work (who I also worked for and is a sweetheart), is an avid quilter, and hosted a small quilting class with a few ladies in the lobby (with full permission from the current owner). These ladies then decided to book a retreat with a group of quilting friends. We have 11 rooms in total, and they planned to occupy the main building, taking seven rooms.

This seemed like a great plan. We had met them, had reference from our previous owner, secured the minimum group down payment, outlined our cancellation policies (particularly since it was a busy time of year for us and Veterans Day weekend), and we had it set in stone. Then came the first cancellation from the group leader, who we'll call Deb (all names obviously fake). Seven rooms became five because of unexpected surgeries, and these were done before the cancellation fees would have hit, so this was fine (although my boss was not happy).

Then we start getting phone calls from the other ladies, two in particular who we'll call Harriet and Sophia. Harriet was concerned about not being able to use our kitchen, which we told Deb they could absolutely do, within reason and food safety guidelines. Sophia had been under the impression there were two beds in every room, particularly the Standard rooms, which is not the case and even a cursory glance at our website would have said as much. They demanded we have extra beds for them in the rooms (so one person could sleep in the Queen bed and another in the extra bed) and we DO typically have roll-a-way beds, they were just in need of updating/replacing. So my boss spent $600 each on new, twin-sized roll-a-way beds for these rooms so the ladies could have separate beds.

Our cancellation policies state (especially since 2020) that emergency cancellations for illness will not be charged the full fee of one-night's stay. Sophia called less than a week before the Retreat to say she couldn't come because Harriet's husband was ill. Curious, I asked her what that would have to do with her being able to come. She said Harriet was the only person she had met in real life prior to the retreat, so if Harriet couldn't come, she didn't want to go alone. So I asked, ""Are you cancelling because of an illness related reason, or just because you don't want to come?"" and she became upset. She said ""I have until two days prior to my arrival to cancel.""

Aha. She dropped the veneer of Harriet's husband being ill (he wasn't) and admitted she just didn't want to go. I informed her the cancellation period was two weeks, not two days, and that was laid out in our policies. She became irate, blaming Deb for not informing her and saying that since she didn't know, she shouldn't be held to the policy. I told her that isn't how it works. She hung up after I told her she wouldn't be charged if we re-sold the room.

Then I received a call from Harriet, telling me that if she was going to be charged anyway, she'd like to book a room for one night, instead of the three nights the Retreat was supposed to take place. So not only was her husband NOT SICK, she wanted to come stay DURING THE RETREAT WITH HIM, without being a part of it or talking to any of the women who were.

So, five rooms turned into three rooms a part of the retreat. We spent hundreds of dollars on new roll-a-ways (which needed replaced anyway), of the five women who were actually meant to be in those three rooms, only three showed up, leaving Deb to carry the vast majority of the $1500+ bill, Harriet DID show up with her husband and checking her in WHILE THE LADIES WERE LITERALLY QUILTING IN THE LOBBY was an absolute awkward nightmare, and I spent several hours over the course of a week on the phone listening to middle aged and elderly women talk shit about each other behind each other's backs... over Quilting.

In the end, the ladies who came had a lot of fun. They loved their rooms, loved that we made space for them, brought a lot of food, and enjoyed our christmas decor. The entire time, though, I was thinking about Deb and Harriet throwing shade at each other, not knowing they were staying two doors apart.",28,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CDB8C100>
903,Guest Tried to Convert Me Despite Already Being Christian,"So this just happened a few minutes ago. I work for a fairly well known chain that has friends and family discounts you have to send a form for. I got one from a guest from what looked like a ministry email so I asked her about it to make conversation. We discussed religion a bit before she went on. 

Later on she came down talking about this church camp she was going to and started asking questions about my beliefs culminating in asking if I believed in Yeshua. When I told her I was a Methodist she seemed a bit shocked and then said “don’t be offended or anything but I could have sworn you were Jewish.” 

Oddly enough this is not the first time someone has mistaken me for being Jewish. It doesn’t happen often but it has on occasion but this was the first time anyone tried to convert me. Bizarre situation all around.

Edit: I was informed that Jesus’s Hebrew name pronounced Yeshua is actually a misconception so I took out the part explaining it as if it were historical fact. I left the name spelled as is because that’s how the guest pronounced it.",67,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CDB8C4F0>
904,Whiplash of a Check In,"I had the most insane check in yesterday, and I swear I got whiplash from it. Basically, the dude walked up to the desk, and all I got to tell him was ""Good evening sir, how may I assist you?"" He looked at me absolutely flabbergasted, as if I had spoken an alien language. He immediately turned around and walked back to the valet section. Now it was my turn to be stunned. Being the anxiety ridden little fucker I am, I ran through the interaction in my head a good 3 times, trying to analyze if I *did* actually say something weird. Nope. All checks out.  


Mr. Apparent-Diamond-Elite-Globalist-Businessman came back with my manager in tow, chewing his poor head off. Spouting nonsense about my *terrible, god awful* customer service, How he was awaiting the return of our hotel, and that we were the reason he lost his Diamond-Elite-Globalist-Unobtainium membership, and how  dare I not recognize him from before the closing.  This is where I would like to note that the hotel has been closed for the last 4 years, and I myself am new to the country lol.   


After verbally cannibalizing my poor manager, Mr. Entitled sauntered over to my desk once more, and began glowering at me. In that moment my manager and I had a psychic connection, and I could feel him saying to me: ""*I am so fucking sorry this guys is a god damn lunatic. Please for the love of god all but suck his dick during this check in. Make him stop.""*    


So naturally, I gave him my best dick sucking membership welcome I possibly could, and thanked him for his loyalty, and gave him a complimentary upgrade to one of our best suites. (Unfortunately this is all I had available so I had to :(((( ) He was unsatisfied even by *this* and turned to my manager to say ""*Can you fucking believe this? THIS is what I'm talking about! I don't mean to be rude, but what am I supposed to say to that??""*  Ignoring this, I gave him his keys, did the normal spiel, and bid him a good night. As he walked away he shouted at me, ""*YOU NEVER WELCOMED ME TO THE HOTEL!!! I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU TO OPEN FOR YEARS. I CANNOT BELIEVE HOW DISAPPOINTED I AM.""*  


That's it. That's what I did wrong. Instead of saying ""WECOME TO \_\_\_ HOTEL!"" first, I ruined his check in experience, and all expectations he had for our opening. Ironically enough, on check out he said he loved all the staff, which upon hearing that, gave me *more* whiplash.   


TL;DR I said ""Good evening sir, how may I assist you?"" instead of ""Welcome to \_\_ hotel!"" first, thus ruining his entire experience, and crushed his excitement for our 4 year reopening.",43,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CC9E2E50>
905,Just found out my colleague is actually my supervisor…?,"I (25F) started a week before B (25M) and we helped open a brand new hotel. He barely did anything the entire time. The housekeepers and I were in the rooms on all fours, scrubbing into oblivion, making beds, inspecting rooms, etc., while he did tasks that didn’t matter, like random vacuuming in the hall (???). I am the best desk agent in the building. I was voted the very first staff of the month because I cross trained in every department so that we could effectively open the hotel. All of the people I trained with, including him, still ask me for help on simple tasks like issuing a refund to a guest. When our front desk supervisor fell ill during this time and resigned, I asked for the position, and the GM said it was filled, but we have never had a supervisor, and I didn’t think anything of it.

I recently found out B makes way more than me and is listed as “front desk supervisor” on paper, and on his LinkedIn account. No one has said anything about this— not the GM, not the AGM. They have literally been keeping all of this a secret for a year. B even left for three months and came back and he’s still listed as the supervisor, even though I handle all of the front desk’s needs. 

I think this has everything to do with his gender and race and nothing to do with his capabilities. I didn’t say anything or fight them about it— I just went and found another job. I now have a job lined up with a downtown 5 star hotel, which I was hired almost immediately, and they’re offering me way more than my job could even dream of. When I submitted my two weeks notice, the GM immediately offered to match whatever they’re paying because they “need me”. Which was another slap in the face, because they had the means to pay me what I deserve, they just didn’t.",142,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CC9E2DC0>
906,Not sure if I should be happy about this,"So there’s been an update to a comment I posted 2 weeks ago in a Free For All thread. 

To recap, I felt like I was getting cheated out of an extra dollar or two of pay on night audit because I have to handle most of the problems that front desk supervisors handle. And the day supervisors have housekeeping and maintenance during their shift. I’m left to fend for myself so if some maintenace issue occurs I have to find a temporary fix for it until maintenance comes in the next day.

Now for the update. My FOM pulled me aside before my shift to tell me that he talked to our GM and both are on board for promoting me to a night supervisor, which this property has never had. Since my property hasn’t ever had a night supervisor they need to get it approved by corporate before they can move forward. But I really didn’t want a promotion I just wanted a bump and pay. I know I’m being choosy and beggars and be choosers but I can’t seem to find any joy in the situation. I know I probably won’t be doing anything different from what I do now but I just don’t know how to feel about it. I’ve been a shift lead before but it wasn’t at a hotel and it wasn’t a very good experience so it kinda put me off ever wanting to be a supervisor ever again.",34,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CC9E2F40>
907,It drives me crazy when guests do this and it happened twice today ...,"One of the things about this job that drives me nuts is when a guest asks for a discount AFTER the transaction is completed. Why wait to ask until after they sign their rental agreement, listen to all the rules I have to say, hand me payment and complete to transaction to request a discount? I don't understand it.

I was trained not to preemptively offer a discount even if I know the guest qualifies because we're cheap like that. The first one was an elderly lady who waited until I handed her her keys and thanked her for her business to ask me if we have a senior discount. *INTERNAL SCREAM* Yes Ma'am we do I need you to fill out this ~~annoying and lengthy~~ refund form ~~which could have been avoided if you asked for discounts at the beginning like normal people~~ while I process your refund.

The 2nd one happened just as I got off the phone with Hellpedia because the guests sister booked the wrong room type and she insisted she booked the correct room type and I was being an inept ass because I didn't know what I was doing. The sister refused to listen to me explain that I cannot alter a prepaid OTA hell-reservation in anyway including changing room type as that alters the cost etc. etc. Finally after about an hour and a half of dealing with Hellpedia and Hell-sister did we sort that all out.

A young guy came in and rented a room nothing spectacular happened and he went on his way. About 15 minutes later he walked back in for something and noticed a sigh that read ""Active Duty Members Get A Discount Please Ask At Check-In"" and asked for the discount. I was deflated after the Hellpedia call and processed it gladly that even though annoying at least it wasn't as bad as a Hellpedia call lol. 

The worst one that happened to me was after I finished renting a room to a person and she asked me if she could get it cheaper on-line. I said possibly and if so she'd need to book through them to get that rate as we don't honor on-line rates. She said OK and whipped out her phone and stood in the lobby as I watched in horror realizing she was booking a room for a cheaper rate after I literally just checked her in. I'm ashamed to say I caved refunded her reservation and checked her into her new one lol.",27,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CC9E2EB0>
908,Bazaar shift and complaints,"So yesterday I walk in to start my shift at 11pm.(I’m the night auditor) I start rolling the night around 1:30am, and I’m just talking to are security person when this guy comes in. He asked to talk to the security person saying he is getting chased by the cartel and wants me to call the police. I said ok called the boys in blue got there in record time talking to him and they take him to the police station. Who ever was chasing him was caught with in 2 hours. The same guy that asked me to call the police comes back to thank me and told me the story. Apparently when they arrested the people that were chasing him the van they were in had a bunch of rifles and drugs in the car. The guy who came in was on a bicycle and the “cartel” was in a car and was not able to keep up with him lol. 

So this morning around 5am people were coming down as I’m setting up the coffee station, people come up to me and wanted to talk to a manager🙄. I ask why and they were saying a guy from the front desk last night was very rude.(side note the guy was talking about the pm shift person and has only been working with us about a month at this point and work at an other hotel and got I want to say about 10ish complaints about him and also got a talking to about his attitude to guest 2 time if I remember right) they told me when he was checking them in he had a tone with them. I say like a good little drone that my manager isn’t here yet but they will be in around 9 or 10 this morning but I can do is give them my managers card to call when they come in. They say thank you and leave. From 5-7am I got about 10-12 complaints. WTF did I walk into the twilight zone when I clocked in. 

Ps when this guy came to come work for us the drawer has been coming up short ever since he started working here. 

TL;DR some guy came in saying he is getting chased by the cartel police catches the people that was chasing him and complaints about one of my coworker attitude.",29,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CC9E2F10>
909,Guest freaks out that I don't know what happened when I wasn't there,"So this just happened about twenty minutes ago. I'm the supervisor on the desk at a pretty small operation. We have a pool and waterslide area, but not too many staff. I'm working the AM shift this morning. 

So, for background, my shift last night had a guest having a medical emergency in the pool area. She called an ambulance, and wrote up the incident report accordingly. This morning I read the report and it mentioned that a guest was pretty pissed at her for 'how she handled' the situation. I didn't really know what that meant, but figured I would hear from the guest at check out time. For context, both our GM and our OM are not on the property for a couple of weeks, so it's my show until then. 

Fun stuff. 

Anyways, this guest, who I'll call G, comes up to check out and asks to speak to a manager. I inform her that it's me until next week. 

G: The way that last night was handled was unacceptable. I think that employee needs to be f-ing fired! (She's already worked up.)

Me: Oh, I did read the incident report about it. May I ask what happened that you thought should have been done differently? 

At this point I'm just trying to get information, because I obviously was not there. Apparently this is a cardinal sin. 

G: She didn't call 911!

Me: Oh? In my incident report it says that she did, but you're saying that that didn't happen? 

At this point G goes batshit. She starts off explaining what happened, which was exactly what I was trying to get her to do. Apparently me simply listening and not lighting my own torch and digging our pitchfork out of the desk drawer set her off. Midway through her story she starts yelling at ME, as if I had been there to do something. 

G (condescendingly): Do you know what a stroke is? I don't know if YOU'VE seen the commercial but - 

At this point, I'll admit,  I interrupted her. I have a degree in Psychology and was considering med school before I took this career path, so safe to say, I know what a stroke is. It is doubtful, however, that she would know what cerebral ischemia is, if I had told her. 

Me: Ma'am I am aware of the seriousness of that condition. So you're saying- 

This is when she lost her god damned mind. She started screaming at me about how I'm disgusting for defending that 'little b-tch' and I should be fired as well. She takes off down the hall, where I can still hear her yelling about it for quite a while. 

I'm perplexed at this point, because I was genuinely just trying to get some more information. I have plenty to do though, so I figure she'll be back down at some point with her luggage and keep on taking checkouts and going through tonight's arrivals. 

A little later, her and her daughter come down through the lobby pushing the luggage cart. I nod at both of them and say hello, and they look at me like they wished I was dead. The daughter says something snide about 'you guys' being disgusting. She then came back inside and started actually screaming at me. Didn't let me get a word in edgewise. Now apparently I had handled the situation wrong, despite not being present. She screamed profanities for a bit, insisted we were all getting fired, and left. 

I am not good with being screamed at. I was shaking by the time this was over. I am just so frustrated because I was genuinely just trying to get their account of what happened. Now apparently I am worse than dirt and should be cast out on the street. I want to make it clear, I am in no way trying to undermine how serious that situation was. I just don't understand how I am supposed to solve anything without clarifying some key points. I'm not just going to fire an employee because someone felt that they should have reacted slightly faster. It's a stressful situation, and not everyone knows what to do immediately. I understand being upset or disturbed, but screaming at a 20 year old in the morning is not going to solve any problems.",106,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CC9E2D60>
910,"You already laid out the tracks, now you just gotta back it up","TLDR provided at the bottom. It's a long one, but worth it to read through to the end.

You know whenever you go to a party and tell people you work in hotels and they ask you what's the wildest shit you've ever seen? Yeah, this is my story. Background: massive hotel was bought out for an Indian wedding. If you've ever had an Indian wedding at your property you know exactly what those are like.

To set the scene, it was 4:15pm and everything was going swell, no complaints, no issues, no incidents and I was set to go home on time 15 minutes later. Fate had other plans for me. I get a call from our DOSM, the guy directly dealing with the wedding families, and tells me to go to bride's family suite as there appears to be some kind of medical emergency. I think everybody hates those calls, the initial minutes of not knowing what is happening and what you will face til you get to the scene. I asked DOSM whether he had any details and he said someone mentioned heart problems, and just asked for medical assistance from a manager.  I grab my blazer, throw it on and rush out the back office through the lobby knowing there will be one of the security guards there and on my way I tell him to radio control to let them know I'm going up to suite so and so and to send the hotel nurse, an EMT bag and security supervisor. He asked if I wanted to wait for them first but I said no I'm going up first to see what's happening.

On my way up a thousand scenarios flash through my mind of what I'm going to find there. Most likely nothing serious. But what if it is? Will I need to do CPR? When the fuck did I last attend a CPR course? Am I still certified? Whatever, I'll take it as it comes. I get up to the floor, round the corner to where the suites are and I see two men standing in front of the door with their hands covering their mouths and with an expression of shock. Holy shit what is going on in that room. I start running and within seconds I finally get to the door, introduce myself and ask them what has happened. One of the guys turns to me and says ""The zipper appears to have been caught in the skin"".

The whole world around me stands still, not a sound and not a movement. The first thing that comes to mind is that scene from There's Something About Mary. And my next thought is someone is messing with me. Our DOSM was a notorious prankster, surely he's standing here somewhere having a giggle after roping in the bride's family on his little shenanigan. I look around, but alas I am standing there with those two men in the corridor who are still pale as a ghost. So I go into the room, the biggest suite the hotel had, a long winding corridor through the dining room, living room and finally the bedroom and then the bathroom. Covered in blood. And the bride's brother rolling in agony on the floor clutching his crotch. His parents stood in the bedroom trying to calm him down and told him the nice front desk manager is here now to help. It took me a minute to digest this scene and really come to grips that someone has actually gotten their peep caught in their zipper so bad that blood sprayed everywhere. A few short moments later the nurse appears, a lovely 65 year old lady who has seen it all and her first words were ""holy shit.""

I tell her to tend to him the best she can, pop out into the bedroom and tell mom and dad I'm calling an ambulance right now. I rush over to the working desk, punch in the emergency number and the call center manager picks up immediately and I tell him I need an ambulance immediately. The son start screaming in pain, so I cut him off and say just get me that ambulance. You see, news travels fast in this hotel, especially when you have security call it in, so they were aware something was going on, and everybody downstairs still assume it was heart problems, so they made the call with those details.

Now remember how I mentioned this was an Indian wedding? For those who don't know, the more wealthy you are, the more distant relatives, neighbors, friends and family you invite. This family was very wealthy, and while this is all happening, they were all congregating in the lobby where the function room is. And also the main hotel entrance. Where the ambulance would pull up. 

Mom pulls me aside and says this would be a huge loss of face for them to have the bride's brother wheeled out on a stretcher in front of all of their guests because he got his wiener caught in his zipper. She asked me to find an alternative way to have him taken out of the building. Alright fair enough, so I yell for security to come in and I tell him to radio the guards at the front of the hotel to direct the ambulance to the loading bay in the back. Done.

While this radio conversation was taking place, my boss and the GM were standing in the lobby overseeing with the head of security, who hears the ambulance instructions and tells them. It was our policy to send the ambulance to the loading bay in case of death, so they all had assumed that someone died, and causing a massive exodus from our management to descend upon this room. They were running a few meters behind the paramedic team that was being led up to the room. And as I pop outside into the corridor to direct them through, the doctor (yes we get a doctor when we call an ambulance where I am) shouts to ask what's the situation and I yell back that the patient got his penis caught in his zipper. The medical team is unfazed, and everybody leaps into action grabbing supplies and I show them into the room. But our management also heard this exchange. And when I come back out they're all trying their best to contain their laughter and expressions. Alright guys, party's over, piss off all of you and let me do my job here.

We successfully extracted the patient through various back corridors and service elevators, and he was taken to a great hospital where he received 17 stitches on his manhood. His mother came to thank me the next day for not only handling the situation well, but also protecting their family pride and making sure everything was done as discretely as possible. Oh and the dude also checked out with me a few days later, definitely one of the more awkward encounters I've ever had. The story still gets told to new employees and is known as the Zipper Incident at the property.

TLDR: guy gets his dick caught in his zipper because he's rushing to get ready for his sister's wedding, I stealth extract him through the backdoor without any of the guests noticing with the paramedics",52,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CC9E2A90>
911,"""I understand you have this privacy policy, but..."" 🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩","*(usual disclaimer, made up names blah blah)*

Another day, another douchecanoe who does not give a shit about the protocols hotels implement to protect their guests.

So I'm just sitting around on night audit duty when in comes this non-guest visitor, who we'll call Jane Tiheli. She parks her car in the driveway, normally I'd tell her she can't do that because that's blocking the driveway, but she insists that she'll only stay for five minutes while she goes off to see her husband. I assumed that Jane knew which room her husband was in and that he had told her he was staying here, so I didn't really question her statement, but I did inform her that after 5 minutes I will ask her to move her car out of the driveway, even setting a watch timer to enforce this.

Well a little under five minutes later and Jane has come back asking me for the exact room number of her husband, James Twicobra, since it seems she can't find him. She's asking if James is in Room 102 or 103, which I know is way off because he's in Room 122, but obviously I don't disclose that and I just tell her that I'm not going to give out room numbers or otherwise officially confirm this guest's presence. And nothing in James's reservation or in notes from my day-shift colleagues mention anything about getting contact or providing keys to others.

Jane gets in her shitty car and leaves and I assume that's the end of it.

That is, until 30 minutes later when she comes back and asks me to please pass on some documents to James. I tell her I won't do that; for me to relay anything would confirm that the guest is here. Even without a room number, just revealing that a guest is here could cause problems, let alone danger, for that guest because now they can't safely step out of their room. Yeah, maybe James and Jane are genuinely in a healthy marriage and I'm intruding on that, but it's better I stand by the hotel policies even if it upsets them relatively mildly than honor her request and later find out that James was in an unsafe situation and trying to avoid her.

""I understand you have this policy but--"" And yet you are treating our privacy and safety policies like they're things you wipe your ass with.

""I stay in other hotels and I never have this problem!!"" Okay *shut the fuck up*, we are not other hotels, and those other hotels aren't following hotel standards if they're able to just middle-person communications from unauthorized outside parties to guests, or give out room numbers.

Eventually she threatens to come back in the morning and tell on my manager before storming off. *Yeah, you do that. My manager is also acquainted with the whole notion of guest privacy in a goddamned hotel.* Try staying in a hotel as a registered guest sometime, maybe then you'll feel thankful for the privacy and safety protocols they follow.

At any rate my manager relieved me in the morning and by the end of their shift, they did not make any mention in the communication log of some whiny old fool insisting on the whereabouts of Mr. Twicobra and telling said manager that Rin Marina is a horrible bitch who breaks up couples and listens to rain sounds for hours in the lobby, so I assume that Jane was just barking empty threats at me.

Anyways, thank you for calling the Kusoplan Inn. I'm a night auditor, not an information broker. Anything else I can help you with today?",53,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CD80F1F0>
912,"Entitled, thirsty babies","I’ve had it up to here with these shiny jewel status members thinking they are entitled to unlimited free bottled water during their stay.

913,"Play stupid games, Win stupid prizes","Just as backstory I went to school with all 3 of these people. None of this surprises me 

I took an extra shift to get Thanksgiving off. Well I checked in a local lady into what was supposed to be a standard king room only for her to request a 2 queen. I explained the difference in charges she agreed. We exchanged pleasantries, reminisced on how I was considered the quiet mean kid of my friend group. Completely pleasant and an enjoyable exchange. Until the man came in she seemed very annoyed and gave him a key and left to go to the room. Well they left some time around 8 p.m. to get dinner, go to the bar, ect. 

Well they returned around 9/ 10 p.m. he was complaining about the two beds and why she wouldn't sleep with him in the same bed. She said ""I'd rather put my \*\*\*\*\* lips in a toaster"". I about fell over crying. Later she came down a left a key for her ""friend"". Her ""friend"" arrived and I gave her the key. After about 45 minutes the ""friend"" came down and looked like she had been crying, the man was completely naked except for the towel he wrapped around himself. He asked for a key to get back in the room. I had to inform him that he wasn't a registered guest so I couldn't give him a key. He is now waiting in the lobby bathroom because I let him use the lobby phone to call his mom so he could get clothes and leave.",26,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CD80F5B0>
914,A Tale and a Question,"Hey fellow Front Deskers!  Hope you've all been well since we last chatted.

This happened over the weekend and I'm truly conflicted about what to do, so I would appreciate any and all thoughts and suggestions.

A co-worker checked in 2 gentleman, who paid cash and the $200 cash deposit.  The form they sign for the deposit CLEARLY states that deposits cannot be returned until AFTER 9 A.M. when housekeeping can check the room. They spent about 15 minutes in the room before coming back to the front desk demanding a refund (no clue as to why - the FDA either didn't ask or they didn't say), which she handed over, including the deposit.

The room showed up on the next mornings paperwork as VACANT/DIRTY so the housekeeper who was running the floor, was going to go into it to strip it for cleaning.  There was a lady in the room who stated she would be checking out shortly.   Cue the FDA's favorite game - FIND THE GUEST.   No paperwork for that room exists.  She comes down to the lobby to check out.  She gives me a key packet with the room number on it - the same room the two guys had received a refund for.

I ask her if the reservation was in her name.  She claims it was and that she was the only person in the room.  Her name does not appear in our system.  She then says she started out in another room and was moved, but couldn't remember the original room number when asked.

She leaves because there is nothing more that I can do - she simply was never registered.  I tried to convince myself that she was a secondary party in someone else's room.

Housekeeping is on my ass about what happened because their papers say VACANT but someone is in the room.  Hey, I'm as confused as you guys are, don't jump on me about it.

I question the swing shift and the 3-11 clerks, they know nothing of this person.

Next morning, I ask the Audit Shift guy if he knows what happened and this is the story he tells me.

Our mystery lady came in and he was having trouble getting her card to go through for the $145 rate.  She finally confessed to him that she didn't have enough money in the account to cover the room.  She had driven here from Georgia (we are in Arizona) and she was soooooo tired, she started to cry, so, he just gave her the keys to the room the previous FDA had refunded.

Tomorrow is the first time since this happened that I will see any of the management staff and I don't know if I should tell them what happened or just wait until someone asks if we ever found out what happened.

What would you all do?

&#x200B;

EDIT:  First of all, thank you to each and every one of you that confirmed what I already suspected - I needed to tell management.  The day after I wrote this, I was on Night Audit and when a member of management came in, I was going to tell her, but she already knew and so did the GM who had already had a talk with the NA that did it and the FDA that refunded a cash deposit (room unchecked).  Thankfully, no one in question damaged anything - we are just out the cost of the room and tax.  I don't know how they are going to settle that one.",22,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CD80F190>
915,People think this town parties a lot harder than it does.,"Hello again. I'm still a fairly rookie night auditor at Wyatt. It's a nice property, recently built, conveniently located next to a conference center. The center is one of our biggest sources of business, but also headaches...

I arrive at 10:55. There's a group in the lobby and a bartender desperately trying to go home. (He's the lucky one here not having to deal with this.)

The night goes on. 1:30AM. We need the lobby empty to clean, and these guys are not having it. My coworker asks them to leave, so they move to the other side of the lobby. He does some beautifully passive-aggressive table wiping before asking them more firmly to leave so he can mop without getting sued when one of them falls. They exit, attempting to break out the locked rear exit and promptly getting called on it again. I start running audit just to have a better reason to not sell them anything.

3AM. What do you know, our favorite assholes are back to hang out. They try to buy beer from the cooler. I tell them we can't sell alcohol after 2(which is true), and they whine at me and try to negotiate. I'm sorry, I don't feel like breaking laws for you douches. 

And then. The phone rings. I steel myself for another Mr. Patel, trying to tune out the drunk business bros in my left ear.

It's my coworker. He accidentally locked himself out. Fuck. I don't have a way to lock down most of the front desk area, but I close the laptops, lock the cash drawer, and sprint off to rescue Mumbly Mike. 

I return to the drunk assholes... who now have beers that they definitely did not have before. I am pissed. 

""I see you took beers. Even after I specifically told you I can't sell you alcohol. If you don't provide a form of payment AND leave my lobby, I'm calling the police for theft."" 

That at least got me a room number from the one who seemed the closest to sensible, who rounded the rest towards the elevator.

Jesus. My city has a reputation as a party college, which it is, sort of. It just ends at 2AM. And not on a goddamn Monday.",41,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CD80F7C0>
916,Thought we were being pranked but they really did leave something behind,"This happened a few years ago. I've been away from the property for awhile so I finally feel I can share it. I am on mobile just in case.

I came in one day for the evening shift and there was a peculiar note in our communication book. Two guests (a lady and her mother I believe) said when they checked out ""We can't find our snake in the room but we have to go!"" I asked my colleague that dealt with it and she said it was really strange, they said that and just walked out the door. Management went and tore the room apart but couldn't find anything. They wrote it off as a prank and cleaned the room.

About a week later, I was on the morning shift and when I arrived NA pulled me into the office. A couple checked into that room. The husband came to him at the desk right after and said ""Um there's a snake in our room, can someone come take it out?"" Somehow it didn't even phase these people! NA said told him ""I'm so sorry, I can't do that, we are sold out so I'm going to book you room elsewhere and we will cover it."" I was floored. Not only did a nightmare happen but they weren't even a little upset. I asked and yup, the snake was still in the room.

NA had messaged the GM about it. GM arrived about 20 minutes after me (early for him) and went with our new guy in maintenance to catch the poor thing. They brought it to our lost and found room, only management has access to this room. Maintenance had brought in a tank from home he luckily had.

This snake was BIG. Head about the size of a fist, and if I remember right about 5 feet long. Beautiful gold and brown colouring. Staff had nicknamed the snake Stella. I was so angry someone would leave their pet behind. I did look at the laws where I live and there wasn't anything we could do.

Stella stayed with us for about 2 weeks while GM made arrangements with the owner. I luckily answered the phone when the owner called the day we shipped Stella out.

Owner: Hi this is Owner. I don't know if you're aware of something that's supposed to be sent out soon?

Me: I think I know what you're referring to. That was sent out this afternoon.

Owner: Hahaha it's a really weird situation right? :)

Me: *flat* Yes.

Owner: Bye

I REALLY wanted to ask what was wrong with her. Luckily no one was hurt that week. My colleague and I figure Stella hid in the wall where the PTAC is.",46,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CD80F730>
917,"A pair of exceedingly dumb criminals, vigilante justice that somehow did not go terribly wrong and Rosie the Attack Muppet","So let me tell you, today was a whole ass day. We haven't had too many troublemaker customers lately since the boss raised the rates and started requiring a deposit for all guests. But today's big story did not involve a customer at all.

At about quarter to 4, the boss went to head home. He got out to his truck to discover that it was unlocked and had been gone through. He came back to the desk to check our extensive cameras to see who the fuck had gotten into his truck. We were able to spot the two guys who got into the truck. They were dressed distinctly enough that much to our surprise, we could also see them returning to the property, and they were about to walk right past the lobby.

My boss has no chill to speak of, and bolted out the lobby after them. These two chuckle fucks shit their collective pants at the sudden attack and split. Boss picked a guy, I did not ask him what criteria he used to decide which, and gave chase. As he ran out the lobby, in his haste he did not realize his goldendoodle Rosie was on his heels, excited about this fun new chasing people game. On her heels, was the head housekeeper. I on the other hand ran into the back to grab the [Just In Case Pipe](https://imgur.com/a/AEG2998), because I'm fat and slow and knew I wasn't going to be able to catch up if they were running. But if there was a fight, well, I was going to be prepared.

I ran outside, following the sound of the shouting and saw my boss and the HHK, as well as Rosie running around while they tried to catch her. I managed to snag her harness, and my boss took the JICP and traded me his jacket for it. Then we spotted the idiot my boss had just been chasing looking through a gap in the shrubbery separating our parking lot from the next. Why was he looking? Because he's an idiot is the only reason I can come up with. My boss ran after him again while the HHK took Rosie inside and I called the police.

They took their sweet fucking time even though I was very clear that my boss was going to beat this kid's ass if he caught him. I left out the part where I supplied my boss with the weapon that was going to be used should this occur. A few minutes later my boss returned unharmed, but disappointed that he'd failed to catch the little fuck. He had a prize though, a cell phone dropped by one guy and a crowbar dropped by the other. He asked if we saw either of them on the cameras, we did not, and he set off to search the lot for them with the JICP in one hand and his newly acquired crowbar in the other.

Meanwhile ~~at the Legion of Doom~~ the police officer who was responding called my phone and asked for an update. I told her what my boss was up to and she was like yeah, he needs to not be doing that. She told me that they were extremely busy and shorthanded, so it was just her and one other officer responding. She was quite pleased to hear we had security footage though, and asked us to get that ready for them.

Once she finally arrived she took my boss's statement and seemed quite amused about how blunt and very from New Jersey he was about the whole situation. She also insisted she did not hear him when he said he pointed to the JICP and said he intended to beat the dude up with it. Also she talked him out of texting the dude's mom on the phone WHICH WAS UNLOCKED. WHO LEAVES THEIR PHONE UNLOCKED?! He went through the dude's text messages and the guy literally texted a friend that they were breaking into a car, and it had a safe they wanted to get in to so they were going to the store across the road to get a crowbar to try again. Them coming back for attempt two was what had been thwarted.

As we were showing her what all we had on camera, I discovered what might be my favorite video we've ever captured on our security cameras. It's even funnier than the lady wearing nothing but a sheet riding on the hood of a car. And that was pretty funny. I present, [Rosie the Attack Muppet chasing a terrified would-be car thief into a shrub.](https://redd.it/qv18xc) I cannot stop watching this video of that goofy ass dog chasing off a guy with a fucking crowbar. [Look at her](https://imgur.com/a/X7g6h4v). She belongs on Sesame Street. It also made the cop's day, and even though she had important cop shit to do, she went to her cruiser and got a treat for Rosie for being such a god damn good girl.

The boss hung around for a little while longer as the three of us let our adrenaline levels drop a bit and we laughed about what a crazy day we had. Little did we know... it was not over.

Boss finally goes to leave and I see him on camera talking to a girl I did not recognize in the vicinity of where Rosie chased the guy. I watched as they parted ways and my boss got in his truck and the girl started to walk away, then ran through the parking lot. I called my boss and asked what was that about. THOSE DUMB MOTHERFUCKERS SENT THIS GIRL TO GO LOOK FOR THE PHONE. I told my boss I saw her on the camera go to the fast food joint next door. In hindsight, perhaps I should not have. He decides he's going to go follow her, and hangs up.

I turn to the HHK and ask, should I call the police again? She agrees that I should. So I call them up and was like hey, so I called earlier and there was this whole thing. Well now my boss is doing this thing and I'm concerned he's going to do something really stupid. They connected me with the officer from before and basically what I told her is I'm concerned he'd going to do something he's going to regret in the moment, and well, you met him. You saw his enthusiasm for taking things into his own hands. She apologized, and said there really wasn't anything they could do at the moment because they were spread so thin but they were responding to a high priority call. She understood why I was calling, and said it was the right thing, but we had to hope he'd be an adult.

So that was cool and good.

We were busy af today so between all this madness, I was checking people in. About fifteen minutes later my boss calls me sounding like a kid who is about to be sent to detention. HE THINKS HE FOUND ONE OF THE GUYS AND CHASED HIM DOWN IN HIS CAR AND PINNED HIM DOWN. At that point in time he did not specify whether or not he meant pinned down with his car. He said they were trying to figure out if it was the same guy or not, and if it wasn't he was in big fucking trouble. He said the cops might be by to check the footage. With that, he hung up.

So there I am left at the desk wondering what the hell this hothead has gotten himself into. His wife is out of town, so was I going to have to come get Rosie? Was I going to have to bail him out of jail?

Fortunately, as stated, we were busy af which helped me take my mind off of the whole thing.

Imagine my relief when eventually I saw his truck pull back into the lot and he came to explain what all happened after he left. So he followed the girl over to the fast food place, realized it would look sketchy af for him to follow her, and decided to head home. As he pulled onto the street that runs behind the restaurant and the hotel he spotted a young man in a girl's hoody and track pants that clearly did not fit him. Basically, he looked like he'd swapped clothes in a hurry. Boss thought hm, that looks suspicious. What's he going to do if I flip a loud u-turn?

The answer was run like hell. My boss responded like any animal with prey drive would and tore after him taking his truck up over the curb. Once he caught up, he jumped out of the truck and chased the dude down with Rosie once again joining him because he forgot to shut the door. The kid tripped and fell and my boss managed to get on top of him and put him into a chokehold. A driver from the pizza place in the strip mall they were next to came up asking what the fuck was up and my boss told him to call the police.

Well, the cops get there and my boss starts to realize how bad this looks with vigilante justice and all. Especially considering the trial for the murder of Ahmaud Arbery and all being in the news. Especially when they ask if they're sure it's the guy from before and he realized, no, he's not positive. Supervisors and stuff get called out and my boss starts getting worried. He's familiar with the cops because of the number of times we've had to deal with them over the years and they're pretty blunt with him that he fucked up and went too far. Around that time was when he called me.

Eventually the cop who we'd dealt with first showed up and confirmed that this kid (who turned out to be 15) was in fact the same guy. She immediately recognized him from the cameras. They called his parents who told them to fuck off and hung up on them. So there's little question of why this kid ended up like this. I don't know what all exactly he'll be charged with. It was around this time that my boss told me that when he went back to his truck the second time he realized the fuse box had been messed with so they were probably trying to actually steal it not just get into the safe. The kid also tried to claim my boss beat him up, but the police were able to corroborate my boss's story with the various witnesses who were like no, he didn't beat him up. He did chase him with a truck though, and my boss got to convince the cops that if his intention had been to hit him with the truck, then that's what would have happened. They were also amused by the guy being scared of Rosie chasing after him and all.

So yeah, that's one way to start the week.

Edit: I discovered today that a little footage of the final chase was captured by our security cameras. Enjoy.

918,Can we get free breakfast with our $25/night reservation?,"So I’m not a hotel employee, but I just remembered this funny story.

Many years ago we had a death in the family and needed to quickly find a place to stay in Manhattan NY for the funeral. Through a family connection we were able to get a couple of rooms at a nice big name hotel for a ridiculously low price (like $25/night in Manhattan- unheard of!). The normal rate was probably $400/night. We go to check in and instead of being appreciative of the incredibly low rate and last minute booking my mother asks if breakfast is included for free.

919,Your generation doesn't know respect,"Hey all hope you're all having good night. This happened a couple of years ago but it actually ruined my week when it occurred. 

So I was working a slow 2nd shift one night in the middle of February. I was at the desk and I saw our phone ring and it had a guests room number on it. The guest on the other end must have hit a button on his room phone or something, because I didn't even have time to answer it. Thinking that if it was super important, the guest would call back. I see my maintenance guy having a smoke not 10 feet from the desk outside. I started to chat with him and my pager starts to ring (we had it in place of a bell). It took me two seconds to come fr outside and to get to the desk. As soon as I get behind the counter this is how the conversation starts.

Angry Guest: it's about time you got here!

Me: sorry about that sir what is it that I can do for you?

AG: well I called earlier and and no one answered. I'm in *room number.*

Me: oh yeah I saw you called then we got disconnected.

AG: No you didn't answer the phone like you're supposed to.

At this point I'm thinking oh great another on of these guys

Me: well sir what is it I can do for you tonight?

AG: well your housekeeping staff didn't clean my room today like they were supposed to *stops talking*

Me: well sir let me loo-

AG: hold on hold on I wasn't finished. I need bath mats and towels from you now.

Me: alright well let's go down the hall and-

AG: stop interrupting me and let me talk. 

The guest vents for like 4 minutes about...shit I can't even remember. Something about laziness or something lol.

Me: alright sir first let me look at our HK logs and see why you didn't get service.

Turns out (you can probably guess what the HK boards said) he had a DND on his room.

Me: well sir it looks like you had your DND sign on your door this morning and w-

AG: nope nope that's a lie. Your maids just didn't want to work. And listen I don't want to listen to your little fanatics (yes he used that word) just get my things I need.

Me: ok stay right here and I will be back with your things.

I go to the storage closet down the hall to get his things and he doesn't listen and follows close behind me.this always makes me uncomfortable and it's a little disrespectful TBH. He then follows me into the closet and waits in the doorway to get his things. I grab them and this is the conversation that follows.

Me: here you are sir. Everything you requested.

AG: *looks displeased* you forgot my tissue box I asked for! 

This guy's never asked for that but.whatever. I grab a tissue box and hand it to him. I even open it for him and start it for him

Me: here you are sir. Is there anything else I can do for you

AG: uh I'm waiting for an apology front you.

Before I can even answer he yells at me.

AG: you know you and your generation know nothing o
About respect. Nothing!

Maybe it was the fact he had been on my case for fifteen fucking minutes now as well as the fact he was cornering me in a closed space. But this is how I responded.

Me: *yelling* sir leave my generation out of this and get out!!!!!! Now!!!

AG: *nervous laugh then backs away,* no I'm not 

As he backs away from me lol. Then he acts all tough and rides the elevator.

NEXT MORNING

So I come in 8 hours later for first shift. I was the FOM at this property and was the one who had to do flips like that. I just knew this old man was around here somewhere waiting to pounce on me. Ruin my day or cause a scene. Actually I was so paranoid that another older man that look almost liked him I kept staring at. I realized after a couple minutes it wasn't him though. I felt really bad about that hahaha and went to chat with him about his stay so it wasn't as awkward.

But then AG comes back and shows up at the desk when I'm not looking. He glares at me and he surprises me with this.

AG: I need an envelope please. 

I give it to him and he puts $20 in there.

AG: what is the name of.your wonderful breakfast lady? 

Me: Stacy 

AG: we'll make sure she gets this money. Because SHE provided excellent service. Excellent!

Keep in mind, I had nothing against this breakfast person. But I knew AG was fucking with me because Stacy never did anything special. She microwaves eggs and mops. And I didn't hear her talk to any guests this morning so wouldn't you thank her personally? But regardless I say ok and put it in the cash box.

AG: now make sure SHE gets that bill. Got it no one else get it. Got it? *Eyes me up like. A theif* 

Me: yes I understand sir.

Glares then leaves. I think it's still funny he probably thinks it's awful he never got an apology.",68,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CD80F220>
920,"""What? No.""","I work in a downtown metropolitan city where the restrictions are still pretty high. Consequently, we've only just reopened our restaurant, and we haven't opened our dinner service yet, just breakfast. Need more staff and more permits before dinner can start. This means a lot of guests upstairs order food delivered to the lobby (Can't send randos upstairs).

As I was handing somebody their luggage out of storage, I noticed him pick up his meal from a driver and on the way by, I asked ""Do you need any utensils before you go upstairs?"" time and time again, there's no forks or spoons or knives with the order, so I order them to have at the front desk and I like to ask if I can, so people don't need to make two trips to eat. 

This man looks at me like *how dare you speak to me peasant?!* and looks me up and down, before saying ""What? No. If I need anything, I'll ask."" And hurries into the elevator. Whatever, no skin off my nose, I don't care if he needs utensils or not, but there wasn't a need to be that rude.

*Cue not even 5 minutes later, yep, you guessed it.*

He walks to the front desk, head hung in shame. I relish the moment, as he has to say ""The restaurant forgot the utensils... Do you have any?""

In a moment of sheer bliss, I had the audacity to say ""I'm so sorry darling, what did you say?""

Anyway I gave him his fork and he went away but still. Lovely moment, when I show a guest they aren't better than me just for patronizing my workplace.",22,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CD80F340>
921,I just LOVE when it all works out!,"Sometimes, you have a terrible experience with a guest and have to deal with them for an entire week. Other times, however, everything works out in your favor.

It's a pretty slow evening for me tonight. I'm the only 3-11 at the property today, but with less than 30 arrivals scheduled, that's not an issue. I am simply vibing, as I always do, before a duo approach me. I will call them Mr. Shiny and Mrs. Shiny, because I know in my heart of hearts that is how they wish to be addressed.

Mr. Shiny: Checking in for Mr. Shiny. This is our first stay as Super Special Shinies, so we're not sure what all that entails, but we're excited.

Me: Wow! Congratulations! \[This is genuine, because at this point, these people are being cordial and not ridiculous\] Well, I'll get you checked in and then we'll go over all the fun stuff. I see you booked our Full Suite with a view of the lake, and that's our best room. So I won't be able to get you an upgrade, but there's plenty of other great perks to being a Super Special Shiny.

I proceed to check them in, and then the question of parking comes up. We have valet parking, but it is controlled by the same folks that do our Bell services. I tell them that the current Bellmen we have are helping guests run luggage, but they will be back down very soon if they want to wait for valet and luggage assistance.

Mrs. Shiny: Hmm, well we can just do self parking for now and take up the luggage ourselves. We have a dinner to get to.

Again, these people are being pretty decent and cordial, so I have no bad feelings about them. Mrs. Shiny goes to start unloading the car, and I finish with Mr. Shiny. Now, because he is such a Super Special Shiny, there are a few extra things he needs to know. Since he's staying for 4 nights, this is all kind of important, so I am going through the list as quickly as I can. This, however, does not seem to be fast enough for our special guest. Eventually, he just snaps at me.

Mr. Shiny: LOOK. My wife is unloading the car. I'm leaving now.

I am a bit stunned by this, but it isn't the first time it's ever happened. We do have a lot of stuff to cover at our property, so some people get a little impatient with our spiels. I wish him a good evening and go back to my business. As this is happening, my bellman manages to return to the front drive, and asks Mrs. Shiny if she would like help with her luggage.

She completely ignores him, marching right pass him with roller suitcase in tow. This isn't uncommon either, so he brushes it off, but as Mr. Shiny passes him after leaving the car in our front drive, the bellman asks if he can hang onto the vehicle's keys. We have a very small front drive, and we do this in case there is an emergency where the guest vehicle needs to be moved to make space.

Mr. Shiny: \[while shooting a glare over his shoulder\] NO. I don't want ANYONE touching my car.

There isn't much we can do with an answer like that, but we're not super busy at this time, so the bellman figures it'll be okay. Of course, it takes 20 minutes for the couple to return, but go figure. What neither of us expected, though, was the fury they had for the room they booked.

Mrs. Shiny: I am NOT happy with that room! I am looking RIGHT AT another building!

Me: \[extremely confused, as I know this is a lake view room and I have never had anyone complain about the view before\] I'm so sorry. You can't see the lake from your room?

Mrs. Shiny: NO! I have to LEAN WAY OVER \[she comically gestures to make her point\] to see it. This is ridiculous. Don't you have a different room with a better view? I've stayed here before, in a Junior Suite, and it had a much better view. I want to stay in that room.

Me: Well, I can see if we have it... \[type type type\] Unfortunately, I don't have a Junior Suite with a Lake View for your 4 night stay...

Mrs. Shiny: WELL, the room ALSO smells like URINE! Do you have that other type of room for tomorrow? Or the NEXT day? Or ANY day of our stay? I don't want to STAY in the PEE ROOM!

Me: \[already tired of the tone this lady is taking with me, time to throw in the towel\] Okay, I'm just going to go get my manager to speak with you.

Mrs. Shiny: \[she literally scoffs at me after I say this\] Perrrfect.

I go back to my MOD, who is a bit new, but handles guests pretty well. I explain what's going on, and I tell her straight up that this guest is being amazingly rude. I guess it's because it's a slow day, but I don't have the patience for being talked to like that. She understands, and goes out to talk to them. Mrs. Shiny has disappeared, but Mr. Shiny is still there to talk to the MOD.

Now, I don't really know where the misunderstanding came from, but my manager put them in a Junior Suite... but not one with a Lake View, which is a different room type in our system. I notice this pretty quickly, and I know that Mrs. Shiny isn't going to accept this, and they will be back down within 15 minutes after the bellman (the same one they ignored earlier) helps them move. My manager apologized and says she will talk to them from here on out since she made that mistake. And so, we wait together for the inevitable at the front desk.

Like clockwork, I see them turn the corner, storming towards us. Their immediate demand, after throwing the room keys at my manager, is that we refund them entirely and cancel their stay. And that is exactly what she did, and as they walked out the door, we felt a storm dissipate.

The original room never smelled like urine, vouched by the bellman and the housekeeping supervisor who went to look at it after all this, and the view is the same as it always is: you just turn your head to the left to see the lake. They also told the bellman that they expected full-service treatment considering their Super Special Shiny... even thought they were specifically told we are a full service hotel, they just didn't want to wait for it, and completely ignored the person who was offering to help them when he did return.

And just like that, with one simple mistake from my MOD that could have been rectified with a little bit of patience, I don't have to deal with these people for the next 4 days, who I am sure would have plenty more to complain about.

I just love it when everything works out. :)",18,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CD80F5E0>
922,I can't give you what doesn't exist,"I will of course be ME in this situation, we will call the guest ML for mistaken lady. and D for her daughter

It was a smooth check in. The lady with her 2 teen kids was very friendly. We laughed a bit and I did my spiel, gave her the room keys and sent her on the way. It was about 10 minutes later when it all changed.

She came downstairs with a scowl on her face. She began to scream

""THIS IS NOT THE ROOM I BOOKED! WE WANT WHAT IS IN THE PICTURE!!!!""

I began to scowl beneath my mask thinking, ""here we go"" according to her [Puking.com](https://Puking.com) reservation she got exactly what she booked.

Me: ""Well, please show me what you booked please and I will see if I have that room available and give you a complimentary upgrade for the night since it is very slow.""

As she pulls out her phone to pull up the photo she begins to speak

ML: ""Not what I booked at all. The photo on your website is different.""

Her fingers were moving like the Flash and she pulls up a photo and shoves the phone toward me to where I can see it. What I notice is it was a single photo that was saved to her phone. Not a web page. Nope. 

ML: ""see! THIS, is what I booked.""

I look again to make sure that I am seeing what I am seeing.

ME: ""Well, I do apologize, however, that photo is not of any of the rooms in this hotel.""

ML: ""YOU DO HAVE IT! IT WAS ON YOUR WEBSITE!""

ME: ""I'm sorry. However, that room type does not exist here. I am unable give you what doesn't exist. I suggest you go to the actual website and look again.""

ML: ""No! I booked this room here! This is why I chose this place!""

ME: ""Well, I'm sorry ma'am but as I already said, that photo is of a room type that does not exist on this property. please go to the actual website and double check.""

She didn't accuse me of lying. Instead she sat across the desk from me on the leather sofa and had her teenage daughter pull up the website on her phone as she stared a death stare at me. I watch as her daughter leans over scrolling the phone and showing her the room types and photos. The daughter even said 

D: ""See mom, this is what we booked and the photo is correct."" 

I see them going through more things on the phone and then I hear....

D: ""what you showed him is the picture of the place we are staying in Milwaukee tomorrow.""

ML who was staring at me the entire time with that death stare, suddenly tried to hide the embarrassment on her face. She got up for the sofa. walked by the desk without saying a word or even glancing at me. and disappeared to the elevators. 

The daughter got up. came to me and gave me an awesome apology.

The whole time I'm thinking ""How the hell do you only download a photo and not screenshot the whole page? I can't give you what doesn't exist!""",47,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CD80F550>
923,"""I can get it cheaper online"" lol sure","My hotel makes a point of keeping rates advertised online the same as the rates we have at the desk. The only exception is when people are booking through something like triple A or arp or something, or when using the brand to redeem points or one of their other discount offers.

Anyhoo, we were sold out save for one no show last night. So this morning when someone came trying to do an early check in, that's the only room I had available.

A woman walks up around check out time. I asked if she was checking out and she said no, checking in.

>Bran- Okay, I have one room available for early check in. It's a nonsmoking king. It will be $XX after tax.

>Guest- Oh, I can get it cheaper online.

[Me internally](https://redd.it/qttqoe)

>Bran- Okay, just make sure you have the right date and room type selected before you book.

Usually people go through the whole booking rigmarole only to find it will be the same price, so I just let people do their thing instead of arguing.

>Guest- Okay, I just booked it, do you see it?

>Bran- Not yet, it usually takes a few minutes when you book online.

And after a few minutes, sure enough it popped up.

>Bran- Alright, so looks like you booked a nonsmoking queen room. I don't have any of those ready yet. So you're welcome to come back at 3, otherwise I can upgrade you to the king room for $XX

Which brought the total to the exact price I'd initially quoted her. Her face fell, but she agreed to pay it. If I'd really wanted to be mean I would have made her pay an early check in fee, but that's not my style today.",34,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CD80F0D0>
924,Grumpy guest,"So I'm no longer behind the front desk, but I am staying at a lacking tea while we close on our new house. We've been here about a month, expect to move in right before Christmas. 

Since before we started staying the side door doesn't work very well from the outside. A bit annoying as a smoker and most of the parking lot is on that side. 

There is a big red sign in all caps **PLEASE DO NOT PROP THE DOOR OPEN!** (also there is a sign stating the door is broken and please use other door)

WELL.  there's a dog show in town and they're all propping open the door. I have looked people in the eye as I kick away the rock or straighten the mat.

Edited to add: the courtyard doesn't even latch, they could take their dogs out there. Or through the front door.  But no, they have to prop open the door. It's a longer walk to the grass from the side door than it is from the courtyard or front.",10,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CD80F070>
925,Where are those 10 dollar rooms we heard about?,"I’ve decided to be more proactive in sharing some of my best tales from my days working as a front desk manager. To put this story into context, I used to work at one of the top hotels in Bangkok, and I’m also able to speak a few languages, particularly German. Obviously happened way before Covid but I just saw a memory on my Facebook reminding me of this gem.

It was the afternoon shift and moderately busy, I’m standing at the desk updating guest profiles and it was just the beginning of the rush from the Emirates flight that lands in the afternoon, which is usually filled with transfers from Europe. In walks this lovely young backpacker stereotype couple who look like they’ve just raided the bargain bin from H&M. No judgements here, but I’ve worked this job long enough to know what was about to transpire.

I was happy to call them to my lane and welcome them with the cold towels and fresh passion fruit juice after their long journey. They plopped their brand new German passports on the counter, making it clear they haven’t travelled much and in fairly broken English said they wanted a suite for a few nights. I responded in their native tongue, their faces lit up that not only will they be staying at one of the nicest hotels in town, but now also have a dedicated concierge to ask every question they have ever had. During an exchange of pleasantries I discovered that they have travelled across the globe without booking anything at all and were just gonna wing it in true backpacker spirit, thus they were beginning their adventure with a walk in booking.

We continue to chat away while I browse through rates in Opera, madame asks for a second glass of passion fruit juice and I got everything sorted and scribble some options and rates on the nice hotel letterhead with the gold ink and all that good stuff. I tell them one of the nicest suites is currently available and if they were willing to book and pay for 3 nights I could even give them 20% off their room rate and comp the breakfast. They were ecstatic. I show them my paper with the junior suite pricing, a mere 45,000 Baht for the 3 nights. The husband says that is probably fine, but if I could just calculate the dollar equivalent for them. I’m of course happy to oblige, and tell them the exchange rate is usually around 30 Baht to the dollar, so this comes to roughly 1,500 USD or 500 a night.

They both freeze. She was just about to finish her second glass of the juice and quickly put it down. BUT THESE ARE EUROPEAN PRICES!?!?

So I told them that if this is over their budget I’m happy to drop the price a bit further or perhaps they would like to consider taking a standard room. The husband leans a bit closer to me to avoid the other guests overhearing and says “we read you can get rooms for around 10 dollars a night in Bangkok”. So then I explain to them that yes it is possible. Over at Khaosarn Road, the backpacker Mecca of Thailand. But it’ll probably have a fan instead of an AC and is between a bar and the McDonald’s. 

They are in shock. Who would have thought that a fancy hotel in Thailand would be expensive. I told them to have a seat in the lobby, gave them some Wi-Fi codes and recommended them some websites to start looking at for their accommodation needs. After a while they came back and said they found something suitable, which turned out to be exactly the place next to the McDonald’s as I expected, and if I could call them a taxi to go there.

I walked them out of the lobby to the car, told the driver where to send them and as I bade farewell, she asked me if I knew whether that hotel would have a German speaking front desk staff to assist them. I said most likely not in that budget range. 

Did give them my business card and told them to reach out if they needed any help but never heard back from them again.

TLDR: German couple travels overseas for the first time in their lives and thinks every hotel should cost 10 dollars a night cuz it’s a developing country",82,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CD80F460>
926,Anyone Else Feel That Guest Entitlement is At an All Time High?,"I know it was always high, but something about the last 2 years has made it seem like it's shot through the roof lately. This is only one of many similar stories over the last few months. 

This guy shows up to check in, right about the time I clock in for NA. He's got a high-level rewards membership and is doing a points/cash stay, so about half the rate is paid by point, the rest on a card, plus incidentals of course. Well, this guy had his main credit card stolen before he arrived, so he wanted to switch cards. No problem. The cash rate is like $80 before tax since the rest is on points. None of his other credit cards authorize. Not one. Not even his debit card. 

He asks me what I want him to do. I tell him he's got 2 options. He can either find the money to pay for the room, or find somewhere else to stay, as we cannot let him occupy a room that has no payment secured. Seems reasonable to all you other FDA's, Supervisors, Managers, and non-hotel folk who read our stories, right? WRONG! This guy launches into a curse-fueled rant that \[INSERT MASSIVE HOTEL BRAND HERE\] can take the loss on giving one free room away for a high level rewards member. I see his reward status, so obviously I know how incredibly important he is, and how much money he spends at \[INSERT MASSIVE HOTEL BRAND HERE\]. 

Except he doesn't have the points for a free night. I tell this jackass that first, he needs to calm down and speak to me with a minimal level of respect. Second, I do in fact see his *father's* reward number on file (same name, but reward profile says it's for a MR. NAME SR, and this guy is mid to late twenties, tops). Third, if I make an exception like this for him, I have to make it for everyone of the same rewards status level. Fourth, I'm not giving him a room without a valid payment method secured. I'll return the points to him if he wants to go somewhere else - he says another hotel brand that has a property in the area accepts Apple Pay and that he has enough money that way, but we don't so he's more than welcome to leave. 

He then demands, not asks, *demands* my Venmo so he can have me put *my* card down for him. Not happening, dumbass, I don't trust you motherfuckers with my extra phone charger, I'm *not* trusting you with my debit or credit card. I tell him no. He tells me to call my GM, and he'll authorize a free room. I tell him the GM will tell him exactly what I'm telling him, but if it'll help I'll give him a call. Sure enough my GM tells me not to give this asshole a room if he can't pay for it. That's hard cheese, douchebag, I know, but it's not happening. 

After I inform this guy of my GM supporting my call, he steps behind the desk pod, obviously trying to intimidate me, and tells me my GM is stupid and selfish and can take the loss for one night for such a high level member and I *will* give him a key. Upon having my personal space violated, I put my hand on this guy's chest and calmly, but firmly force him out of my space. I've been on NA for a long time, and people have pulled the craziest shit on me over the years. Unless someone actually pulls a weapon on me, I'm really not worried and know that most people of just full of shit and like to act tough. Yawn. I tell him to leave. 

""But I have a reservation!"" No, dumbass, you *had* a reservation, which has now been canceled. I inform him that he's got approximately 30 seconds to leave before I call the police to make him leave. I tell him he's been here a grand total of 30 minutes and done nothing but curse at and yelled at, and attempted to threaten and intimidate me. He leaves. I immediately lock the front doors. 

He shows up multiple times throughout the rest of the night, stymied by the locked door. The first time, I get on the intercom and tell him to leave or I'll call the cops. Again. He leaves. Second time, I get on the intercom and tell him I *am* calling the cops. He books it. Third time, I see him on his phone outside the door and think he's probably trying to call the hotel to convince me or berate me or threaten me or whatever, but the phone rings and who should be on the other end, but this asshole's father! And let me tell you folks, the apple fell *very* far from the tree. The father says he wants to pay for his son's room, and I inform the father that his son has done nothing but curse at and threaten me and that I'm literally calling the cops on my cellphone right then because his son refuses to leave the property. The father sighs, as if this isn't the first time he's been told this by someone, tells me he's very sorry for his son's behavior and hangs up. As I'm on the phone with police giving a description of this guy, his truck and that he won't stay away, I see the son having what looks to be a heated, and rather whiny exchange with whom I can only assume is his dad. The son's eyes go wide and he books it, once more. 

The police swung by a few times throughout the night to make sure he didn't return.",48,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CD80F3A0>
927,A Short Story With A Nice Ending,"This happened a few months ago, I work at a large resort in Florida.

So, a guest comes to the desk saying that he thinks he left his phone in one of the pool towels when he returned them. So we go to the laundry room and the pool towels for the day have yet to be touched. So I wheel the cart with the pool towels into the next room and dump the cart of towels on the floor so that it's easier to sift through the towels. Within a few minutes of sifting, we find the phone. The guest thanks me and offers to help me pick the towels up. I tell him no, he thanks me again and departs. I put the towels away, and go about the rest of my day. 

The next day I get told there's a card for me in the back office. I go and open the card, It's a thank you card with a $25 Amazon gift card inside. There's a little note thanking me for helping find his phone. This touched me a bit, most people just leave it at ""Thanks"".",16,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CDEC07F0>
928,Why must I suffer for others’ mistakes?,"Hey there, another tale from your favorite Appalachian-turned-urban night auditor. Tonight has been one of those nights. It’s already a Saturday night in the downtown area of a major metropolitan city, but PM shift decided that my shift wasn’t going to be horrid enough as it was.

When I arrive, we are oversold by six. PM has not notified any of these people that we don’t have any rooms for them. As if that weren’t bad enough, every other hotel in our price range is sold out in a 25 mile radius. There’s hope though, there’s a few rooms that are Vacant/Dirty in my system that maybe I can clean enough to look presentable, and maybe, just maybe, the rest won’t show up. I double and triple check the system to make sure that these rooms are Vacant, I go up to the door and knock. No answer. Good, I open the door to see someone passed out under the covers in one of the beds. If there is such thing as a God, I pray that I was unseen as I bolted out of the room. Check the other rooms, same story. Fuck it, I don’t get paid enough to figure out who these people are or why they’re in these rooms.

Next plan, I locate and secure six rooms at a sister property of a similar quality thirty minutes away at a rack rate $50 lower than our rate tonight. It’s not perfect by any rate, but it’s something, and tonight, that’s good enough for me. I call all the guests, and three answer. I inform them of the situation, including the rooms we have saved at the other property, and to say they were less than pleased is an understatement. I get it, it’s on us since our hotel oversold, but Jesus if being on the phone having to explain it isn’t excruciating.

Two more who didn’t answer came in and so again began the song, dance, apologies and prostrations. Two more angry customers leave my hotel and here I sit, two and a half hours left on my shift, hoping that last one doesn’t come in. I’d say that I’m going to nurse my sorrows with some Jefferson’s Reserve and video games when I get home, but I have a tattoo appointment at 2:00 PM and so I’ll be working again tomorrow night with very little sleep and even less patience.",12,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CDABCEE0>
929,So apparently I’m rude and a racists,"The hotel I work out doesn’t allow leisure guests, we have a gate and you have to show a badge from the company in order to get in., not like it’s that big of a deal because most of the people come in through the airport shuttle. Well sometimes leisure guests slip through. Either through the airport shuttle or they get in through the gate. Usually they’re understanding. Not this couple.

It is 5pm and I’m two hours into my shift. I watch them park in front with their motorcycle. They arrive at the same time as the airport shuttle and five guest exit out. They end up being last in line, well she is. He hasn’t come in while I checked in the other people. So I finish checking them in and it is her turn,

“You got any available rooms?” She asks.

I shake me head, “so sorry ma’am we”re booked,” I say. 

“You lyin’ the parking lot is empty, how u booked?”

In walks the guy and she whispers to him. 

“You sayin’ you fully booked?” He asks.

“Yes sir a-“ I start to say.

But he interrupts me. “The parking lot is empty, we got money, we just need to stay a night.”

I really don’t like being interrupted. Like if he would have let me explain, but I bite my tongue and do my sugary voice. “I understand but a company bought our company and we’re only allowed guest from this company, meaning we’re fully booked.”

The lady smacks her mouth. “Yeah right, you just don’t want to give us a room because we black.”

I have to hold in my laughter. Like seriously, they just said that to me. Me. I am black. I am dark skin black with natural hair that I wear out all the time. And she watched me check in a black guy that was in front of her.

And that is what grinds my gears, she really tried to play the race card. I am so sick of people playing the race card when unnecessary because when it is necessary no one will take it seriously.

I am also stunned on how to respond, how do you respond to be called racist when that’s the last thing you are. I take a second and decide to talk to them carefully. “I am so sorry I don’t understand what you mean by that but that is furthest from the truth. A company bought us out so we aren’t taking in anyone that doesn’t work for this company and the empty parking lot wouldn’t be a good indication if we’re booked or not, before the buyout our guest arrived through the airport shuttle. But that’s beside the point. I’m sorry for the inconvenience.”

She smacks her mouth again and takes the guys hand. They walk out. I am thankful, the interaction is over… so I thought. Nope I hear the lady call me a rude bitch. Thank goodness for one of the shuttle drivers I adore who heard this and was like, “excuse me?” She was walking in to use the restroom.

The young man tells her that I was rude and refused them a room. I can’t help but laugh.

Shuttle driver informs them, “that’s surprising, she’s one of the sweetest people who work here. She can’t give you a room because a company bought out the hotel and only people who work for the company can stay here.”

They thought I was lying? What do I gain for lying?

They hop onto their motorcycle and drive off. Fun stuff people.",13,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CDABCCA0>
930,Entitled regulars,"So I’m sure this is a common issue for all of us but this has been happening a lot at our hotel recently. One of the incidents that took place recently is that we have this guest who is a regular and the room she was staying in since few nights was apparently having issues. 

She told us that her lock won’t work on the 3rd night of her stay and we were at full occupancy that day but thankfully I had one room on hold for emergency which was the same room type as she was staying in (classic queen) so I happily offered to move her to the vacant clean room. 

Her reaction was that she was extremely offended because I did not offer her a “free upgrade” to a more expensive room. I tried to explain that we did not have any other room types available to move her in and also applied a discounted rate for her room for the remainder of the nights she was staying with us.

She then goes on to tell me “I deserve an upgrade because I’ve spent up to $30000 at your property so I deserve a free upgrade”, now I know for a fact that the old management used to make a lot of exceptions for this guest that included no deposits and giving her breakfast food for free whenever she wanted so I guess she was used to being treated special but nevertheless I told her I can’t do it because it’s out of my authority and new manager doesn’t allow upgrades if room is already booked for someone else and they’re paying full price 

I move her to the vacant room and when i come in for my shift the next morning, and guess what? our front desk manager who is best friends with this lady moved her into a more expensive suite (executive king room)  and switched the room of the guest who paid full price for that room to a lower rated room. I was shocked that she did this in spite of us not having spare rooms and addressed this issue to our GM because this lady did NOT PAY for her last night when she checked out and the FOM ended up paying and her excuse was that “she is going to feel so bad because she forgot to pay”. 

We need to stop treating such entitled people like they’re royal because it created a bad impression of our organization in front of guests who actually do bother to pay full price and treat us with respect!",34,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CDABCBB0>
931,$132.21 total for a four night stay? Yeah right.,"Our hotel is within 10 miles of a Ford assembly plant, and we get a lot of guests staying with us that are affiliated with Ford, either as a direct employee or a sub-contractor coming in to do work at the plant. The Ford rate is $117 + tax, which is a substantial savings off of our rack rate.

So anyway, had a guy check in Friday night that had a reservation for four nights with the Ford rate. We progress thru the check-in process and when we get to the point where he needs to insert his card into the card reader (yes, we require guests at check-in to insert their card into the card reader. GM says it's to help cut down on fraud), he freaks out over the amount of his stay (plus incidental hold) showing on the screen. He wants to know why it's so much when he was told the rate was $117 + tax for his stay. I told him the total showing was for $117 + tax PER NIGHT, plus the incidental hold. He starts screaming at me, saying he was told when he made the reservation that the total would be ""just $132 for my whole stay."" I told him he must have misunderstood the reservation agent, because ""do you really think you'd get a room here for four nights for just $132 bucks?"" He says yes and goes on to say that if he knew he was going to have to pay over $500, he would have made a reservation somewhere else.

At this point, I was getting tired of him yelling at me, so I tell him that if he would prefer to stay somewhere else, I could cancel the check-in process and cancel his reservation, or he can have his card authorized for the full amount and be on his way to his room. He threatened to call corporate and have me fired. I told him to have at it as I wasn't in the wrong. After steaming and stewing for a few more minutes, he finally decides he wants to stay, and we finish the check-in process. As he walks away from the front desk, he says that he will be speaking with my manager in the morning. I tell him that the GM won't be in until Monday morning (this was Friday night approx 1115pm), but our AGM would be at 900am Saturday morning. He says he'll wait to talk to the ""big boss"" on Monday.

As an added ""bonus,"" he calls down about 30 minutes later, saying that when he made his reservation, he requested a smoking room, but didn't see an ashtray in his room. I tell him that all of our rooms are non-smoking, and if he wanted to smoke, he would need to go outside to do so. I got treated to yet another verbal assault so I just hung up on him. Thankfully, I didn't have any more interactions with him for the rest of the night and hopefully I won't for the remainder of his stay.

Remind me again why I do this job. LOL",182,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CDABCB80>
932,Someone threw up in the towels,"*Disclaimer: As you can see from the title, this story is about puke. If that sort of stuff grosses you out or bothers you, maybe skip this one*


I haven't been working in hotels that long, so I can only assume I'm going to have many more disgusting discoveries much worse than this one. Regardless, I wanted to share anyway. 

So I'm about 30 minutes into my NA shift, just got my paperwork done and I'm going to close the pool down and shut off the lights. The hamper is full when I get in there so I figure I'll wash and dry the dirty towels for housekeeping tomorrow. I gather up the loose ones, wheel it back to our laundry room and start chucking the towels into the washer. That's when I see it, bright neon green on one of the towels. My coworker had mentioned a birthday party before she left so I assumed one of the kids had just used a towel as a napkin after eating cake. No worries, I'd just put that one aside so it didn't make a mess in the washer. As I'm moving the affected towel I notice chunks and soon after the smell hit me. Let me tell you I dropped that towel so fast when I realized what it was. No way in hell was I dealing with that. I left a note for the next shift and wrote ""BEWARE!!! Vomit on towels"" on a few pieces of paper and stuck them to the hamper and washer I had already thrown some towels into. I'm just glad it's not my job to deal with that sort of thing and boy do I feel bad for whoever gets stuck with that tomorrow. Not very eventful, but pretty darn nasty.",14,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CDB000A0>
933,Can you call your manager?,"It's a super busy weekend and every hotel in town is sold out at VERY high prices.  The reason is pretty obvious and every local would know this.  This local comes in around 11pm looking for a room.  

G - guy  M - me

M: Hi how can I help you?

G: I need a room at a decent price.  The heater at my house went out.

M: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that!  I hate to be the bearer of bad news but we are sold out as is every hotel in town.  Even if you find a room the price is going to be insane.  

G: So, you don't have ANYTHING?

M: No, I'm sorry we don't

G: Well, I'm in a tough spot, can you call your manager to see what he can do about this?  

M: Sir, I am the manager and unfortunately there's nothing I can do.  I don't have a room to give you.  

G: Well what am I supposed to do???

M: Um...I'm not sure, do you know anyone in town that might let you crash on their couch or something?

G: No.

M: The only other suggestion I have is to grab some blankets.  If you're still without heat tomorrow you can come back and we can definitely help you out.

G: *storms out*



Call my manager about being sold out?  Even if I wasn't the manager, I obviously wouldn't call them about what we should do when someone is looking for a room and we are sold out.... especially at 11pm.  I'm so confused by that question.",92,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CDB00BB0>
934,Oh no! Our elevator! It's broken!,"I *just* clocked in and today's already been a wild ride. Folks, we're in for a treat tonight because out of all the things that could go wrong today, a power surge knocked out our main elevator! My GM was even lucky enough to get stuck in there for 2 hours this morning too! He had to shimmy up the elevator shaft because it was stuck between the first and second floor. We have some mechanics here now trying to fix it, but they just called in another guy so it won't be functional for a minute.

An hour has gone by since starting this post and as predicted, guests are not pleased. We do have another elevator, but it's in no way connected to the main building and no matter how you describe the location it's a confusing spot. We're also in the midst of our first snowfall of the season, so the outdoor-only access point only adds insult to injury.

Pray for me y'all, this is gonna be one hell of a night. As of this moment, the elevator mechanics are calling in someone from the next city over and hopefully they'll be able to fix it. (and yes i'll provide updates if it ever gets fixed, i won't leave you guys hanging like that)

UPDATE: It's been fixed! 13 hours after the initial outage, we have a functioning main elevator again! ",52,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CDB008B0>
935,What a Night," Trigger Warning: Domestic Violence

I work at a luxury hotel smack dab in the center of downtown in a biggish Southern city. This weekend we're sold out with a couple of wedding parties, a large cable sports network in town covering a local college football game, and other assorted people. Probably our last busy weekend of the year. Among our amenities are 24 hour valet service and room service for breakfast that you can order by filling out a limited menu and hanging it on your doorknob to be collected over night.

This morning at about quarter after three one of the people with the cable network calls me at the front desk complaining about noise from the room next door, which is occupied by a couple who had just gotten married earlier that day. Since my overnight valet is up on the floors collecting breakfast hangers I text him and ask him to swing by room XXX and ask them to pipe down. I'm assuming that they're partying and maybe playing their music too loud or something, and hoping that it's not something embarrassing like their newlywed throws of passion being too loud. A few minutes later my trusty valet, who I will be calling Kevin here, calls my cell and tells me that the couple are fighting and that he definitely heard the man hit the woman. I tell him to stay up there and monitor the situation and I'll call the cops.

A police officer arrives about 20 long minutes later and I send him up to the room and tell him that Kevin is up there telling the people who are now coming out of their rooms to see what the noise is to keep calm and return to their rooms, while recording the sound on his phone. There's about five minutes of audio where you can clearly hear the woman tell her brand new husband that he had broken her nose along with assorted yelling and a couple of very clear crashes and well, I don't know if they were punches, but they sounded a lot more substantial than slaps..

Of course when the cop arrives on the scene she answers the door and according to Kevin denies everything despite the bloody nose and bruises. I texted Kevin back and told him that either way the newlyweds' hotel privileges had been revoked and they had to leave now. Thankfully the officer doesn't take her word for it, and a half hour later walks Mr. Newlywed out to his squad car in handcuffs. Mrs. Newlywed was still upstairs asking Kevin if he knew of any 24 hour bail bondsmen in town. The cop comes back in with a pamphlet on domestic violence with tips on how to escape the situation and numbers to call and whatnot.

If I live to be a thousand I will never forget the look on that motherfucker's face as he was walked out of a $700/night hotel at 4am in handcuffs. Smug, not quite a grin, but clearly quite satisfied with himself and not an ounce of fear. There's a special place in Hell for that piece of shit.

So that was my night. How was yours?

I'm gonna cry for a little bit, make some breakfast, and go to bed.

Oh, and if you're in an abusive relationship, get out. There are people and places there to help you, no matter how dire your situation may seem, and no matter your partner has told you and made you believe, you're worth it.",81,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CDB004C0>
936,Our Coffee dispensers don’t have drains.,"So we’re doing some renovations right now and our big coffee dispensers/pots are all currently on a card table in the lobby instead of their normal area.  You’d think that anyone who looks at the setup would be able to tell that there is no drain anywhere but that didn’t stop a guy this morning from upending a full sized tumbler of day-old coffee into the trap under the spigot.  Coffee goes everywhere and splashes up on the guy while I hurry over to start cleaning up.  He doesn’t apologize for making a mess and instead complains about getting coffee stains on his clothing.  He asks me what I’m going to do about it and I ask him what he means by that. He says, ‘The drain on your coffee machine is broken and it’s your responsibility to make sure that things like this don’t happen.’

I told him I’d be with him in a few minutes after I cleaned up the mess.  Then I made a point of moving all of the coffee pots off the table and then moving it away from the wall so I can start cleaning up the floor.  I think he realized that there wasn’t a drain of any sort because he walked off pretty quickly and I haven’t heard from him since.",31,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CDB00220>
937,How can it be my problem?,"It's a bit past midnight and a guest, visibly annoyed ahead of arrival to our lovely property, is approaching front-desk.

We welcome/greet him as we do with all of our guests. It's a check-in...

Clickety-click... back and forth about the reservation details, and we are at the payment stage. Yes, we at our properties take payment up-front.

^(A-side note: For some reason, corporate tested and decided that having authorizations on cards each night, was not feasible option, so they went with, no credit card authorizations, but payment up front. Which did not cover really, incidental charges, as these were still possible but no coverage was in place. So in essence, a guest would be able to pay with a card, block it for additional charges, spend big money in bars and restaurants, and leave without settling. But i guess (i hope) that did some calculations on that part...) 

Okay, back to the subject... 

So, his card is being declined for payment... he wants us to try again... 

But result is still the same... transaction is being declined... 

So we apologies, and ask if guest has another card that he can settle with... 

\- No, i do not have another card...

\- This card is not working, sir. So you will not be able to proceed... 

\- But, how is it my problem you can't charge my card?

\*itchy.... itchy...\*

\- Well... if you do not pay, you do not get a room... not sure if that qualifies as your problem or mine... but that is how it works here. 

\- Ok, let me try this card than... 

\- That one works... Maybe you should talk to your bank regarding that other card... 

\- No no it works... 

\- Ok... Enjoy your stay with us...",57,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CDB00940>
938,A Unicorn Of A Boss,"Wow, look at me two tales in one night! But this one is actually kind of feel good so I think y'all are gonna enjoy it. 

So, to set the stage, I've just finished my dinner and posted my tale of the woman who called my basic human need for food ""unprofessional"" (idk how to add links otherwise i'd put it here), when I'm greeted with a family wanting to check in. From the start they're already kinda huffy but they're from way out of state and appeared to have driven here so I cut them some slack. The mother of the group gives her last name and that's when shit hits the fan. We don't have her reservation and we're sold out. *Okay Anarchy, don't panic, just make sure she's at the right hotel and go from there.* I ask for a confirmation email with no luck, they're absolutely POSITIVE they booked here.  

A little clarification on my brand's unique flaw really quick: We're a locally owned and operated boutique hotel and restaurant chain with three hotels all within a mile of each other on the same road. There's also only one central number to call to reach all of the hotels, and their in-house restaurants and spas. The phone directory is very clear though and like all businesses we open all calls with the name of our respective hotel/restaurant/spa. This doesn't stop people from putting the wrong location into their gps, but most are very cooperative and apologetic when they show up at the wrong place. These particular guests are not most people as you could've guessed.

So from my understanding they denied putting an email on file for the confirmation email, confident they booked at our location. I tell them we've been sold out for this weekend since Tuesday, and my phone has been silent for the last two hours. Thankfully, I have access to our sister hotel's system and inform them they're about a quarter mile up the road at that property. That was a bad decision apparently on my part as nw the whole family, including the grandma is harping on me. All of them are continuously raising their voice to talk over the others and in an echo-y lobby, the volume is only amplified that much more. I have sensory issues with loud sounds being one of the worst offenders, as well as ptsd concerning anyone raising their voice around me. I start shutting down. 

Each still on their own tirades about how I'm awful and incompetent, they finally make their way out the door allowing me to break down. I drop to the floor and start sobbing and rocking back and forth, hitting myself for letting these assholes get under my skin after I've gone so long without incident. And who emerges from the restaurant? My boss, aka the owner of the hotel and restaurant. *Shit, I'm gonna get fired for acting like this.*

To my surprise that prediction was dead wrong, he actually gets down next to me and asks me what happened. I sputter out the events of the last 15 minutes and this sweet, blessed man tells me ""Anarchy, fuck those assholes. You're one of my best employees if not *THE* best employee I have. You're awesome at your job here and guests have nothing but good things to say about you. Go cool off, I'll call the other property and tell them those people can't stay because of how they treated you. Call me next time guests get out of hand, I promise you'll never be bothering me"" (paraphrasing, but this is pretty much his whole speech) 

When I tell y'all I was crying even harder after he said that! After having too many shitty managers, this was such a shock an employer would accomodate me in this way. I cooled off for about 20 minutes in my car because if I was actually taking my time I'd just go home, and came back inside where he reassured me again he's always got my back in situations like that. I thanked him and with that he went back to the restaurant. 

I know a lot of you have pretty awful management teams and I wanted to share this to say there's still good managers in this world, even if they're horribly outnumbered by the bad. Hopefully this put a smile on your face instead of envy in your heart, and if the latter is true, i sincerely hope you find an employer ike mine in the near future. Much love to everyone in this sub, and wishing you all a calm, karen-free weekend <3",29,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CDB00310>
939,Yes! Commit a crime as you tell me I'm a bad person! That'll show me!,"On mobile, yadda yadda...

Due to the nature of our location our attached restaurant has a 'no backpacks' policy. It also has VLT machines. Buddy Boy (BB) wanted to use said VLTs. BB has a backpack. With his mask around his chin, he asked me to hold his bag for him at the desk.

Now, we have a 'no holding people's personal items' rule as 1) we could be responsible for someone's items if something happens to them and 2) its a freaking pandemic. I explained these rules to BB. BB then asked if he could leave his bag on the lobby sofa, to which I said no, because PANDEMIC and it's check out time so people are coming through the lobby right now. I'd like to think I was being nice about it, BB disagreed.

BB: you always do this. You guys always turn me away. I don't wanna pull the race card but I always have issues trying to get in here.

Me: I'm very sorry about that, but I don't determine the rules.

BB: I bet you don't do this to white people with backpacks in there!

Me: are there people with backpacks in the restaurant? If you'd point them out I'll have someone deal with them as well.

BB: you're just a racist B****! You're forcing business away cuz you're racist!

Me: like I said... if you'd point out anyone else with a backpack...

BB: F*** YOU! Racist b****!

BB then proceeds to walk out of the lobby, PULLING THE FIRE ALARM as he goes.

Yup. You sure showed me! By pulling a fire alarm.... on camera..... and not wearing your mask...... Yup! I've been OWNED!",52,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CDB002B0>
940,"""ThAt'S uNpRoFeSsIoNaL!""","A short but irksome tale for y'all this fine friday evening. Everyone's least favorite fda, yours truly, had just sat down to enjoy a lovely microwaved cup of mac and cheese for five minutes. This was my first break I've had time for all week and was ecstatic to eat before 11pm for once. I hadn't even poured in the cheese powder yet when I heard a shrill ""HeLlOoOoOoO! DoEs AnYbOdY wOrK hErE?!"" from the lobby. I sigh and dread what's about to come. 

A couple stands at my desk, the wife looking like the Mega-Boss of Karens, and I apologize for any wait  and explain I was just trying to go on my lunch break. Mega-Karen was not pleased with this answer. 

For the following dialogue, I'll be ""Me"" for myself, and Mega-Karen will be ""MK""

MK: ""WeLl ThAt'S eNtIrElY uNpRoFeSsIoNaL!!!!!""

Me: ""I'm sorry you feel that way, what can I help you with today?""

MK: ""DoEs YoUr BoSs KnOw AbOuT tHeSe BrEaKs YoU tAkE????""

Me: ""Yes ma'am he does, and he encourages me to take them as our state mandates 30 minute lunch breaks for all employees who work 8 hours or more. That aside, is there anything I can do for you? Checking in perhaps?' 

MK: ""StAtE mAnDaTeD bReAkS?!?!????!!!! WhAt HaS mY wOrLd CoMe To????!!!! ThAt'S jUsT pOoR bUsInEsS pRaCtIcE, bEfOrE i SoLd *My* BuSiNeSs My WoRkErS *nEvEr* GoT bReAkS!!!!!""

Me: ""I'm sorry to hear that. Will you be checking in today?""

MK: ""NoT aNyMoRe!!!!! We'Ll Be StAyInG sOmEwHeRe WiTh BeTtEr BuSiNeSs PrAcTiCeS!!!!!!""

And with that, the Mega-Karen turned on her heel, dragging her husband out the door while his eyes begged for help. I once again put up my ""be back soon"" sign, and begrudgingly put my cup of mac and cheese back in the microwave to overcook. This is the first time in my year in this industry that someone has called lunch breaks ""unprofessional"" and a ""poor business practice"" but whatever, the Kraft gods have spared me from the headache she'd inevitably cause. So those of you with the time to take a lunch break tonight, enjoy it in all of it's ""unprofessional"" glory for me!",79,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CDB00FA0>

943,Cash Only Motel,"I will preface by saying that I do not work the front desk.  This is a praise/apology post for all you Front Desk workers who stay on property. 

I was traveling to a funeral in the Carolinas with my son and had my GPS point to lodging nearby. All the lodging was an hour away except for a motel within 10 minutes of the funeral.  I'm a smoker, so I prefer outside entrance motels anyway, so we went there.  

I was a little off put by the office and how barricaded things were. I can only assume from the pandemic.  We rang the doorbell for service and attempted to interact with the front desk lady. Through some language barriers we were able to confirm that it was indeed Cash Only (there was a sign...I did read it, just didn't believe it after the tales I've read here). I confirmed the price was within my cash reserves and handed over the money.  At this point she told me it was a smoking room.  I was initially shocked, as I didn't believe any of those existed in the world anymore. Once I got over my shock, I reassured her that was fine and she gave me the card to fill out and asked for ID.

I'm not a Karen, the room was perfectly fine for our purpose, sleep. Though my son didn't like the firm mattress, I did.  The microwave & refrigerator were a shock for the price. 

I felt bad having to go back to the front desk and ask for the wifi for my son's computer. 

In the morning, I needed to return the key (not programmed for each stay, but hard coded to each room) and I felt so bad when it was obvious we woke the sweetheart up.  She shuffled out in her jammies and gestured to the wooden security box thru which we gave her the cash the night before.

So to all the agents who live on property, and deal with random guests interactions throughout the day & night and probably do all the cleaning and security and maintenance etc. Bless you and thank you!

944,Blind guest apparently?,"I work the night audit at a budget hotel and at about 530am i get a guest calling.  Ill try to shorten it as i can, but this guest is either a complete idiot or thinks i am...

M- Me     G- Guest

M- Hello thank you for calling blah blah blah

G- yes i was wondering why your hotel charged me $200

I get her name and look her up

M- Well it looks like it would be because you destroyed the TV in your room

G- I did no such thing

M- Ok well you may not have done it, but it was done while you were responsible for the room

G- Thats rediculous it must have been broken before we checked in

M- So you are saying that during your entire 3 day stay you not only never noticed that the TV was broken and never reported it being broken to the front desk?

G- Yeah I never even saw the TV we were barely there and we mostly just slept and left

M- So you never saw the tv that you had to walk by to go to bed, nor see the tv that is directly in front of the bed at all during your 3 day stay?

G- Thats right I never saw it, it must have happened before we checked in, cuz we would never do such a thing.

M- So you are seriously telling me you never saw the broken tv that looks as if someone tried to punch a hole through the tv?

G- There definitely was no hole in the tv

M- So you did see the tv and you lied to me about that which means the tv was fine when you checked in since you didnt feel the need to report anything about it so you wouldn't be charged for it correct?

G- HOW DARE YOU CALL ME A LIAR!

M- You just admitted to me that you did see the TV after you told me you didnt see it at all for three days, that would mean you lied to me...

G- HOW DARE YOU I WOULD NEVER PUT A HOLE THROUGH THE TV THIS IS BULLSHIT YOU ARE....

Click....I hung up on her, i wasn't going to deal with her bullshit anymore but of course she calls back

M- Thank you for calling blah blah blah

G- How dare you hang up on me what is your name?!

M- My name is Souvok

G- And your manager's name?

M- You can try and reach my manager by calling back after 9am

G- How am i supposed to say who i am calling for if you don't give me your manager's name?!

M- By asking for my manager? Like how we just identified and can recognize who we are talking about?

G- This is why you guys got a 2 star review

click -she hung up on me as i was saying the following

M- So you gave us a 2 star review for breaking our TV?

&#x200B;

I just kinda wanted to share, this person was so full of it, and to note i just didn't feel like giving her my manager's name and i didn't know which manager would be in tomorrow to talk anyways whether the GM or the AGM.  This is my first post in this community and I have no idea how to mark it as well i think it would be considered long?  Anyways i have worked in hospitality for over 15 years now, just found this forum the other day, glad to meet y'all?

Edit: Just noticed upon posting that it sets the length tag automatically

Update: My manager backed me up of course, I asked her what happened with the tv girl when i got in tonight and she said ""I said the same thing you did, you apparently broke the tv in your room and we have evidence, you were responsible for the room, then she went off saying she was going to contact the president of the parent company(we are a franchise) and the Better Business Bureau, she just kept going on and on, oh and she really HATES you apparently.""  We both laughed and i said thats probably cuz i caught her on a stupid lie.  Thats all that was said on the matter, i didnt feel like any further specifics were really needed so i didnt ask.",69,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CDB00130>
945,Breaking and Entering Scam (M),"This week we've been trying to deal with an unbelievable story.

Truly, cannot believe it.

This guest informed us on Monday that between 7 and 11 AM Saturday morning they saw the lock to their room unlock and someone tried to come in. They ran up and relocked the door only to have it unlock again, including the deadbolt. They then held their bodies against the door and screamed for help until the assailant stopped and left. The guest first told us it was a ""girl"" then it was a ""man"" that tried to get in. They tried to call the front desk with no answer before leaving without mentioning it to the staff.

Now here's the issues:

1: 7 AM and 11 AM are two VERY different times and if someone tried to break into your room you'd remember when.

2: The guest said first it was a girl then changed it to a man.  You'd remember a man or woman if that happened.

3: The hotel is over 100 years old and you can hear everything through the walls. If someone was screaming the entire hotel would hear it. Nobody else reported any noises.

4: The deadbolt can only be unlocked by the key that the maintainence guy has, who  was not on property that day.

5: The only person there before 9 was a woman weighing maybe 100 pounds who would be no match for two adults.

6: The door to that room swings outwards so if the guests did put their weight on it they would fall onto the assailant.

7: Any other person after experiencing that incident would call police and let the front desk know immediately not wait till after you got home to report it.

They called my manager yesterday appauled that nobody had called them about the incident to offer anything. Elements of the story kept changing as it was told, with the guest becoming agitated as my manager asked clarifying or probing questions to get a more clear picture of the situation. She accused our staff of trying to enter so they could get a ""peep show"", which is insulting to our staff. Without any evidence to back up the guest's report, the manager offered $50 then $100 in compensation, to which the guest then replied ""That's insulting! I won't be satisfied with anything less than a full refund AND a free night's stay!""

Not happening.

Also 8: If this happened to you at a hotel why would you want to stay there again?

Now the guest has called managers at our other locations, emailed them, called the police (whom we haven't heard from) and posted a nasty review online.

I never want to mistrust victims of any assault, but there's holes in this story you could drive a Chevy through and we are not about to give into a loud Karen trying to scam us.

Updates are sure to follow.

UPDATE 1: 

So thank you all for  your glorious support! :D 

To clarify my manager offered the partial refund out of good faith that it may've been an accidental walk-in by housekeeping (It happens), so I have no issue with her offering compensation to soothe the savage Karen. 

Also some of you asked for the guest's review, here it is edited for privacy

 ""Something fishy happening at (Op's hotel)!! Heard keys in the door, looked to see the deadbolt turning, and jumped over just in time to pull the door shut and shout that we were still there (this was an hour before checkout).  We had to hold the door shut for a few moments struggling against the person trying to open it ... they undid the deadbolt three times ... even though there was a ""do not disturb"" sign on the door.  Relaxing morning OVER.  Immediately called the front desk who didn't answer.  Packed up and left after speaking with the receptionist who seemed to be expecting us but didn't really care or offer any apology ... she promised a call from the manager.  The inn didn't answer our phone calls for 3 days ... so we tried calling from a different number, got the manager, she didn't believe the story, said no one has a key to the room, and she hung up on me.  (City) Police Department now has the details, but don't risk it ... someone in there wants a peep show, or worse.  I wonder if we'll ever hear from upper management about a refund since they're blocking our calls.  Anyway, after staying at this creative (hotel) MANY times before, we certainly won't be back."" 

And no, they didn't say anything to the front desk person. We didn't find out till Monday that this happened. 

Thanks more updates coming soon I'm sure! :D",96,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CDB00430>
946,[UPDATE] Crazier than normal unregistered guest attempting to get a key scenario ...,"\--I have been attempting to link the previous story but can't for some reason perhaps someone can do so in the comments. Thx.

Today was more hectic than normal because we were expecting an inspector for our brand to arrive today but ultimately she didn't show. The inspector arrived at several properties near ours and their GM's know mine and were sending furious texts back and forth. When I got on my GM was like a drill sergeant commanding the housekeepers to do such and such etc. Everyone was on their best behavior.

Earlier on A-shift the Fronting Mom called and asked to extend ""her"" stay (she had not arrived in person at that point). I had left detailed notes for the morning shift so they informed her she would have to come in person with ID before anything could be discussed with her concerning her reservation.

She said she would not be able to make it into town anytime soon and said we had all her info (CC etc.) on file and rented the room for 3 nights ""without incident"" and simply wanted to extend her stay for a few more days. A-shift refused and Fronting Mom then demanded a full refund for the 3 days she paid for.

A-shift refused and summarized what happened the previous day and she tried to play off sending her sister (FireAunt) saying they did so on their own accord out of concern for her children. A-shift reiterated our renting policy concerning fronting and the mom said she was staying in the room herself. A-shift asked why she didn't return the previous night to settle the issues concerning her children. They didn't tell her they reviewed the tapes and after renting the room for her kid she left the property and did not return once on the days proceeding my interaction with them.

Fronting mom said it was for a personal emergency but she would be in today in person and would appreciate it if we could extend her stay, as she gave her word, and promised she would be in later. A-shift again refused and again Fronting Mom demanded a refund. She was again refused and she resorted to claiming bed bugs. A-shift countered by saying the property had not gotten a complaint from her room during their stay from her and asked if she could verify the time she was present on property when she witnessed the BB's herself.

She couldn't so then she asked about the property in the room. She was told as she was the only registered guest on file she would have to come in person with ID before we could release any property left in the room. It went on for a bit like that and she eventually hung up.

When I get on my MOD and GM are both there directing actions for the pending arrival of the inspector. My MOD updated me on what happened and asked me to relay in detail what happened the previous day which I did. She told me the GM and herself reviewed everything and if I was contacted by them again I was allowed to refuse a refund explicitly without making any attempts to refer the matter to management and also to discuss the issue as I saw fit with FireAunt if she returned. The property in the room however could not be released without the signature of Fronting Mom. They had a hunch FireAunt would return later and attempt to claim the property in the room and guess what they were right.

A few hours into my shift FireAunt returned by herself and said she was authorized by her sister to pick up the belongings in the room. I explained that we cannot release any items from the room in question without the signature of Fronting Mom in person with proper ID. She said their jackets, clothes and other necessary items are in the room. I repeated the requirements for releasing the items and she said I personally left them on the streets the previous night without proper clothing.

I asked her if they were indeed on the streets last night and if so I'd be willing to contact child protective services. She said I did leave them on the streets personally and if she wasn't there they would have been on the streets. I asked again clearly whether they were on the streets last night as I was looking up the number for CPS at that moment and she said no they were with her.

FireAunt then pulled out her phone and began filming me informing me this video was for her lawyer. I asked whose lawyer and she said hers. I told her she is not the registered guest, nor a guest at all, so she has no legal basis for anything. She said well I'm filming you anyway. I pointed to our camera and said all their interactions with the desk have also been recorded. I told her to leave the lobby, again, as I wasn't going to rent to her.

She again asked why I wasn't releasing the stuff from the room to her. I asked for her ID and she said what do you need that for you're on camera. I asked if she rented the room in question and she said why do you need that info.

For fun I took out my phone and took a few photos of her and she became agitated and said ""Wow did you see that did you see that he took my photo WOW"" as she was filming me.

I picked out our office phone and said I'm calling the police she lowered her phone and I told her if her sister didn't show up after 3 weeks all contents from her room would be trashed.

Some people are going to ask why we didn't just hand over their stuff because kindness. That isn't how this works at all. So far the registered guest has not returned to the property at all, the minors in the room don't have ID. FireAunt may or may not be her sister. Don't lie or try to mislead hotel staff we are here to help. If you do well, you'll probably end up on this sub.",136,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CDB00F70>
947,I have 2 hours to complete the trifecta.,"I'm a night auditor at a Wyatt.  It's 5am and I'm here until 7. Nothing too interesting tonight, just some sort of trade show in town so we're full of sales types. But the phone has been ringing...

Mr. Patel called around midnight. I asked where he was calling from and he hung up immediately. My coworker had no idea what I was talking about. (No, we don't have phone scam training, why do you ask?)

And just a bit ago, I got a garbled call out of some call center. Couldn't understand a word of it, but I think I heard some Spanish in there. Nobody was responding, so I hung up. Complain to coworker about someone trying to Mr. Patel me again.

Another call, just a minute later. 
""Hello, this is Ethan from head office, I'm calling about a fire inspection—""
Fuck off.

If I get one more before my shift ends, do I get a prize?",30,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CDB001C0>
948,"Guests complains about me, to me","This happened a couple of days ago and I'm still laughing. 

I was covering the FD, while the FD person finished delivering lunch stuff and a lady comes in. The check-in goes fine and as I'm handing her the keycard she sees the FD person bringing back the trolly with a couple of dirty dishes etc. On one of the plates was a cinnamon bun. The guest points to the bun

Guest: Can I have that bun?

Me alarmed that she's about to take a bun off an obviously dirty plate

Me: Ma'am that's a dirty plate! 

G: Yeah but they didn't touch the bun. It's fine.

Me: I can't let you unfortunately 

G: Can I have a fresh one then?

M: That comes with the breakfast package and you'll get a fresh one tomorrow they're great.

G: Isn't there another one I can have?

M: We bring them in fresh each morning, one per guest, so we don't have anymore, I'm afraid. But the cafe that bakes them is about 20 steps from here, and sometimes they'll have stuff still available, but they're often sold out because they're so good!

G: You're going to eat that bun as soon as I leave aren't you?

M: I assure you ma'am I'm not. 

Guests leaves angry I won't let her eat a garbage cinnamon bun. 

Fast forward a couple of days at check-out time I get a call from FD as a customer wants to escalate a complaint about an employee. So I head to the FD and there is cinnamon bun lady (CBL).

M: Hi ma'am I can speak with you over here 

and direct her to speak with me in the waiting area

Me: I'm very sorry you've had a bad experience, can you tell me more about it so I can make things right?

CBL:  When I checked in your employee wouldn't let me have one of those free cinnamon buns and was very rude about it.

I blinked a couple of times and then it dawned on me, she had forgotten it was me. 

Me (still not quite believing she doesn't recognize me): Can you tell me what they looked like...?

CBL: Grey hair (yes!), glasses (nope), tall (complete opposite) and wasn't even in uniform! (Management has a different dress code and feel like that's the norm?) How do I know that wasn't someone just stealing my information? 

M: Alright I have their description. Did that person give you a working key card? 

CBL: Yeah.  

M: Then they would have to enter a functioning staff number to program your card, so I can assure you that was an employee. 

CBL: Well do you know who that is? 

M (still not believing this woman was being serious):....yes

CBL: Can you make sure she's not allowed to be rude anymore? People won't come back when you have staff like that. I'm going to leave a review and forward it to your boss. 

I still can't quite believe she didn't know it was me, but regardless I can't imagine getting this angry over me not letting you eat food off a strangers plate.....like...how are you not dead? 

She 100% emailed my boss her ""review"" and it's one of those reviews when you read it, it becomes immediately clear she's just extremely angry I told her ""No""

&#x200B;

TL;DR: I didn't let a lady eat a cinnamon bun off a strangers plate destined for the garbage and she got really mad about being told no.",121,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CDB00F10>
949,No coffee. Personal vendetta,"Idk why this interaction ruined my day. But like I'm stewing. I know I shouldn't let customers get to me but like why do people think they can get away with treating someone they will never see again like garbage? 

(Interaction)

Pai: OP

CoffeeWidow: customer (henceforth CW)

Cw: hey just to let you know we're out of coffee *walks away as she says this*

Pai: ok, I'll get some as soon as I can

*Paperwork intensifies and cue calls from guest that could easily be answered with googling (I honestly don't know how I got roped back in here)*

Cw: *comes back in 60 seconds or less* any coffee yet?

Pai: oh I'm sorry ma'am I forgot. Let me grab some right away. Just a cup right?

Cw: *annoyed and has her Karen smirk* yeah...

Pai: just a second...

I convince a server to get her a cup and not charge her since  if she has to get the coffee, the guest is charged money (I don't know and I've pointed out the dumbness of this policy and it's fallen on deaf ears)  as I fill up the containers (again complained that after the restaurant is open it should be their job to keep it stocked... Deaf ears) She tells her that she wants a comment card

Pai: yeah if you want to leave a review. *parent company* will email you and you can fill out your comment or complaint 

Cw: no I would just feel better if I can talk to a manager.

Pai: *senses something happened during her stay. It couldn't be me. I only talked to her for like 2 minutes* ok, is there anything I can help with?

Cw: *insert the bugs bunny no*

Pai: *writes down the hotels number. As is protocol, there's an option to be sent to upper management. I tell her to have a good day*

5 minutes later:

*Riiiiinnnnng*

Pai: *property name* how can I help you?

Cw: yeah so I'm like 99% sure that I left my late husband's ring up in my room. He just died and we've been together for 31 years. It's on the nightstand. I'll be right back to pick it up.  I have a meeting I need to get to.

Pai: ok I'll be right back to go and look for you 

Cw: *peak Karen* and is there someone else I can talk to? Like a housekeeping manager or an actual manager because you have ruined my day. What with the coffee situation. You told me you would be right on it and when I came back there was still no coffee. You sound apathetic and cold. I don't know if your having a bad day or you're just tired but I feel like I'm being personally attacked by you. 

( Now at this point I've put in 40 hours in 3 days (becoming more and more common, last pay period I put in 100 hours. I don't know If I should be proud .)  Had to fix things that anyone else could of fixed (and fixing my own, taking initiative before it becomes a problem kind of thing) writing reports and looking all over creation for an iron.)  I'm tired and I didn't mean to sound rude or unfeeling. Especially since In the back of my mind I know that's can't be me but rather her grief of loosing her husband. But I don't care. She could of resolved this issue while she was here and I asked if everything was ok. How was I to know I was a problem. I just met this woman...

Pai: I'm sorry that you felt that way and it was not my intention to do so. My paperwork took longer then expected to complete. I will go up with a housekeeping manager to look for your ring. What is a good phone number to call if we have found it? 

Cw: *gives her number* and just so you know. This call is recorded and I'm sending it to your boss. Showing how rude you were to me

(In my head (and in my car after she and I were long gone)) 
So is this line. And I sincerely hope you don't need to come back for his funeral because I will not serve you. I will walk your ass to *slummy hotel down the way* I don't know you. Or your husband. If I'm the worst thing to happen to you today despite the face your husband died recently Al because of coffee. You either hated your husband or need your priorities straight. I have no interest in personally attacking you. I don't know you. But the small interactions we've had put a bad taste in my mouth. You don't want actual resolution. You wanna bitch and moan till we cabe into your demands of free room or points. Or whatever. 

(What I actually said)

Pai: I understand ma'am, I will call with an update. 

I go into this bitches room. Tear it apart looking for a ring she hasn't even described. Not that it needed much help looking torn apart. It was like wading in a landfill. I start to freak out. If she thinks I have it out for her over something as stupid as a cup of knockoff Folgers. Then she's probably going to think I stole this ring... The housekeeping manager calms me down and says he will have his team double check as they actually clean the room. I give him the number and go back to my post

When I get back my relief finally shows up. Half an hour late. He tells me that she called and found the ring. On her finger... I tell him about this crazy lady and everything that lead up to it. And he tells me. No hint of kidding in his face

""Well you need to sharpen up..."" 

This dude is the worst. I always have to fix his mistakes in opera. The man always messes up prepaids. Doesn't make keys despite being the morning shift. Complains if he has to even work a minute over his scheduled time. Will not come in for anyone (we only have a 4 man front desk staff. One of them isn't even a front desk agent. So him working his set 3 days screws us constantly.) He marks down the wrong times for wakeup calls. And never does the shuttle list correctly. You have to hold this guy's hand gingerly because he is incompetent and has the temper of a bull smacked with an iron skillet. And the worst part is. He is the oldest member on our team. So he thinks he's hot shit and delegates the work he's supposed to do into others. 

I couldn't say anything. I just felt my brain fry as I walk out. Didn't do trash. I didn't care enough. I'll probably do it tonight anyway. 

I thank you for reading this far. The rants in a weird way help the anger melt away. So yeah

Tldr: lady I've only spoken 2 sentences to thinks I have it our for her and when I vent to my laziest coworker he tells me I need to sharpen up.

Idk if it's just my approach or if I'm doing anything wrong. But do you guys have any advice to sblock the haters and not worry about what they say?",65,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CDB00DC0>
950,Why do people lie like this?,"I work a few nights a week at a hotel, night audit shift, it is not my main career but a side job to earn a little extra “fun money.”
The hotel that I work at is not really a family oriented place we get a lot of long haul truckers and people who are traveling for business. We do not have any of the amenities that families would want, like a pool or game rooms. We offer a room with a clean bed and private bathroom, that’s all you’re guaranteed. 

Lady comes in with her 3rd party reservation, it’s set for 2 adults in a 2 queen bed room. She’s got a couple little kids running between her and her van. I go over the reservation declaration, she confirms it’s correct, and I get her checked in and hand her the contract to sign. As she’s looking at it I’m telling her what the rules are: no smoking/vaping, no candles, no parties, no cooking or cooking appliances, no pets, no visitors during quiet hours, and no undeclared guests in the room. Any violations will result in immediate eviction without refund. 

The lady asks me what that means so I explain that in her case, she is allowed 2 adults in the room and if we see more people than that we will ask her to leave. She asks why we need to know the number of people, so I answer that we need to know so that if there is some kind of disaster we can give the authorities an accurate number of people to account for. 
So she goes “What about kids?” 
And I said “Well you don’t have any children declared on your reservation, so in the event of a disaster they would just be looking for two adults.” 

Eventually she hands me back the contract and says she has two kids.

I’m still baffled, kids don’t cost extra on the reservation so why wouldn’t she put them on there? Also, because her reservation was for two adults, if we had run out of double queen rooms we would have given her a free upgrade to a single king and sold that double to someone that did declare their kids!",30,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CDB00070>
951,Muy bien!,"I love this scam that I've had at multiple hotels now. It's always with a gentlemen who speaks Spanish, and as someone who comes from a family that is fluent in Spanish, I get to use these opportunities to practice mine. 

It goes like this, a man who works with corporate has a FedEx order that is arriving to the hotel for some fire safety inspection. He always asks me to write down a bunch of numbers and then repeat them back to him. However, this latest time I decided to pull a classic move and read the numbers back to him incorrectly to which our friendly scammer says, ""Ah muy bien!"" At this point, he always asks for my managers personal cell number and then I know I can safely hang up the phone.

Has anyone else had a call from these guys or are they just following me across state lines?",10,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CDB00250>
952,I’m just a manager. I’m not god.,"This is the story of a lady who has never lived in the real world. 
Our tale starts at Check in; she kicked off immediately by complaining that people were smoking a certain type of plant in the parking lot, this plant is legal in the state, and we/I really don’t care what people do in their own vehicles, as long as they’re far enough from the door that the smell isn’t in the lobby.  I get her processed as quickly as possible and send her off to her room, with all of the information she could need. 
Soon after she calls down to the desk to ask about our services; I give her the basic rundown of what is available, and tell her that the services menu is on the desk next to the phone with detailed information. I try to get her off the phone by asking if there is anything else that she needed, and her response left me speechless. “Fresh sheets and towels that have never been touched by human hands.” I laughed, thinking she was joking and offered fresh hot sheets and towels from the dryer. But she was not joking… she said she wanted them “still in the package.”
So I explained that hotel linens do not come packaged in sets like the ones you can get at a department store, but rather in large bundles of items directly from the manufacture & the bundles are usually 50 items per package, so it would be impossible for us to give her linens still in the package. 
She then huffed as if *I* was the stupid one and said “thanks for nothing.” 

So now I’m sitting here wondering what portal of hell this woman crawled out of, and what did I do to deserve this mistreatment.",88,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CDB002E0>
953,"""I'm the owner you're fired!""","All names are changed and this has been summarized since most of the call was a bunch of numbers.

Me ( **Aithne** ), Mr. Patel, Rose, Drew, and RO (real owner)

Hey all, I'm going to tell you about a ""Mr. Patel"" who attempted to fire me. To clarify my property is actually owned by 3 partners however 1 individual owns over 60% and is the main one to oversee any costs, hiring, maintenance, ect. The other 2 are there just monetarily.

At the start of my shift I receive a phone call:

M: Thank you for calling *My Hotel* in *City* this is Aithne, How can i help you. (check the number just to be cautious of local prank calls. It's and out of country number)

Mr.P: Yes this is Mr. Patel the regional supervisor. I need to speak with you about the Covid relief package that will be arriving tomorrow..

At that point I knew it was a scam. Since we had received our Covid relief package 3 weeks prior. I decided to play along since it was a slow night and I began texting my GM (Drew) and letting him know what was going on. Rose had noticed that I was amused and leading someone around in circles playing dumb on the phone writing down random numbers and repeating them several times so she called RO. After about 20 minutes I got bored and started a conference call with Drew and RO. Mr.P began to pretend he was speaking with Drew to give me permission to tell him how much cash was in the drawer and how much was on the property in general.

Mr.P: Yes, Drew we need your verification so Aithne can disclose the amount of cash on the property.

Drew: (finally speaking) No she does not have the authorization to do so.

Mr.P: Aithne! You are allowing a guest to impersonate Drew. Guess what stupid girl I'm the owner and you're fired. Collect your things and leave stupid a\*\* b\*\*\*\*. You better not be there when i get there in 15 mintues.

RO: Aithne, if you leave you are fired. Stay put my wife is bringing you some food. She will sit with you for the night. Drew go to bed. You are scheduled to come in early so ill work an hour into the shift for you so you can sleep and pay for it.

In all the RO was extremely angry and made sure I got the number. When he came into release me that morning his mom had made homemade sweets that he had given me.

The number ended in ""XB"" and I said, ""Huh, that's funny, I would have expected it to end in FU, as-in f**k you."" then I told him that our owner's name isn't Patel.

955,Crazier than normal unregistered guest attempting to get a key scenario ...,"I know everyone has been through this a lot where people get upset because surprise we don't just hand out keys to anyone who asks. This happened to me today and it was wilder than normal.

I young guy walks in at the start of my shift to get a new key and he'll be NoIDea.

NoIDea: My room key isn't working can I get a new one.

Me: Of course may I see your ID please?

NoIDea: I don't have one.

I glance at the reservation and its under a females name.

Me: Unfortunately sir the registered guest will need to come in in person with an ID before I can release any keys for that room.

NoIDea: But I'm staying in the room my mom rented it for me. 

I explain the key/ID policy to him.

NoIDea: *looks flabbergasted* I had no idea so, what am I supposed to do?

I tell him he can wait for a bit in the lobby if his mother won't be that long. Instead he left and sat by his door with his girlfriend and since weren't that busy yet I figured I'd let them sit out for there a bit and see what happens.

As expected the phone rings a few minutes later and its Fronting Mom.

Fronting Mom: I'm calling so you can give my son a key hes staying in room 135. 

I explain to her the policy and she says she's out of town and I apologize and repeat the policy. She asked why if she is calling herself I still cant give her son a key and I tell her I can't verify her identity over the phone and out safety policy prohibits me from handing out keys to unregistered people. We went in circles a few times until quiet unexpectedly she screamed Mrs. Crabtree style

FM: I SAID GIVE MY SON A KEY NOW!!!!!

Me: OK Ma'am I've explained the policy to you several times. If you continue with this attitude I will have your son escorted off by PD and evict you from the room as well.

FM: Oh bullshit you can't do that.

Me: I do not want to but I will if I need to. You son is welcome to wait here in the lobby until

\*click\*

OK so that didn't go very well and I look at the cameras and her son is still sitting by the room. I'll give them another 20 minutes or so and see what happens. About 10 minutes later they got up and left the property.

About an hour later I see the 2 teenagers walking in with a very stern looking woman I assumed to be the mom and a group of older adults as well. The stern woman turns out is an aunt so she will be FireAunt as she does the majority of the talking and the others adults who just chime in here and there are Backup Relatives.

FireAunt: Why did these keys (shows me room keys) stop working?

Me: Excuse me?

FA: Why were these keys disabled? They aren't due for checkout until tomorrow if they hadn't been deactivated we wouldn't be having this issue. That's on you I don't know why you are punishing them for it. 

Me: Ma'am I'm not punishing anyone

Backup Relatives: Yeah you are they can't get in their room.

Me: Excuse me, no one is being punished I am following our safety policy. I cannot and will not hand out keys to unregistered people.

Several of the adults begin filming me which makes me nervous ... about how my hair looks.

FA: Well then we need a refund for our entire stay since you won't let them back in their room.

They've been here for 3 days with checkout tomorrow.

Me: OK may I see your ID please.

FA: Why? 

Me: I need to verify your identity before I can discuss guest details with you.

FA: I'm their aunt my sister sent me here to get their keys for them. She called to give permission for you to give them keys so why are you refusing to do so?

Me: In that case I can speak to your sister when she gets here with proper ID as I can discuss guest details with the registered guest only and I cannot verify identity over the phone as was explained to her.

FA: Why are you talking to me then? You violated your own policy thats on you.

BR: *snarky laughter*

I don't know how to answer that so I just stare at her with a neutral gaze.

FA: I know you disabled their keys with RFID technology or something. I used to work at several hotels I know that keys just don't deactivate themselves. 

I tried not to laugh and keep my neutral gaze and nearly failed. 

Me: Actually ma'am our key cards use a magnetic strip there is no RFID technology involved. Keys get deactivated for various reasons most of which are beyond our control. 

FA: Why didn't you tell them that when they checked in? You didn't explain that thats on you not them.

Me: Uh, I don't understand your question ma'am. Its not our policy to explain every possible scenario concerning key cards at check-in.

FA: You deactivated their cards so they couldn't get back in why? 

Me: I did not ma'am. I never met these guests until today so I had no reason to let alone the means to do so. If there isn't anything else I can help you with you'll need to leave the lobby.

They kept talking but I went about my business ignoring them then they finally started to leave. I had other things to do so I headed out of the office as well. As I left Fire Aunt tried to engage me one more time. 

FA: I need your manager.

Me: Come back after 7am tomorrow.

FA: I need to talk to your manager now.

Me: You can if you come back after 7am tomorrow.

FA: What is your managers #?

Me: I'm not giving you that per policy. You're not the registered guest nor a guest at all so you have no basis to speak to my manager about your sisters reservation. Please leave the property.

FA: Says who?

Me: I do. 

FA: You're not the manager.

Me: I am not but that won't stop me from calling PD and having you and the rest of your party trespassed from our property for harassment. All of you need to leave now including the two teenagers. If any of you come back onto the property before the registered guest gets here I will call PD.

They finally left and I told my manager about it and they're DNRd. If the registered guest doesn't come in and the teenagers try to get their stuff too bad only the registered guest can pick things up. I expect A-shift to get an earful on that.",130,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CDB003A0>
956,"What a pleasant man, so sad he won't be staying with us this evening.","Attempted check in went like this:

Before I could hit submit on this post, their daughter called me trying to raise hell because how absolute dare I refuse to charge a card that is in the reservation but not present at the hotel and could belong to literally anyone. I pointed out that using that card was not a secure transaction and not safe for the hotel or guests if we accepted cards that way.

957,My Scammer Story (Sadly not Mr. Patel),"Hm. Looks like i have to use the markdown editor for this one, lets see how it goes.


TL DR: Always count your change.



So, a few months ago I had someone come to the reception asking to buy a candy bar. He proceeded to pay with a 100€ bill. This and the fact that he was asking me questions about the hotel, my job etc. non-stop piqued my interest. I smelled a scam incoming.

So I did not put his 100€ bill in the register, but on the desk next to my keyboard until the transaction was complete. He kept talking and talking and talking, and, suddenly, found a 2 euro coin in his pocket to pay for the candy bar and asked for his 100€ bill back. 

Now, if you are not familiar, this is how this trick works. The Scammer distracts you with never-ending small-talk and questions while you give them change, then providing a smaller amount of currency , taking the change you already gave them AND the large bill they provided in the beginning. It sounds stupid, but it has worked on multiple colleagues around town before, but only if you have never heard of it or are completely oblivious.


Now this guy was a bit more daring than the others, he had already pocketed the change I gave him and then demanded his money back. I declined. He got angry and started yelling at me, demanding his money. I pointed out that I was aware of him trying to scam me and proceeded to call the police.


He turned around instantly and ran out of the door. Or tried to. Because I had locked those from my desk. So he ran face first into the glass door. I then opened the door because I wanted to avoid property damage and he ran away cursing and screaming.

Police showed up a few minutes later, I gave them a description and they left. We got asked for video evidence two months later, so I assume they caught him doing something similar stupid at another property or shop.

The funniest part about all of this ? 

While he was busy chatting to me to keep me distracted, I only gave him change for 50€ not 100€ .",58,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CDB00E50>
958,"We still aren't sold out, but we still don't have anything...","Word for the day: Sisyphean. Endlessly performing a gruelling task over and over, with no progress made.

Tonight gentle readers, we shall speak of those unwilling - nay *unable*- to accept the idea that we have nothing available. Not the first such tale, and actually almost identical to the other one, located here: 
https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheFrontDesk/comments/pcjzwo/we_arent_sold_out_but_we_dont_have_anything/

For those wondering how things have been, there's been some developments. It seems that we still get to host about a half dozen of the local homeless, so we're not empty anymore. Joanne is back, having broken her hip and unable to climb stairs, so I get to hear her shouting at the bushes again. Still, she's healing well, and is already out of the chair and in a walker. Buttercup is in the usual spot by the coffee, if anyone needs a little unicorn time.

Anyways, as regards tonight's Tale, I was relaxing on the last bit of my shift. Things had been mostly pleasant, though I had to be a bad guy and roust someone out of the stairwell and into the driving rain. I don't like doing that.

A moving truck pulls into the portico. I sigh, ready to disappoint someone. The someone is a woman, no mask, looking somewhat perplexed.

""Are you guys empty?""

""We're doing renovations. Sorry, we don't have anything available.""

""What about for tomorrow?

""I'm sorry, but we won't have anything available then either. Your best bet is probably the Holy Crap down the street.""

""But you do have some cars outside.""

""We have a handful of rooms, but they're already occupied.""

""That's okay, just give me a room tomorrow when they check out.""

""None of them will be available until the end of the month. Probably later.""

""Okay then, make me a reservation for then.""

""Three weeks from now..? I'm sorry but I can't do that. We don't know for certain if the room will be available even by then."" Sadly, this is true. The county is taking a LOT longer on repairs than anticipated.

""That's okay, just go ahead and make it.""

Something seems 'off' about her demeanor. She's not being a strident 'Karen' or anything, and I can't tell if she's trying to catch me in a lie or what. 

""No, you don't understand, I *cannot* make a reservation. The rooms are blocked out, and will not be made available until repairs are finished.""

""How about if I book online?""

""You won't be able to, the entire inventory is locked.""

""Go ahead and make it for whenever they're available then.""

Pinching the bridge of my nose, ""We do not *know* when the rooms will be available, and until then, we *cannot* make any reservations for them. There *might* be some availability at the end of the month, but I-""

""So you are telling me you don't have anything at all, *ever*?""

""Yes, that is exactly what I am saying. We have nothing.""

""I'll come back later today and check what you have available.""

""We won't have anything available. Please, the Holy Crap is just down the street, I'm sure that will be fine.""

""No, I want to stay here. I'll be back to talk to someone else.""

""They'll tell you the same thing.""

""Then I'll call your corporate manager and tell them to make a reservation.""

And with that futilimatum, she leaves.

\*sigh*

*Why* don't people believe us when we say we don't have anything available? Do they think we're lying? That we don't want to make money? Maybe we're just too stupid to work the blinky computer box and can't do our jobs properly and... 

Okay, if you need me I'm going to be in Buttercup's paddock for a bit, because I have zero faith in humanity anymore. Argh.

959,Is your reception shift as busy as mine?,"I work front desk reception at arguably one of the busiest Hotels in my city. Our desk has 3 computers along with a fourth Manager's front desk PC.

Check in time is 4pm and I exclusively work the late shift 2:30pm to 11pm - meaning I catch all the arrivals for the day along with one fellow coworker.

As a new receptionist at the start of summer we would average 70 room arrivals daily.

Now that COVID-19 restrictions have eased up quite drastically we are almost back at full running capacity and are averaging 120 room arrivals - meaning in best case scenario my coworker and I would check in 60 rooms each on average per shift. 

The purpose of this post was to contrast how busy my shifts were compared to other receptionists. 

Keep in mind the other tasks a receptionist has - answering the phones, booking taxis, guest requests/queries, collecting luggage... 

On top of the tedious check-in process where u have to take payment, cut keys, allocate appropriate rooms, the occasional OTA screw up where the reservation doesn't show up on the system... I could go on for an eternity. 

Am I being overworked or is this typical? This is the first Hotel I've worked at so I have no frame of reference.",8,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CDB00370>
960,What are y'all wearing?,"Sorry in advance if this the wrong place for this but I'm in way over my head.

I'm starting a new front desk job in a couple days and have absolutely no clue what I'm supposed to be wearing. I am 100% clothing illiterate, I've bought like two items of clothing in my life and they were both for these interviews. I've worn the same shirt/sweater/McDonalds worker pant combo to every interview but I don't think I can just wear a variation of that to work every day. We're in a somewhat rural part of the US so its not like I should be wearing a suit or blazer like I've seen in New York City. Seriously thanks if you can help me at all. Oh and I'm a guy.

Edit: Y'all are seriously some of the most informative, supportive, and kind people that could ever exist on the internet. It's no wonder so many of y'all work in hospitality! To say these responses have blown me away would still be a massive understatement. This was better than anything I could have hoped for. 
I've got a shopping list a mile long with some essentials (button-ups, shoes, pants) at the top, along with some things I'll add in after a paycheck or two. Not to mention several pages of amazing tips from all you wonderful folks.

961,My coworker was scammed out of over $1000.,"My coworker (who is notorious for adding a little something something into her beverages while on the job) was covering the night audit shift. 

When I arrived for my 7am shift, she had been on hold for almost two hours (???). She told me not to hang up because she was on the phone with who she thought was the owner of the hotel. They exchange funny banter whenever he visits, so she says when she got a call from him at 5am asking for a favor, she hopped right on it. 

She was tasked with sending over $1000 through western union for a fire department inspection (on a Sunday?) and they needed payment before they came to the hotel. She was also offered a bonus, so she sent the money immediately, with hopes to get it back, and then some. 

When the GM and I arrived, she requested the reimbursement before she clocked out. When she explained the situation to him, he’s also extremely confused and informed her that we do not pay for inspections and she’s most likely being scammed. She panics immediately, calls her bank, and stays in the back office for over an hour. 

I literally cannot believe that she did this— I couldn’t even feel bad. Why would you come out of pocket for something work-related?? She should’ve called the GM immediately or took a message. I’m pretty positive she was wasted because I could smell the alcohol seeping through her pores. At 7am.",184,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CDB00B20>
962,Super Shinny Status,"I’ve read on this forum about the entitlement of Super Shinny Members trying to throw their weight around, but never experienced it in ‘real’ life. Guy comes in and declares himself the superset, shiniest, member of them all. And as such he doesn’t have to put down a deposit, if he pays cash. 
Now he assured me he’s been super shiny for the last 20 years and stays in our chain 200 days a year. How could I possibly not believe him. I had to explain that despite his shiny butthole everyone who wants to pay cash has to leave a deposit.  Then he played his ‘ace’ in the sleeve, ‘I want you to call the manager.’ He was absolutely shocked that my answer was ‘no’. 
Sorry Mr. shiny butthole my manager pays me money to not bother him. He then mentions how he doesn’t want me to get fired. That’s okay Mr. Shiny, I can live with the consequences of my actions. I’m absolutely fine with collecting unemployment, and my cat could always use more cuddle time.

963,Ha! Welcome to my world and enjoy your karma.,"This past weekend there were FOUR sports teams booked. Hockey. Yes, hockey: the word which sends a shiver up the spine of every Front Desk worker.

I didn't experience the following personally because I have weekends off but I lived it vicariously from the comfort of my couch via emails.

While the FD staff is generally expected to handle these groups on their own (one FDA per shift), apparently the sheer volume of impending disasters caused management to call in reinforcements in the persons of the FOM and the Director of Sales (the latter, I should mention, being the one who booked this cluster of a f**k in the first place) until 1am.

Friday and Saturday nights proceeded as expected. Well, as I expected, anyway. 

I should also mention that every guest from every team signs a ""Team Code of Conduct"" document at check-in which outlines the hotel's expectations (like, you know, don't disturb other guests, don't play pick-up games in the hallways, parents accompany their kids everywhere, etc.). This has always been the ""go-to"" for management, because of course after the parents sign it they will have no choice but to be the model hotel guest. 

A few excerpts from the emails:

""Rm xxx noise complaint at 12:40a 'Did you know they are having a party by the elevator'""

""A group of boys was outside around 1130AM. No parent in sight. They took a bunch of the orange poles [Markers for the snowplow. Winter is coming.] out of the ground and started sword fighting and chucking them at each other. I went outside to admonish them and they all ran around the back of the building.""

""Room xxx complained about yyy kicking a ball against the wall all day. Also kids running up and down the hallways screaming since 8 am. There was nowhere for me to put her that was away from the team. Her husband is here for the [totally unrelated but also booked for the same weekend] conference. I have also heard the constant pounding on the ceiling from kids running all day.""

""[Airline crew] member in xxx complained about kids knocking on her door and yelling at 10AM. She said when she confronted them, they just back talked back to her telling her it wasn't quiet time.""

And, of course, the driving force behind all the other issues: ""There's been parents drinking in the lobby since 11 AM, just watch out for them."" [Bar doesn't even open until evening.] 

Then, from the FOM themselves:  ""Many, many, many noise complaints again tonight. [DoS] and I patrolled hallways as best as we could. Noise thankfully settled down in the hallways around 11pm after speaking with them a thousand times.""

FOM and DoS also drafted the shuttle driver into the fray so there were THREE of them doing what had always been the responsibility of ONE solitary FDA/NA.

FOM called Saturday the worst shift they ever worked. And according to the breakfast worker this morning who witnessed a small portion of the debacle, DoS was clearly out of their element.

Good. Maybe they'll think twice before booking another sports team.",20,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CDB006A0>
964,Sometimes guest interactions leave me feeling degraded.,"I work front desk. It’s not often at all i feel this way. 

A regular guest comes to the desk with used towels in his hands. He’s saying something but talking so fast and softly idk what it is, but i have an idea. He needs new towels. 

Me: you need new towels?

Man: yes! We don’t have any!

I know he wants me to take his dirty towels with my bare hands but i’m not about to. 

Man: two sets!

I go into the back and see him start following me. I don’t care how angry you are, do not follow me into a place that is clearly for staff only. 

Me: sir please step back. 

Wtf. He just stares at me blankly. I get the towels and come back and set them on the counter. 

Me: used towels can be left outside of your room. 

He still is just staring, so i decide to be nice and give him a bag to put them in. I hold it open and he puts them in. I hand it to him. He holds it out to me again. I’m not taking your dirty towels. 

Me: towels can be left outside of your room if you don’t want them. 

He tosses the bag onto the floor behind the desk. Unbelievable. 

Me: sir, for future reference, if you have dirty towels you don’t want, they are to be left outside of your room. We don’t collect them here. Ok?

He gives me a dirty look and leaves without saying anything. I am pissed. The engineer turns the corner immediately after and without skipping a beat says, “oh shit, don’t piss sweetladypropane off!”

I wear a button down and slacks. Why the fuck would i take dirty towels, first of all. Second of all, that is just so blatantly rude.

965,"You just want to kick us out because we're black!! Umm, I haven't even seen you.","A little back story for context first. Before the pandemic began, we had security at our hotel on Friday and Saturday nights, and while we rarely needed it, it was nice to have if something did occur. When the pandemic hit and business slowed down to next to nothing and cuts needed to be made, security was one of the first things to go. We were told that when things picked up again, we would have security on the weekends again. Well, despite business almost returning to normal, it never happened. Now, if there's a problem, the FDAs have to handle it, even at night....BUT, management **does not** want us to go to the room door and knock (never know what kind of crazy may be on the other side); we're to handle everything over the phone. This plays an important part of the story. So, now on to the details...

Cast of characters: Night Auditor (NA)=me. Pissed off guest=POG. Loud obnoxious guest=LOG.

Time: Saturday night, 10:30pm. Phone rings from an in-house call....

NA: good evening, FD, this is OP, how may I help you?

POG: could you please do something about the azzhat family across the hall? It's f'ing 10:30 and some of us are trying to sleep.

NA: Sure. I see you're in room 4xx. I'll come up and see what room is loud and give them a call.

POG: thank you.

I go up to the 4th floor and find out that the loud room is right across the hall, just as POG had said. I took my cordless phone with me so I could call them from a few doors down the hallway from their room...

NA: hi, this is OP from the front desk. I've gotten a complaint about the loud music coming from your room. Since quiet hours began at 10:00pm, I have to ask you to please turn your music down (now I should mention that when their phone started ringing, the music stopped).

LOG: we're not playing any music. do you hear any loud music in the background?

NA: No, not now, but I'm out in the hallway and right before you answered your phone, you shut the music off.

LOG: no, you're mistaken, we're not playing any music.

NA: well, I know what I heard, and once again, I need you to keep the volume down so as to not bother other guests.

LOG: yeah, yeah, whatever.

I stand out in the hallway for a few minutes to see if the music is turned back on, but hear nothing so I return to the front desk. About three hours pass, when I get another call from POG..

NA: front desk, how may I help you?

POG: this is room 4xx. It was quiet for a while, but they're at it again, louder than last time.

NA: Okay, I'll be right up.

I get off the elevator and can hear the music clear down the hall. As loud as it was, I was surprised no one else complained. I call the room, once again from my cordless, and just like last time, the music shuts off when the phone starts ringing.

NA: hi, this is OP from the FD again. I've gotten another complaint about your music and I need you to turn it down please.

LOG: man, why are you bothering us? We ain't got no loud music playing.

NA: once again, I'm out in the hallway and I heard it as soon as I got off the elevator.

LOG: Ain't us man. Quit bothering us.

NA: Well, just to let you know, if I receive any more complaints, you will be asked to leave the hotel.

LOG: and if we don't wanna go?

NA: then the police will be called to escort you out.

LOG: man, you just want to kick us out because we're black.

NA: no, it's because you're disturbing other guests. Besides, I haven't even seen you, so I don't know what color you are.

LOG: you're judging us by our music.

NA: i thought you said you weren't playing any music.

CLICK

Didn't get any more complaints and the couple of times I walked past the room later in the night/morning, there wasn't a peep to be heard. They knew they had given themselves away with their 'judging us by our music' comment.

Found out when I went into work last night that the room had been trashed and they had been charged a $500 'deep cleaning' fee and put on the Do Not Rent list.",96,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CDB00B80>
966,"Not a joke, just how my night went","Florida man walks into the hotel lobby, goes to check-in and runs into Mr. Moneybags. Mr. Moneybags and Florida man start talking. Florida man begins to repeat himself and admits quite a few times that he's coming off of some heavy LSD. 

Mr. Moneybags seems unfazed but tries to end the conversation quickly. Florida man starts in with some micro-aggressive racist comments about the comedian he just went to see. Mr. Moneybags is the comedian's agent and of the same race as the comedian. Florida man doesn't realize he's insulting and angering the 6'2, bodybuilder large man in front of him. 

Mr. Moneybags composes himself, ends the conversation polietely and leaves for his room. Florida man tries to turn and talk to me, the supervisor who just wants this man to leave already. He then asks for a late checkout, I agree thinking he'll oversleep anyways. 

He then turns to leave and says ""If I'm not out by then, call the coroner!"" ...Sir, as late as it is, as messed up on stuff as you are, please don't joke like that. That's so messed up.

This guy said he came to the desk the first morning of his stay and asked the woman if they had oatmeal on the Buffet. Now our buffet foods change at times. The chef is also having a hard time getting certain things in from vendors. So we don't know right off the bat if something will be on the Buffet. The front desk girl tells him she is not sure but he can go over and look or ask the hostess. He got pissed and wrote how she was an anglo white woman so there is no language barrier. 

Then he says that he tells the person at the front desk that night to charge him for 2 dasanis. He states that she looked like she didn't know what he was talking about. And that he had to say Dasani like the water. That if he said airheads would she be more aware.

I know the second one was about me. It wasn't that I didn't understand him. It was the fact that the lobby was busy and the noise was too loud. I couldn't hear him at all.

968,Night shifts in the 4th most dangerous city in Canada,"If you google a list of the most dangerous cities in Canada, the city I live and work in is the 4th most dangerous city in Canada with a CSI of 270. I work from the night shift from 11pm to 7am. I am 32F, 120lbs soaking wet, and I'm a whopping 4'11"", not even 5ft tall. I'm a night owl and don't mine making money when I'd be laying in bed awake otherwise. But I am constantly terrified. If for one second I start feeling safe something will happen. In June, the pub was robbed. In July, the pub was robbed. In August, the pub was robbed. Every time it happens its when the office personnel go into the pub to get the money ready for the day, and that happens between 5 and 6 am, before night shift is done. Everytime they break in they use a crowbar to pry open one door or another, then use it as a weapon to get the money. Last time it happened they could only get into the kitchen (back of house) but they couldn't get into the locked pub. If they were so inclined they could've easily come to the front desk and attacked me. Cops? We don't have city police, we rely on the RCMP, which are federally provided. In all honesty, they're kinda slacking. I've actually almost been hit by RCMP vehicles multiple times while legally crossing in a crosswalk. They are not the greatest. Anyways, we have 2 panic buttons, one at the front desk and one in the pub. A coworker was being assaulted once and pressed the panic button. The RCMP casually sauntered in half an hour later, didn't ask if everything was OK, just asked my coworker ""so why'd you press the panic button, that's for emergencies only."" As if he didn't take his time getting there. Despite all of this, the front desk staff are responsible for the security of the hotel. We have to patrol the hallways and make sure no one dangerous is in the hotel. Because if someone dangerous attacks me or a guest my little tiny 120 lb ass is really gunna be able to defend us, pfft yeah OK. And everyone pretends like we're totally safe, like we don't live in the 4th most dangerous city in the country. Oh, and on top of it, we're not allowed to leave the desk. Left the desk one evening to do a security check and the GM literally looked for me to tell me the phone was ringing and I wasn't supposed to leave the desk, when I tried telling him what I was doing he shushed me and told me to just go back to my desk and do my job. Told my FD manager and she didn't believe me. I  make minimum wage, I don't get a night premium. So I do the best half-ass job possible. Before the pub closes, and I'm all alone, I will lock up the building, and secure it to the best of my availability. After the pub closes I only leave my desk to get breakfast ready. I will not walk around the hotel where I could potentially be attacked, all alone with no one to help me. Knowing the management here I'd probably get into trouble somehow, someway. And they're so ""concerned"" about security, the other night auditor got written up for going into the foyer doors to cool down. Because that's totally why we were robbed 3 months in a row. 

I think being in the city we are in should justify having a security officer in the wee hours, but that costs too much for the rich butt head that owns the place.

969,Guest goes on a 20 minute rant and almost makes me cry,"Disclaimer: this is extremely abridged because this phone call went on for at least 20 minutes and I was incredibly shaken up by it. There was plenty more that he said (all of it very similar) that I've cut out for length and my own sanity.

I was having a pretty standard NA shift, if a little boring until 4am. I got a call that opened up with a man screaming ""WAS I SUPPOSED TO BE WOKEN UP THIS EARLY??"". I was obviously a bit taken aback by this and all I could really muster was an ""I'm sorry?"". Immediately, still screaming ""I SAID WAS I SUPPOSED TO BE WOKEN UP THIS EARLY??"". I didn't even get a chance to say something before he repeated himself again, all in the same volume. This wasn't even a minute into the call yet and I was already extremely flustered.

Some semi-important background before I continue. I won't go into detail, but I have a lot of trauma associated with men, specifically men yelling and raising their voices in general. I had a lot of bad experiences in my childhood involving my stepfather and my mother's various boyfriends. Suffice to say I kind of shut down in situations when a man is getting particularly aggressive with me.

Anyways, at this point I was already trembling, but was trying not to let it get to me or show in my voice. So I asked him politely to please calm down and stop yelling. He did (after multiple times asking mind you) and asked again ""was I supposed to be woken up this early?"". I had no idea what he meant so I asked. He said he got a wake up call that he didn't set that woke him up. I apologized for the call and for disturbing his sleep. He asked if this was standard practice at our hotel to ""wake people up on the middle of the night for no reason"". I told him no, we only set wake up calls for guests who specifically ask. He asks why he was called then. I apologize again and tell him someone must have mistakenly set a wake up call for his room. He proceeds to go on a tirade about how ridiculous that is and that I should know better and know what I'm doing. 

About 10 minutes into the phone call, after he's reiterated the same points I listed before over and over and over again, we finally get some new material. At this point my hands are shaking pretty bad, my heart is pounding in my chest and my voice is audibly shaky. I'm full panic mode, but doing my best not to start crying on this call. He starts (very obviously ingenuinely) apologizing for ""bothering me"" and ""making me soo upset"". I honestly don't know how to respond to that so I don't. He then starts up about how the hotel needs to take responsibility for waking him up and ruining his vacation. He had previously asked for a late check out when he checked in and stated that, saying that ""it should've been pretty obvious he didn't want to be disturbed"". Then I hear it, the dreaded ""I want to speak to a manager"". 

I tried to tell him I would pass his information along to my manager, but he cut me off and started spouting something about it ""not being appropriate""? Cue this happening at least 4 or 5 more times before I could actually finish my statement. He made it very obvious that he wanted to talk to my GM and he wanted to talk to her NOW. I kept reiterating that I would pass his info to her, but he wasn't having that. Then he goes on a side tangent about how we didn't give him any pen or paper in his room and I make a point to tell him I can't give him my manager's information. I would be giving HIS information to HER, not the other way around. That must of especially pissed him off because he started raising his voice again and going over the same points he'd been reiterating the entirety of the phone call.

Finally as we're nearing the end of this horrible saga, he asks for my name multiple times, I guess trying to scare me? Make me think he was going to make a complaint about me or something. I must not have had the reaction to that he was hoping for because he got angrier, told me it was my fault for ruining his vacation, he was never going to stay here again, etc. All the standard Karen closing statements. He asked for my name a few more times, gave me another ""apology"" about ""bothering me"", told me I was ""great at apologizing"" and told me to ""have a great morning"" before hanging up.

That was hands down the worst interaction I have ever had working at this hotel and in customer service in general.

Before anyone asks, I didn't hang up because 1. I was worried it would piss him off even more and that would mean more grief on my end.  2. He would come to the desk and scream at me in person. And 3. I was honestly shell shocked and didn't think about it a whole lot.",69,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CDB00E20>
970,"It's 3:24 am, and this was a new one for me","Had a guy who looks homeless come to the door.  I spoke with him using the intercom.  This is the recounting of our conversation.  

*Useful acronyms*: **FG**(Flannel Guy, a seemingly homeless guy in mismatched flannel), **NA**(the villainous night auditor, surly and annoyed at working on ""fall back"" day), **MLM**(the MLM that sells the vitamins).

**NA**: How can I assist you?

**FG**: Do you have any rooms?

**NA**: Sorry, we're sold out.

**FG**: What about tomorrow?

**NA**: We do have rooms available.  They're running a mere $185, since Sundays are slower than the rest of the week.

**FG**: What about the corporate rate?

**NA**:  Depends on the company.  What company are you traveling with?

**FG**:  <Garbled>

**NA**, bluffing: Sorry, I don't think we have a rate with them.

**FG**:  Can I come inside so we can figure the rate out?

**NA**: Sorry, but I'm not allowed to let in anyone without a current reservation between Midnight and 7am.

**FG**: <Begins to speak, drowned out by the sudden sound of luggage wheels>

<NA begins cursing internally as guests walk out the door, opening it.  FG seizes on the opportunity and walks in.  Because of course he does.>

**FG**: So, about that corporate rate, could you double check?

**NA**, sighing internally:  Sure.  What was the company again?

**FG**: Joe's Carpeting and Interiors(Not actually what he said, but in case he said a real business, I went with a slightly more generic name.  The Carpeting and Interiors part is accurate, though)

**FG**, as NA looks for corporate code:  Man, I tell you, it's cold out there.  I've been walking all over town, and no one has rooms.  Not <lists three hotels within a mile of NA's property>.

**NA**, after checking: No sir, nothing like that for corporate codes.

**FG**:  Well, let's add it!

<NA resists urge to yell at FG that it doesn't effing work that way.>

**NA**: Sorry sir, but I'm not able to do that.  You'll need to talk to our director of sales.  Who is obviously not here at 3 in the morning.  Here's her card.

**FG**: So, will she be in tomorrow?

**NA**: Almost certainly not on a Sunday.  Probably be here on Monday.

**FG**:  Oh.  Well, can I stay in here a bit to warm up?

**NA**:  Nope.  I may already get in trouble for not preventing you from walking in the door during the locked hours.

**FG**:  Well, do you smoke?

**NA**:  I do not.

<And then it starts to get a little weird.>

**FG**: Good for you.  You're healthy like those guys I partied with in LA.  I was there with my sister for an (MLM) convention.  We were put up in a (my hotel chain), top floor.  Everyone was having a blast.  No drugs or alcohol.  It was an all-natural high.  Such a great time.  Anyway, when is check in tomorrow?

**NA**: 3pm.

**FG**: Cool.  Say, you've heard of MLM right?

**NA**, cautiously:  Yes...

**FG**: I'd love to talk to you about a business opportunity.

**NA**, internally:  Did this motherf\*\*ker just come in here at 3 something to try to get me involved with MLM?  What the actual f\*\*k?

**NA**, dropping all pretense:  Not interested.

**FG**, indignant: Well, I guess you don't want to be healthy, fatass.

<FG proceeds to go outside and sift through the ash tray for an only partially consumed cigarette, then leaves.>

<NA realizes only after he left that he really wishes he'd called the cops.  That guy surely would have talked himself into a tasing.>

There was a little more to the convo, like him asking if we had a jacuzzi or a sauna, which we don't.  But I cut that because his little game of twenty questions in our vestibule would have double the length of this post and wasn't really relevant.

But seriously, what the hell?  I mean, I've had a lot of people try to talk me into their silly MLMs before, but never a homeless looking guy at 3 in the morning.",21,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CDB00A90>

972,Sneeky pool boi,"Hello Friends and Front desk! Your friendly local Night Auditor here, typing from work on a computer a century old! Got a fresh story for ya.  
This happened about 3 days ago. I came in for my audit shift and it's been pretty quiet since we hit the holiday season. I had just finished getting some paperwork done against the clock because nature was calling.   


I go to stand up and the door opens, a young man arrives, the door was locked so I knew he was a guest- so I patiently wait for him to walk by the desk and go to his room before I lock everything up.  
On the way he does some weird things, first- he walks over to the pool, looks at the sign and then ties the door, it's locked- but his key opens it. He seems pleased with himself and then peers down the hall at the front desk, where I'm putting the papers away, I clearly see him. Make eye contact even. I already know what he's going to do.

  
Me: \*Mumbles\* ""Please don't make my night harder.""  
he gets pumped and goes to his room on the other side of the hall from the pool, of course he is. I finish locking up my desk, take the keys and begin the long treck down the hallway to the break room to destroy the employee toilet, why not the customer toilet? ...Ew, Gross.  


And as I'm approaching the door to the laundry room and break room, opening the door and peering around the corner in blatant white swim trunks is Mr.Boi, Blonde, white, in shape. Probably in his late teens, early twenties. My immediate reaction was 'dude-bro', but I didn't say it.   
I stop, stare at him for a good ten seconds as he desperately tries to hide back in his room, keeping his head down, as if because he couldn't see me I couldn't see him. I just sighed as his door closed and made my way into the back, hoping to do my business peacefully.   
Funny thing about the staff bathroom, is it's adjacent to the guest bathroom in his room, and as such- the closing of his heavy door is very audible. I just shake my head and wrap up business before putting on the Auditor hoody and making sure my name tag is visible. I walk to the door, and in clean visible sight is mr.boi, lounging in the hot tub. I step in and begin the ritual.  


Me - me.  
Mb - mr.boi  
Me: ""Well, you already know the pool is closed, so I won't even begin to lecture you.""  
He feigned being unable to hear me, despite my baritone voice echoing off the glass walls like I was belting Figaro  
MB: ""Hm?"" \*Leans to the side of the hot tub\*  
Me: \*Done with this, I step up, get down and remove my branded mask.\* ""If you're not out of the hot tub and pool by 1:30am, (An hour. I was being nice) The chlorine will burn your skin and turn you into a smoothie.   
MB: \*Thumbs up\* 

At this point, he was knowingly breaking the rules, and I just didnt want to deal with him, so I left with the warning that the pool cleaning cycle would begin at that time (Despite it already having begun)   


Not even a sorry for breaking the rules? I almost wanted to kick them out and DNR them.   
So here's my question for the day folks, and please- only those with experience help out here. 

Why do you think guests believe hotel rules are.. 'circumstantial?'",43,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CDB00D00>
973,Guests we assumed to be nefarious in someway turned out to be something completely different ...,"We've had these semi-regular guests who've been with us for 7 or 8 times within the last year that had staff wondering and guessing what they do. They're a large group of Romanians who rent 3 rooms every time and pay with singles and some 5's but nothing higher. Sometimes they rent for multiple nights and sometimes just for a night.

Tonight they rented for one night and again paid in singles. Once they rented 3 rooms for 3 nights and paid in singles and that was a pain to deal with. They are not American born but have US ID's from Illinois. I don't think the kids are US born either because the ones I've dealt with have heavy accents.

It's a group of 2 men, 3 females, and a van load of kids. It's always the one man checking in and he is pretty direct borderline rude. The first time I checked them in it kind of threw me off. But I realized he wasn't a Karen and wasn't being rude and that's just his personality. In fact I sort of appreciate the directness because he works with me if there's an issue.

I got a mobster vibe from them personally or drug dealers. Some staff thought they were sex/human traffickers or were in prostitution. I thought they could be in prostitution or maybe some illicit stripping or something like that considering all the singles.

When the two guys came in if there was a problem the main guy would explain the situation to me then say ""what you do for me?"" complete with hand gestures. I'd make a suggestion then they'd speak to each other in Romanian seemingly aggressively with even more hand gestures until they reach a consensus. Then we'd go back and forth in this manner until we reach a resolution. Even though it's a bit amped at times we've always reached a resolution. I figured if they are mobsters they understand the value of not bringing unwanted unnecessary attention upon their enterprise.

But in considering all the possibilities concerning their activities I always had a question mark about the kids. If they are engaging in illegal activities why have a boat load of kids with them which would seem to unnecessarily complicate their efforts. The kids never seemed in distress and were always happy, bouncy etc. They seemed troupe-like which ... is exactly what they are.

My boss came in after I checked them in and I told her they were back and she said ""the Russians with the kids?"". I said yes because I know what she meant and she told me she saw them earlier that day in front a strip mall and the kids were singing and playing violins and other instruments.. She watched them for a bit and she said people after people were dropping cash into their cash pot or whatever.

None of us even considered that lol. Maybe we're jaded and assumed the worst. Judging on the amount of cash they produce they must be pretty good and I'm seriously wondering if they do this full-time. Who knows but I never even thought they are a traveling troupe of performers.",157,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CDC9BA00>
974,How's the weather?,"Used to work as receptionist in a hotel that was two separate buildings, front desk area had big picture windows and we could see the entire second building.

We had a long-term resident who was generally a pain and expected us to be an unending source of in-depth information about everything from tourism, travel, local eateries, etc.

He could not be bothered to find out anything on his own and wanted us to tell him where to go, what to do, how to get there, where to eat, how much it cost... One perfect beautiful warm summer day with fluffy white clouds I see him exit the building and head straight for my desk, where he asked me about the weather. I looked at him and then leaned over to look past him and said ""It's a beautiful day""  which pissed him off, lol.

975,Perhaps the 2Pines is better for your financial needs....,"I had a guest come in tonight and want a room. I have only 2 rooms left, the Presidental, $639, and a Penthouse, $450, are the standard rates but it's 130am so I quote him the member price not cheat but significantly lower. He's not happy of course with those prices. He told me it's just him. I don't know why he tells me it won't change the price and those are the last 2 rooms I have literally.. He tells me the Two pines hotel is $151, and I tell him those are standard rooms, not the penthouse and presidental, like I told him before. 

He tells me he wants to make a call to his friends to see what they want to do, but wait I thought it was just you.... so he comes back and says he wants the cheaper room, which is the penthouse. I even knock off another $50, and he says, ""Well if you made it the 2 pines price would be better."" This is what I get for trying to help people. Then to add to his entitlement he wants to park in the loading zone all night. I tell him I can't allow that it's a fire zone and loading zone, he then wants to tell me that he just spent an exorbitant amount for the room. I'm sorry sir entitlement doesn't cover parking.

977,Hatepedia reservations and incidentals.,"Guy walks in at midnight friendlyish lil banter, get name confirm reservation.

Ask for ID and Debt or CC.

I get ID but then a spiel about how his card was accidentally charged once and he ""left"" it in city several hours away (Hint I saw it when you pulled out your ID).  I play along and also tell him we can accept a $100 cash security deposit as well.

He says he doesn't have any cash on him, so I ask you are traveling without any way to pay for ANYTHING?  I am sorry but I can't check you in without incidentals covered.

Next comes the threats then argument saying, ""yes you can check me in without a card"" so I fix what I say and I WILL not check you in without incidentals covered.

Next comes the demanding my name writing it down and threats about reporting me.  When that doesn't work cash magically appears with him saying just give me my keys.

I also explained to him exactly how prepaid 3rd party reservations work and the card on file that is only good for Room and tax is only good for room and tax and not a penny more.

&#x200B;

I am sure we have all been there, but where is the logic in threatening to report me for not checking you in without a cash security deposit or debt/CC?  That's like saying I am going to complain to your boss because you are doing your job!

978,Sometimes I wish I could override my GM because of stuff like today ...,"We have this group of young people who have been here for about 4 days or so and were DNRd by my GM yesterday because they kept paying late, noise issues, chain smoking in front of other guests HVAC units--the normal stuff for 20 somethings. I got on today and was puzzled to see they extended their stay for a week.

The new-hire NA guy fully ignored, or didn't know what he was doing, the DNR and accepted their payment. He was trained by our normal auditor who isn't exactly the talkative type. I asked what we should do and I was told the GM said to let them stay in there for the week and they're still DNRd so no more extensions. The new guys coming in tonight so I'm tasked with explaining DNRs to him.

So around 9:30 pm I'm walking the property on an unrelated issue when I hear a strange noise. I get closer and it sounds like an animal grunting. I'm still puzzled by what it is when it suddenly screams/squeals and scares the crap out of me. It sounded like a pig so I knock on their door (its the 20 somethings) and they open looking perturbed that they're being bothered. It was a pig and it was grunting and trotting around. 

I told them we do not allow pigs and I asked if they cleared it with the FDA/GM and they said yes. I don't believe them because while it hasn't been stated explicitly (I've never had a pig in a room) I'm fairly certain we don't take farm animals in rooms. I called the MOD who checked them in to ask if they cleared a pig with her and she was like WTF no which I figured.

I called my GM and she was pissed. I ask if she wanted me to get them out and she balked. From what I understand our cheap-o owner does not want us to issue refunds unless except in the most extreme cases. We allow pets without deposit. We also accept cash without a deposit. Insane. He's afraid a deposit will drive down business. I guess he's fine with all the trashed rooms, destroyed linens, junkies/drunks, room damage etc. that comes with a policy like that.

So anyway she said leave them in and make notations if there are any issues and she will deal with it. I wish we could just get them out because they didn't declare their pig which we would have denied along with all the other issues and the fact that they were already DNRd and the new hire screwed up. I've heard her on the phone with the owner before after we issued a higher than normal amount of refunds explaining why. I'm sure Mr. Cheap-o will have a fit about this as well but you know what some people shouldn't be allowed to remain period.

I've already decided to get them out myself if they cause any more issues beyond the numerous complaints they've caused already. After I explain the DNR policy to the new hire I'm going to have him call me first if there are any further issues with the 20 somethings room. If we get a guest complaint I'm going to call dispatch myself and have them evicted then tell my GM lol. I've already decided to start looking for other work soon anyway the owner of this hotel is the worst I've ever had to work for.",23,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CDC9B5E0>
979,Surprise Surprise … Guest Lies About Cancelling Part of Her Reservation,"Guest checked in two days ago and her rates were $90, $90, and $140. She decided to pay for two nights and then said she will decide if she wants to stay the last night.

Coworker told her to let us know 24 hours in advance if she wants to cancel. 

Guest calls me yesterday and confirms she wants to stay the third night. 

Great!

Except not great. She comes to me in the morning and wonders why the rates for today were less than what she reserved. I explain the whole deal about how reservations work. You lock in a rate and we honor that rate. Period. End of story. Good night. 

But she isn’t having any of it because … she cancelled her third night when she checked in. 

Lady, the notes say a different story. The reservation activity says a different story. I trust and know my coworker to say that her story is gonna be different too. 

If she cancelled her last night, I would have told her the new rate when she called to confirm she was staying the third night. 

But nope. She wasn’t having any of it. I tried explaining in my increasingly frustrated tone, but I got met with “I know what I did. I told her that I was cancelling the third night and she cancelled it. So why am I getting charged a higher rate.”

Friends - I am ashamed to say this … but I caved. I fucking folded like a hooker when she sees coke. I even gave her a AAA discount (she asked for it and was getting a discount on the original resv) just to shut her up and go away.

981,Cannot charge card on file without the card being present for a normal reservation.,"Why cant guests understand that for fraudulent reason the front desk cannot charge a card on file without having it present? 

“Ohh my client or family member book this reservation for me and they should have a card on file, just charged it. I don’t understand why its being a problem, and I have never had this problem before with any hotels.”

If your client or family booked a prepaid or OTA reservation then you wouldn’t have this problem, but for fuck sakes this is not a prepaid reservation. How would I know if this card you’re saying is actually belongs to your family? I don’t want our hotel or me being liable for this.

Have them do a credit card authorization instead of just arguing with us for fuck sake

Thank you to anyone that understands my frustration.

*Updates*: We had requested her client to complete the authorization form at check in. Up until she is checking out, the form hasn’t been completed. At the time, we need some sort of payment since she’s checking out and no authorization form has been submitted. We asked her to put down her card for the room payment and when the form has been submitted we will reverse the transaction and refund her. 

What baffles me is that she still doesn’t understand why we need to charge her personal card after we told her the situation. After we charged her personal card and she checked out. She left a huge 1 star review on trip advisor. 
She thinks that we will just let her stay in the room for the entire night and let her checkout without any payment? Like really? Common fucking sense yo!",58,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CDC9B0A0>

983,Stolen Luggage,"Man, two posts in one week. I fucking hate my life.

So we are in peak season, literally oversold all week, and for the next two following. This evening I had a (severely) drunk guest approach me heading from the bar asking how to have his mom pay for his room, and if he could borrow a charger. I would like to note that he approached me at the very start of my shift while I was away from the desk running around so I couldn't actually look it up, but 9 times out of 10 a yes usually means yes, and not ""I'm a fuckin liar."" I'm absolutely the one to blame for HOW MUCH time was wasted on him in the beginning, but just trust me, you need to hear it all for the laugh at the end.

My first question: ""You have a reservation right?"" 

Drunkass: ""yes, I have a reservation, my mom just wants to pay"" 

Me: ""cool, I just need her email and I can send her a form to fill out. I don't have a charger I can lend to the room, but you may use this in the lobby while we get things sorted for you.""

DA: ""Thank you! I'll have my mom call you!""

A couple minutes later he gets a call: ""Hi mom... yes she just needs to fax something to you and we can do it.... yep.... I'll let her know.... Love you bye.... Okay so my mom said to go ahead and fax her.""

**During this call security rolls in some luggage claiming it had been left abandoned outside and sets it behind the desk, rolling it past the guest, and leaving it in clear view of where the guest is sitting.**

Me: ""well I just need to email it to her, can I have her emai-""

DA: ""Ohhhh okay one sec"" he calls someone else ""Yeah I need you to email the hotel so they can send you a thing for your card.... cool, thanks! ... Alright so my brother just messaged you.""

Me: ""What?""

DA: ""Yeah, he just texted you from \[insert brother's email\]""

Me: ""Okay but who did he send it to? I have a personal email and thats the only one I have access to""

DA: ""Yeah, see?"" -shows me text with his brother's email-

Me rolling eyes: ""I'll send that right away"" so I send it right? 20 minutes later its not opened yet.

DA: ""How much is my room again?""

Me: ""What is the last name?""

DA: ""Ass, its under Drunk Ass""

Me: ""I'm not seeing a reservation under that name, when did you book it?""

DA: ""Oh no, I need to MAKE a reservation""

Me: ""Sir... I asked you if you HAD a reservation and you said you did. I'm sold out, I don't have a room for you, and I can't help you any further.""

DA: ""Well you miscommunicated that with me!""

Me: ""Again, I asked if you already had a reservation and you said yes. You do not, and I can not make one for you tonight, I don't have a room.""

DA: ""Well if you would have told me you were sold out I wouldn't have wasted your time!""

Me: ""It didn't matter if I was sold out because you said you had a room, my being sold out wouldn't have had an affect on you if you had a reservation like you said. I can't help you further, please leave.""

So he left! After bragging about finding a room for $30 a night elsewhere. Have fun.

Well.... PD just rolled in an hour and a half later so obviously I go out and ask whats up. Somebody has reported their luggage as stolen. ""Well sir, I have this *LOST* luggage, but certainly nothing stolen to my knowledge."" and he just rolls his eyes, asks if it was left up front, yep, it was.

PD: ""God this guy is so drunk... and hes mad at me for some reason!""

Me: ""Is it Ass?""

PD: ""Yep! Did you talk to him?""

Me: ""Hooooo boy did I ever! \[tells him the story\] and security even wheeled it right in front of his face! Like what?""

PD laughing: ""he's definitely.... something.... well, if you don't want to deal with him I can impound it for security purposes.""

Me: ""PLEASE!""

So yeah.... thats the story about how I had a suitcase arrested.",12,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CDC9B730>
984,I'm officially out.,"I wanted to say thanks to subreddit for letting me know I wasn't the one in the chaotic sea of a job. I had to stop posting stories years ago because the property was small and had other redditors so the stories would not have taken a genius to figure who was sharing them. Anyhow.



Im offically out of the Hospitality field and it feels bitter sweet. Worked 4 years at the hotel, worked doubles, long stretches with no days off, multiple properties, snowed in, dealt with waaay too much shit (both metaphorical and literal), took on extra duties, stayed through COVID, returned early after my stroke. Gave my notice and finished my last scheduled day yesterday. I had not seen management in almost a month due to scheduling differences and I never received a ""appreciation/Good luck"" email, text, or call from the GM. I do not want/need one. This can be a reminder to anyone who says a company cares. Trust me they don't. The moment you're no longer useful that ""care"" disappears. You show up, do your job, take some customer abuse, get shit pay, rinse and repeat. I'm sure the GM and other employees are now proclaiming all my faults and how shitty I was as an employee. Honey, you 12 shades of fucked up if you deny it. As a ""forgotten shadow""(aka Night audit) I have heard and seen the cycle so many times it's predictable as the sun rising. Unfortunately for them I have my work history and past texts proving how I was the go-to fixer by everyone so I know my self-worth. 

I will keep the good memories but shed the toxicity of the workplace.",19,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CDC9B310>
985,You cannot have 15 people in your room lady.,"Welcome to another episode of night audit theater.... 

So just barley settling into work all is quiet all check ins are here just waiting around for calls and walk in at this point. 

Phone rings.... 

Hello thanks for calling.... how can i help you? 

(Can barley hear this person and is super staticy plus think accent) 

Spam- oh sorry phone battery low no internet worky. 

Na-ok? What can i help you with? 

Sp- i need to make reservation for tomorrow. 

Na- ok the rate is .... 

Sp-ok thats fine. 

Na- how many beds do you need?

Sp- 3 

Na- um mam we only have a max of 2 beds in the room. We do not have suites here. Its a standard 2 beds a standing shower toilet tv and sink. 

Sp-ok i need 2 and half then. 

Na- theres only 2 bed in the room. We dont have a pull out couch or anything like that. 

Sp- ok thats fine. 

I start to take her info. Still can barley hear her. 

Sp- do you have hot tub?

Na-no like i said its a standard room. You have a shower tv fridge and thats pretty much it. 

Sp- what about a coffee pot or microwave. 

Na- no. We have one microwave down stairs as well as the coffee pot. 

Sp-so how can i cook? How can i make my macaroni and cheese? Can i bring it up to my room? 

Na-no mam it stays down stairs. As does the coffee pot. Its a big urn for everyone. 

Sp-ok ill just take the coffee pot to my room then. 

Na- no we dont allow that it stays in the lobby its a communal pot for everyone. 

(Just keep in mind the hotel was built in that way. Small new brand . No microwave or coffee pots in rooms.) 

Sp- ok. How many people can be in the room?  

Na- its a 2 bed so no more than 4 ppl at a time. 

Sp- what about 15? I have a buddy coming  

Na- you mean 15 people or a 15 yr old?

Sp- 15 people 

Na- due to fire code regulations we cannot allow that many people into a room at once like that. 4 would be the max. Visiting hours do end around 11pm for quiet time hours. 

Sp- so what if i get them each a room?

Na- thats fine but unfortunately youll need to call back in the morning for the manager cause the rate will change and she has to set up big parties like that. She will be in around 10am 

Sp- whats her name? Whats her race? 

I give her the name and tell her shes African American.  This chick on the phone says something but i make out her saying something like the gm is a racist. 

Sp-whats your name?

At this point aint no freaking way im giving my real name. Its an anonymous call and no telling what she might do. 

Sp- well you are a racist cause you wont let me have 15 people in my room. 

Just keeps going off on saying im a racist for not letting her have that many people in the room 

Na-no mam im just trying to take your reservation and telling you the hotels policies. Having 15 in 1 room is aginst fire code regulation. If youre going to call me that then im going to hang up i do not have to listen to this. 

She keeps on. 

Na- ok bye. 👍 

I just dont appreciate being called that. Nor do i have to keep her on the phone verbally abusing me for no reason. Highly doubt it was a real call its been like a hr and hasnt called back. Leaving a note for am shift not to make a reservation if they try to call agian. 🙃",87,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CDC9B940>
986,"We can't just steal someone else's card for you, sir","A guy came up to the desk to check in, I asked for his ID and a card for incidentals. He said the room should already be paid for, and that he had a debit card but there was no money on it. I apologized and told him I couldn't check him in without it. He decided he'd call his boss for help. After talking with his boss for a few minutes, he passed his phone to me.

>Boss- Hi, I had a few other employees check in the other day and the person said they could check in and they wouldn't hold the deposit on their card, they'd just take an imprint. Can't we do that?

>Bran- We could have, unfortunately your employee already told me there's no money on his card so if damage were to occur the hotel would be out of luck.

>Boss- Can I give you my card?

>Bran- If you send in a credit card authorization form so we have proof that we're allowed to use it.

>Boss- You can't take the card from the other reservation and use that?

>Bran- Uh, no, not unless your other employee came and gave his card and signed for the room.

>Boss- You really don't make it easy, do you?

>Bran- Sir it really wouldn't be very secure if we could just pull credit cards from rooms like that at will, would it? Imagine the mix ups that could happen.

Anyway, he finally relented and agreed to do a credit card authorization but can't figure out how to get the form fillable PDF I sent him to work. So he asked for our email address, which I thought was weird considering I just emailed him, but whatever. Anyway he emails back the form, which appears to have been printed out after having been filled in, then he took a picture and sent it back. So that was funny.",26,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CDC9B250>
987,I'M Not Moving My Car!,"  

The recent storms and fallen branches/trees I’ve been having in my area, lately, reminded me of one of my most favorite instances of karma I’ve ever witnessed. 

As with my previous stories, this occurred at a hotel I was working at in Upstate NY. It was August of 2011 and we were hunkering down in the hotel for the arrival of Hurricane Irene. We were getting all the necessary safety items and emergency lights in place in anticipation of the storm knocking out power at some point in the middle of the night or during the day. 

The night the storm hit us I came in a few hours early before my night audit shift to help with any of the prep and setup. While I was standing at the front desk the local police showed up and asked us if we could clear all of the cars out of the driveway in front of the hotel so that if emergency vehicles needed to access the hotel, there weren’t any cars blocking their way. 

I had my valet guys move the cars over to the large parking lot off to the side and park them square in the middle away from the trees and branches. As I was watching them move cars a guest up and drove his Porsche 911 right into the driveway and parked it along the side. He was walking with a purpose, and before I even spoke to him, I knew what his response was going to be:

*Me: “Excuse me, sir!”*

*Shit-Headed Porsche Driver: “WHAT!?”* 

*Me: “We need you to move your vehicle over to that parking lot so we can keep the driveway clear for emergency services. I can have one of my valet guys move it for you.”*

*SPD: “I’m not moving my fucking car! It stays there where I can see it!”*

*Me: “Sir, this isn’t really an option, it needs to be moved or the police will have it moved.”*

*SPD: “If you or the fucking police so much as lay a finger on that car I’m suing all of you!”*

He stormed off to the bar and that was the last we saw of him that afternoon. The police came back to check on us and saw the car in the driveway. They said, “thought we asked you guys to clear the driveway?” I relayed the story to them and said I could point the guy out at the bar. They just rolled their eyes decided it wasn’t worth the hassle. 

Later that night, as I was running the night audit reports the wind picked up letting myself and the overnight maintenance guy know that the storm was approaching. We stood outside under the porch and watched as the rain and wind started coming in harder and harder. At that point, a police car pulled up and parked in front of us just to make sure we were ok. We asked him if he needed a top up on his coffee since we had just brewed a fresh pot and he took us up on the offer. 

As he got out of his car the wind began breaking off branches on the smaller trees across the road and surrounding the parking lot where we had moved guest’s cars. We went inside the lobby to watch as some of the trees began to sway and break, when all of a sudden we heard **SNAPPPPPP!!!!!!! BOOOMMMM!!!!! CRASSSSHHHHH!!!!** **BEEEEEEEEEPPPPPPPPPPPPP!!!!!!**

One of the largest branches from the tree next to our driveway had snapped off and landed square on the shithead’s Porsche. The 3 of us watching let out a simultaneous “HOLY SHIT!” We sat there stunned when the maintenance guy spoke up, “Uhhhh….you’re the police, shouldn’t you go out there and assess or something?” Policeman responded, “Yeah, probably should write up a report on that.” We were sitting there debating whether we should call the guy in his room when the power went out and we had to abandon that thought and go wake up the employees that were sleeping at the hotel so they could help set glow sticks and lights on all of the floors. 

As the sun started coming up some of the employees started walking the floor to collect the glow sticks and lights when one of them saw the SPD come out of his room and walk over to a window overlooking the driveway. He ran down to the front desk as soon as he heard the guest yell, “WHAT THE FUCK!?” We anticipated the guest storming down to the driveway to survey the damage on his car so we went into hiding, but made sure we had a great view of him walking around his car. 

He came storming back into the lobby and demanded to speak to someone in charge. By that point our GM had already been briefed on the entire situation and was well and truly ready for whatever BS this guy was going to throw at him. I’m not sure what happened after that other than a tow truck had to come and pick up his car. I believe he did try to sue, but there were enough witnesses to corroborate our story that he was asked to move his car for that very reason and he didn’t comply.",82,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CDC9BC40>
988,But I've lost my charger!,"Oh my goodness. This woman.... (TL;DR at the bottom)

So, here I am, wonderful NA working my shift like normal last night. All was quiet, as all the reservations had checked in, when the phone rings.

**9:02pm - phone rings**

Me: (Standard greeting)

Caller: (In a very soft voice; it almost sounds like a small child who can't decide if he/she should add a whining tone to their voice to achieve greater results) Hi. I stayed there last night and I think I left my charger. I was in room 138. Can you go look please?

Me: I am sorry, Ma'am. As I am the only person on staff overnight, I cannot leave the front desk. However, I will leave a note with housekeeping, which comes on at 9am, and if we found one we will call you. (I get her name, phone number, and type of charger and write a note for the day shift and housekeeping).

Caller: Okay. Thank you.

End of situation. Right? Hah. If that was the end, this post wouldn't exist, as you all well know.

&#x200B;

**9:06pm - phone rings**

Me: (Standard greeting)

Caller: (Same lady, in same soft, not-quite-whiny voice) Hi, I stayed in room 138 last night and I left my charger. Can you go look for it.

Me: Ma'am, as I said, I am the only person on staff and I can't go -

Caller: Can you just go check?

Me: I cannot leave the desk. As I said. I have a note for housekeeping, when they come on at 9am. I have your phone number. If we find it, we will call you. (This back and forth of ""can you go look?"" and ""no, I cannot leave the desk"" went on at least 4 more times before she finally moved on to the next part.)

Caller: How far are you from Town X?

Me: (WTF? That was random) We are about an hour and a half. As I said, Ma'am, if housekeeping finds your charger, we will call you. I will likely be sometime after 10am.

Caller: Okay. (She hangs up)

But wait, we still aren't done yet...

&#x200B;

**9:29pm (phone rings)**

Me: (Since I recognize her number this time and I'm getting annoyed, there is no standard greeting) Ma'am, as I have already told you the last two times you called, I cannot leave the front desk. I cannot go and look at room 138 to see if your charger is there.

Caller: But I need my charger!

Me: Yes, Ma'am, I understand that. However, I cannot leave the front desk. That answer will not change no matter how many times you call and ask. I have your phone number. I have left a note for housekeeping, who comes on staff at 9am. Nothing is going to happen until then. If housekeeping finds your charger, we will call you. Until then, every gas station sells chargers for $10-15, and most Wally Worlds are still open and carry a wide variety of charger. As you are apparently in Town X, it will probably be cheaper for you to just purchase a new one.

Caller: I'm so depressed.

Me: (Okay, *that* was out of nowhere) I am sorry, Ma'am. Is there anything else I can help you with? (That was a mistake)

Caller: Can you *please* (whining involved this time) just go look in -

Me: Ma'am, I have already told you multiple times. I cannot leave the desk. Housekeeping will be in at 9am. They will look for it. *If* they find it, someone will call you. Have a good night. (Then I hung up, wanting to avoid another go-round of asking and refusing.)

I honestly thought that was then end. My tone had been very forceful with my last statement, and I thought she had finally gotten the message. I was wrong.

&#x200B;

**7:32 am (phone rings)**

Me: (Standard greeting)

Caller: I was in room 138 the other night and -

Me: (since I recognize the voice and wanted to forestall the back and forth I knew was coming) Ma'am, as I told you *all 3 times you called last night,* I cannot leave the front desk to look for your charger. I have left a note for housekeeping to check when they come in at 9am. If we find your charger, someone will call you. That answer is not going to change, no matter how many times you call. I am sorry that you do not have your charger. Again, I recommend that you go purchase a new one at a gas station or at Wally World. Is there anything else I can help you with this morning?

Caller: (In an even quieter voice, which I honestly hadn't thought possible, but still with the half-whining tone) Nooo.

Me: Then have a great day (and I hung up)

&#x200B;

**7:34am (phone rings)**

Me: *Oh, for the absolute Mother of God! Nope, it's the same lady. I'm not getting on that merry-go-round.* (I ignore the call. During this time, I had called my husband, who helps out around the motel with basic maintenance stuff, and I'm filling my husband in on her situation)

Husband: Wait. Little, short. blond lady?

Me: Yep

Husband: No, she *did* come by yesterday afternoon and look through that room. Manager even helped her look. I offered to help her look and she turned me down. She went in to the room at least twice and spent at least half an hour looking.

Me: Really?! Okay. Thanks for letting me know. (We move on to talking about other things for a few minutes, then I hang up to try and begin my finishing up duties).

&#x200B;

**7:36am (phone rings; it's her again)**

Me: Ma'am, I need for you to stop calling. You apparently had a chance to look for your charger yesterday and didn't find it. Housekeeping will not be coming on until 9am, which is an hour and a half from now. I cannot leave the desk to go look. Nothing is going to happen until at least 9am and since you have already looked, it is most likely not here. I am sorry, but you need to purchase a new charger.

Caller: I stayed in a different hotel last night; how could I look? Can you just go knock on 138 and -

Me: You looked yesterday afternoon. I cannot look for you and I. CANNOT. LEAVE. THE. FRONT. DESK. When housekeeping comes in they will look and if they find it they will call you.

Caller: But you don't have my number!

Me: Yes, Ma'am, I do. You gave it to me the 1st time you called me last night. Now, as I told you all three times you called last night, and now all three times you have called this morning **I cannot leave the front desk. Housekeeping will be in at 9am and they will be able to check the room. If they find your charger, then someone will call you. Please STOP CALLING.** (Then I hung up)

Apparently my last, very-forceful- yet-not-rude tone *finally* conveyed to her that it didn't matter how many times she asked or how pathetic she tried to sound on the phone, I wasn't going to look for her charger right then. Also, given that she said she was in town X, just the gas to drive back here from there would cost more than 2 brand new chargers, so she'd be better off just buying a new one. And if she wanted us to mail it to her instead of coming back to get it, she would be without it even longer.

I really do not understand some people... Hopefully, she doesn't call AGAIN.

&#x200B;

TL;DR - Lady is insistent that I go and check a room for her cell charger and will not take no for an answer. Then I find out that she had already looked in the room for it and couldn't find it, so what the hell!",87,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CDC9B280>

Part of me wished I had phished a bit more and got some more info into what he wanted, but ya know, traces. I got enough info for my MOD report so fuck it, I guess.",85,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CDC9B370>
990,Swingers be swingin’,This one hotel I worked night audit at would host a swinger’s convention every month.  We would close the hotel to normal guests and on Saturday night at midnight only swingers would be allowed to stay.  I have seen stuff on those weekends that I can’t unsee.  One chick flashed me her vagina simply because I was able to get her into a room.  One chick walked out of her room topless.  People would have sex in the pool and mattresses were set up in banquet rooms.  Full out orgies were taking place in the rooms.  The hotel finally had to put an end to it when a group who had checked in Friday (knowing full well that the party started on Saturday) had an orgy in a poolside room with kids in the pool and their drapes open,34,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CDC9BB50>
991,What would you have done (a drunk asshole story)?,"This just happened tonight.

A man came up to me while I was working the desk and turned in a purse. When he did, I reached in to took at the wallet. I found and ID and looked it up. The purse belonged to a guest in house. I tried to call the room but the guest didn’t answer. The man insisted on waiting for the purse owner and planted himself  at the front desk by leaning on the counter. 

After about 20 minutes, I assured him we would hold onto the purse. It belonged to a guest so we would return it to her. He then asked for the name of the guest and her room number. I told him I wouldn’t be giving him that information. He then asked for the purse back. I told him no because it wasn’t his. He then asked for a receipt with a list of all the items in the purse. I also told him no. 

He then tried to say he went to law school and he had every right to the purse since he was the one turning it in. I said that was nice and that I was still not giving him back the purse. He got really angry and again told me that he went to law school, has been to Spain and of course, the ol’ “posession ins 9/10th’s of the law.” 

I stood my ground, told him I am not giving him the purse then took the purse our back office and began to close out my shift. I let my assistant manager deal with him after that. I also called the guests services manager above her and explained what happened and the gsm told me to not give the purse back. 

The purse owner came to the desk shortly after. She had apparently left the bar to go to the bathroom and make a phone call and asked the guy to watch it or something. The restaurant workers told me he was talking big and shooting his mouth off and he was probably pretty drunk. Basically, all this drama could have been avoided. 

I hate drunk assholes.

For real though, what would you have done? Would you have given the purse back or not?",46,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CDC9B550>
992,FIRE!!,"So last night we had a fire at my property.

(No one was injured thankfully.)

It was almost midnight when the hotels fire alarm went off and I thought perhaps it was a mis-alarm, cuz nobody called 911 according to the PBX phones, so I silenced it, went through the panel to see where the alarm was coming from and had security go to check it out. While he went to that area I started getting the phone calls from guests asking if it was real I told them to stand by while we assess the situation. Unfortunately my security is a minimum wage paid out of high school kid and so he gets to the area and says he see a little smoke and a lot of water. Now the panic sets in, I personally rush over to see what's going on cuz I'm asking him for details but doesn't give me anything. Get there and the housekeeping area is blechijg out white smoke, so I know it's not a wood or that property is fully on fire.

I yell at the security to repull the fire alarm seeing as I silenced the initial alarm, but he's panicking and doesn't know what to do. So I run through the smoke to pull the closest alarm and set the alarms blaring again. And go to the atrium to get the guests to evacuate!

Now i tell security to go to the front lobby doors and instruct him to tell the guests to head over to the mall. Of course he fails at this and everyone is congregating at the breezeway. I'm calling 911 telling the dispatcher I have white smoke and the fire sprinklers have gone off in the housekeeping department. And while I'm still on the phone with dispatch I see guests lingering on the rails looking down at me in the atrium like this isn't a real fire. I'm screaming at them to evacuate and some take their time and others are going to the elevators, some even bring out their full luggage! 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️

I am so disappointed in these people. 

Luckily in the end it was a dryer fire. And no one was injured from the time the initial alarm went off to the point everyone was safely back in their rooms it was about an hour.",43,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CDC9B610>
993,Why I do it...,"We recently had a popular fast food restaurant open up near my property and because they hadn't fully staffed it yet they had to have employees and supervisors, etc, show up and train and work it till they had enough employees to let the training wheels off.

Well the employees came from different cities and even different states and have been with us for the last 2 months. And I have to say they didn't complain they were model guests. They would sit in the breakfast area after their shift ended at 2am to have dinner and were never loud.

So today was their checkout day and there was at least 30 of them checking out. And each one of them thank me/hotel for making their stay amazing. It's really bittersweet because you get to know these guests and chat with them, and now they're gone and to have them come away from their families to work at this restaurant for 2 months and then leave, it's was a happy sad moment. As they packed up their vehicles to go to the airports or back to their homes I made sure to stand outside and wave to all them as they drive away. They were the best guests and I will miss them.

Their kindness and respect makes it worth dealing with Karen's and Ken's at the front desk. Sometimes we just have to remember why we do the job we do and the positives will always outnumber the negatives.

(Update: I emailed the corporate offices the day of, and called the restaurant manager and told them how amazing their staff was.)",64,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CDC9B1C0>
994,Anybody else having issues with incorrect reservations?,"I don't know if there has been something in the water recently, or if all the OTAs have just suddenly made their reservation systems incredibly confusing, but I have had 4 (yes, 4!) reservations in the last 3 days where the following happens:

Me: *Oh, look! New reservation in the system for tomorrow. Yay! Let's pre-assign them a room so that housekeeping knows exactly how many rooms HAVE to get cleaned tomorrow morning (we are a small motel and currently understaffed, so not all rooms get cleaned immediately...mostly because one housekeeper is a lazy drunk that the boss won't fire for some reason...anyway)*

Sometime later that evening, in walks a person. We'll call them RP, for Random Person.

Me: Hi! How can I help you?

RP: I'm checking in.

Me: Do you have a reservation?

RP: Yes. (Side note: Why do people never volunteer their name at this point?)

Me: What is the last name, Sir/Ma'am?

RP: It's Person.

Me: *Looks at today's reservations and don't see the name ""Person."" Looks at tomorrow's reservations and see the name ""Person.""* Ah. Your reservation is actually for tomorrow night. I do have some rooms available for tonight, though, and can make a new booking for you. The rate for the room is (and give them the rate for the type of room they had made the reservation for. This, by the way, is always between $15 and $20 more than the discount reservation they had made through Suxpedia.)

RP: That's more than my reservation! I'm not paying that much! Can't you just use the reservation I made?

Me: I do apologize, but our system does not allow us to make any changes to reservations made through OTAs. You would need to contact the OTA in order to do that. (This, by the way, is still a possibility for all but one of the instances in which this happened, as the guests had both made the reservation and arrived prior to 10pm - though I don't know how they screwed up the dates, since that's usually only something that happens when idiots make reservations after midnight.).

Oddly enough, none of them wanted to try and make the change through the OTA, but just went ahead and just paid the walk-in rate.

Me; (After processing the check-in) There you go, Ma'am/Sir. And please make sure you contact the OTA to cancel the incorrect reservation so that you aren't charged a no-show fee. (Again, the odd thing is NONE OF THEM did this, so they all were still charged for the reservations that had been made in error. LOL)

For the one guest who *didn't* take advantage of booking a new room, it was because her brother had made the reservation for her and her boyfriend. Apparently the boyfriend was playing a gig at a local bar in town. Funnily enough, the reservation was *supposed* to be a prepaid reservation, and the brother had even called to make sure that he could pay for the reservation online while putting it in his sister's name for her to stay, telling me that he was going to pay for it and filling me in on the apparent rockstar boyfriend. (Spoiler: the boyfriend was *not* a rockstar) However, not only did big brother screw up the date of the reservation, but he didn't pay for it, either. To make things even more confusing, when I was explaining to her that the reservation was on the wrong day and, no I cannot change it, she tried to tell me that her friend had made the reservation and paid for it already. I had to let her know that, while I had the reservation (again, for the following night), it had not been pre-paid, but was instead marked as ""Pay at Hotel."" So, regardless of which night she stayed, she was going to have to pay for the room.

When I quoted the walk-in rate to the person, her faux-hipster-wannabe-goth boyfriend got all uppity and said it was more than the online rate (um, yeah, Suxpedia does discount the rates, so walk-in rates are gonna be higher, genius, and no, we aren't going to give you the Suxpedia rate) and they aren't paying that much in a real snooty voice, then turned around to walk out. The girlfriend clearly wanted to just get a room and was hesitating even while the boyfriend was walking out, so the boyfriend had to come back to the desk and take her by the arm to pull her out of the lobby. Not sure if they were going to try another hotel at 2am, or were just going to drive to wherever home was, but they weren't staying here. I would also like to point out that there is no way the boyfriend had just played a set with a band at the bar identified by the brother, as he wasn't all sweaty from being under the spotlights, but instead looked like he'd just gotten dressed to go out 20 minutes beforehand.

&#x200B;

So far, I haven't had a day-early guest show up this evening, but the night is still young. LOL. I just don't understand how you could make a reservation and not check the dates of said reservation (and whether or not you've actually paid, in the case of the last one) BEFORE finalizing everything.

Anyway, that's been a smattering of what I've had to deal with the last couple nights. I am hopeful that whatever moon phase/planetary alignment/poisoned water/drug or alcohol usage/general stupidity or dumbassery that has caused these individuals to not be able to tell what day it is and make their reservations correctly has passed. But, then again, based upon my recent experience with the general public, I don't think it will be the last time it happens.

995,I hate our contracted airline crews(rant),"I can honestly say I’m so glad I’ve never been on plane before.

My hotel is contracted with 3 major airlines. We are the only hotel in our area that has its own shuttle, so we’ve had these crews for about 4 years now. Some of the crew members are nice and others are entitled.

We recently got back one of the three airlines cause the other is scheduled for this month (November) so as we got this new crew back, their already bitching about our hotels van times. Which we have a person scheduled to come in and do those shuttles then leave, it’s not every 30 mins as we aren’t a major city and the shuttle is only for airlines only. 

Well we are about 25 mines out from our airport which is a small airport. This crews van time was 4:22am and guess what time their report time is 5:15am plane actually leaves at 5:30am. The crew actually had the nerve to say they wanted to leave at 5am and will wait for my shuttle to get back from dropping off the first crew to leave out at 4:22am. 

I told the pilot fine, but I’m not rushing my shuttle driver and if she gets back and can’t do it they’ll have to find their own way their. I had a time set for them but if they want to whine about getting their an extra 10 mins early. I don’t care.

I’m just fed up with airlines abusing my desk workers and me on NA when I literally do not have anything do with day shift or van times(which is set by my manager and THEIR AIRLINE ITSELF) 

Sorry if this kinda messed up, I’m doing this on my phone and just needed to rant.

Edit: so I guess I have to make it clear for everyone since I’m getting so much hate. These van times are usually set by the Airlines themselves! We have them send over paperwork and they give us the van times for the crew members. 

We have SET van times for a reason as I stated before because we are not a super high end hotel in a major city. We are a small 6 floor hotel with only 2 floors with fridges/microwaves which we have reserved for airlines. We try out best to work things out with airlines IF given notice.

The ONLY time we EVER change vans times cause we need to is for delays. Also with winter coming up we NEVER change the van times cause roads get super bad here in Michigan so it takes an extra 10-15 mins to get to the airport making it an also 30-35 min ride. 

I’m just the NA who deals with the very last shuttle of the night. 

Now with this crew they are a TWO night stay meaning they didn’t come in around 11pm and having to wake up for an early flight. They came in and have an extra day to relax and then get up the next day. My hotel right now is super dead, so they should be able to get plenty of sleep. 

But over this past year we have had airline after airline YELL at us over van times. I’ve actually emailed these airlines over specific crew members because they ARENT allowed to change van times. It’s apart of OUR contract with these airlines. 
 
I’ve had crew members come back and apologize for how other people acted and find out that, let’s say a pilot yelled at me and next time I see the crew again; the pilot isn’t with them. Why? Well because the pilot got in trouble. 


It’s not just about the van times with these airlines. They think they are entitled to just about everything, which isn’t true. They are here on WORK, meaning they are here representing their airlines. But acting this way, I can basically tell people, you mine as well not take this airline or something to guests if they ask. 

So maybe some of y’all don’t understand because you don’t have to deal with them on a day to day bases. I’m not bashing airlines because I like it but because a few bad seeds tainted the way I see them.

But overall,’there are some good crew members that I like, I do get a regular to my hotel and I love speaking with him. 

NOW then end of my rant!",20,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CDC9BCD0>
996,Is parenting that hard…?,Seriously tho? Why do I constantly find kids all over the hotel with no parent in sight? Like toddlers to 10 year olds just wandering for 10 minutes to hours before a parent comes into the lobby and gets them. I’ve had a 2 year old wandering about and right out the front doors before I had to escort it back inside. Mom finally came and got them after 5 minutes. Tonight I had two boys 8 and 10 in the lobby and dining room for 4 hours before their mom came out and told them to go to bed. Like I know I’m at the front desk the whole time but I’m not a babysitter. I have my own child and not for a second would I ever be ok with my 4 year old leaving my sight for even 30 seconds. Does anyone else deal with this?,38,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CDC9BDF0>
997,Money can make or break you,"I'm actually disappointed that this guests name matches his personality. Just think Monster energy, holes in the wall, etc. but we will name him Jake.

Jake comes in with a friend, they both have separate rooms. Friend went to bathroom, Jake asks for ATM and their driver comes in HOT. Driver starts telling me that Jake is refusing to complete payment and he will be waiting in the lobby for payment. Keep in mind, in true Monster drinking fashion he continuously got more aggressive and hostile.

Jake: ""What are you doing here old man? I'm done with you, you need to get in your car and leave""

Driver: ""Sir, if you do not pay me I'll call the police and they WILL arrest you. This is a serious crime.""

Jake: ""Well good luck with that!""

Driver: ""I have all your information and I'm going to call. You're keeping me from my work now and I've lost clients, pay me or I'm dialing.""

Me: ""Sir, what room are you in?"" 

Jake: ""4200. Well I'm not paying.""

Driver: ""Why not?""

Jake laughing and mocking: ""Because I'm broke you idiot, you're fucked""

Me: ""Sir, if you refuse to pay this man because ""you're broke"" you are leading me to believe you can't pay for this room and you will be asked to leave. Please pay him.""

Jake: ""But he doesn't work for the hotel, it doesn't matter""

Me: ""I will have to help him with the police as I am a witness.""

Jake: ""Fine""

Jake goes back to the ATM, I call security and fill him in. As Jake walks by to go back to his room he throws the cash at me on the desk and started to walk off. After making sure the driver got his money:

Me: ""Hi yes, thank you for throwing money at me, but now you really need to leave. You have been nothing but hostile and rude to everyone working in this building, my staff or not, and you want to throw things. You need to go.""

Jake: ""But can I go get my stuff?""

Me: ""Absolutely, you can get your stuff and leave.""

Jake: ""But like.... can I have a bed? What about my shit?""

Me: ""Again, you can get your 'shit' and leave, but that is your only option.""

Jake: ""Alright, but I'll be talking to your manager in the morning.""

Me: ""Thats perfectly fine. I've been here for over 10 months and I've built a reputable relationship with her. I'll be reporting this, and they'll be reviewing the camera footage as well, but you can feel free to reach out to her in the morning.""

It took security 5 minutes to escort him back to his room, all while being argumentative and hostile.

Jake: ""I need security's name and employee number on a card.""

Me: ""Well his name is 'Jake"" (same as guest), but he is from a third party company so he does not have an employee number.""

Jake: ""GIVE. ME. HIS. EMPLOYEE. NUMBER. AND. NAME.""

Me: ""Again sir, his name is the same as yours, but he does not have an employee number. Here is my managers card, have a great night.""

Jake: ""You better write down his name, I have better things to do with my time than remember that.""

Me *-writing aggressively-*: ""I'm so sorry you find it difficult to remember you own name *-slams manager's card on desk with 'Jake' written on it-* have a great night.""",16,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x00000147CDC9B760>
